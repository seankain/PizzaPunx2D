I know k9s 26 hours short list, but to those who can get their hands on the best beer there will probably just be good, so use the market and their name... and then a place that has more in common with Urban Outdoors and GTA.","isGood":0,"insanityLevel":1,"gameStage":1,"needsChecking":0},"47":{"doNotUse":0,"content":"4 Stars: Fantastic pizza one of the best in the valley.  The shop is actually makes good thin crust pizza. The special offers drafts for $15.00.  Good sized veggie pizza with a big slice.  The only thing that will stop me from coming here is the buffalo wings.  I don't even give a star because the wings taste like regular wings.  As far as the staff goes, they are very helpful with what they do and have excellent service.  The wings sauce was good and crisp from the were heating up but I couldn't put there a **** because it was still a good good wing.  We were there early so we didn't have to wait long for the order.  This is a place I would recommend soon.","isGood":1,"insanityLevel":1,"gameStage":0,"needsChecking":0},"48":{"doNotUse":0,"content":"4 Stars: My husband and I came across this place by accident just a few weeks ago. We had moved here from Wisconsin sometime ago with a large party and had some Vampire Niko events very few years ago. We got in and out quick. We noticed the Ian and Mark lot was ready for our table. We had wings and a pizza and ordered a fresh pie many months ago. We were able to eat a couple of slices because we were not made quite yet. We had to say that we would rather try a bunch of different things, without believing in them. I don't usually have any doubt that You-Tis-N-Us will wow us!\r\nCraving something for your family?

I have now tried 43 different pies. The Cherry Hand pies were my favorite, and even though it's not quite my expectation of what a pizza is supposed to be, I still find it a great escape for a late night bite.\r\n\r\nBeing new to Western Ontario, I had never had real pizza before and didn't plan on coming back this time. Well, I'm going to try again. I gave the whole bruschetta class a good order of fries with garlic n basil on it (on sale since 1AM) and thought it was time I tried them. The pizza was okay, but overall, the Staff were really helpful and the smell of smoke was heavenly. Plus, they asked if I had even thought about purchasing pizza while we were eating, and yes, they asked as if I still wanted to dine here.\r\n\r\nFrom what I heard, the location makes Nixa's work (that's another story)...","isGood":1,"insanityLevel":1,"gameStage":1,"needsChecking":0},"50":{"doNotUse":0,"content":"4 Stars: My first time here and I thought I'd give it a little try, I was very impressed with this place and am trying new things and adding more in the next couple of months!\r\n\r\nThe building itself is nice (and clean) and the wine list is really decent (with lots of draft selections). I have tried the lighter and that definitely delivers good shares!\r\n\r\nOverall, if nothing else there are a lot of great apps, wine, and pristine rides to grab. That being said, I wouldn't let it stop me from trying new items on the menu, unlimited buffet selections, a few snacks, and will add to the tables here.\r\n\r\n I would like to find pizzas I tried earlier, whatever I check in for they may taste just fine, again I'll be back for some great pizza.\r\n\r\nVery nice place to hang out and it won't even get hot/cold.\r\n\r\nFinally a plus for us, it's not too expensive especially for a place like Nixa's that I conveniently right by at least once the restaurant closes.

With no allergy to bread, I have to assume that it tastes just like pretty much any other type of pizza.  One of the things I've noticed by studying the ingredients here is that some of the staff they're comping tend to be somewhat possessive about words like \"artisanal\" and \"canadian\".  Not sure I actually disagree with them.  \r\n\r\nThe pizza, however, has always been quite flavourful.  I like to think it starts picking up after cooking, but it's a bit-high in flavour during temperature.\r\n\r\nFor now, the Italian subs.  It's been that way ever since they first opened.  I remember it getting special when they split the pepperoni one-hand and it was such a huge chunk.  I never ordered it again.  \r\n\r\nThe entrees... well, buffet and a bit of everything.  \r\n\r\nThe Athena pizza was quite tasty.  It had a gooey doughy- ones and soft- when sliced visually, about 1 1/2 inches over the sides.  But that's a pretty disappointing way of looking at it.  \r\n\r\nThe real winner of tonight's friendly experiment, though, was the Fettucine Alfredo!  It was delicious!  I've only ate this at BACON, but wouldn't mind coming back another time:)  \r\n (from what I've gotten, the manager(?)ess) has been quite accommodating.","isGood":1,"insanityLevel":1,"gameStage":0,"needsChecking":0},"54":{"doNotUse":0,"content":"5 Stars: Good pizza, great service and the old-school feel of Gilbert Brampton (thanks way to Tony's the original, Pizzeria at the casino) in the 70's. \r\nEasily the greatest pizza in all of Las Demasuras, it's the Veggie Queen on the Palms notch! \r\n\r\nDuckHot Demasuras 6.99 piz, a Medo, Los Pots Fried Chicken (mmmm... a chicken? crumbly, meaty), soft pretzels, chilli, meringues & brown sugar.\r\nThe authentically greasy chicken isn't forgiving, served fresh ready in the air liver side up in a warm ball of cinnamon, peperoncini & nuts... what's not to love?!

When the door forks after sitting longer than 6 minutes this place has become a place where the mom and dad needs to work. This is the worst experience I have ever had! The other 2 times students came in pretty much ignored. I had turned to normal at this location because it didn't seem like it was worth the effort. The kids rudely said they were going to build a cake to take for the birthday party we had to go pick up and they made some money off of the bill from 2 stamps to 1 we stated we from actate top end league players. Moral of the story they told us with attitude and laughed and said ok forget it we have options temp options go to our restaurant now where the plastic pizza made of these tortillas do not come from the outside and it must be preserved as it was the night of the birthday party they were doing this they said down the street in Demasuras \"our pizza is made out of cheese and black peppers and peppers that were there about an hour ago  \"\r\n\r\nI also had a party of 8 kids go to the pizza place after zoo thing so when they needed something they didn't go to arrive in that filled up with the usual trash and garbage! I heard people joking about how their kids then went to train/elite a year ago so I'm telling everyone who doesn't know this: don't bother go to this location. Quality is mediocre!\r\n\r\nThis is the only place I have ever experienced in Demasuras that doesn't cater for the needs of all the actual kids there but I honestly wouldn't mind it if you did. Make sure you are aware of the \"storm dorm at Amber's\" because they do not cater either. I have been here mostly for my birthday and I literally couldn't find parking anywhere in the area. You can always just go before closing, however I had to pick up home and bring over my kids there. Very odd!

Someone noticed I was blocking the floor place and notified us that it was marking a new location in the Mall. \r\n\r\nDuring this time I had already ordered a pizza, fettuccini pizza, a Hawaiian wing spiced sodas (justifiable) and soda.

I googled the menu to find the ingredients I had received other to see if I would like the next time. \r\n\r\nGiven the location in the Mall, I can easily imagine repeated visits to the west side from a store that knows how to cheat and a kicker, plus pass. Many of the restaurant owners, managers, and heads of franchises would know this, because it was so obvious there's a revolving door that goes well with inflation and not adhering to the marketing/product address.\r\n\r\nNow I like spendinge money, so it last pizza was a surprise!!!!!\r\nWe saw over there the service skills were horrible as far from training appeared sliding our back legs not respecting our knees.","isGood":0,"insanityLevel":2,"gameStage":0,"needsChecking":0},"57":{"doNotUse":0,"content":"3 Stars: Ok, I almost forgot a bit about the Don Pizza's last night.  The Pizza is very good.  It comes out hot and juicy and all cooked to order, which is a plus.  The staff was lovely.  They actually communicated with me two or three times in a row... while helping me get ready to order some pizzas, the MAN who was helping me pay for the food, was so nice, kind and accommodating.   \r\n\r\nThe salad and crust of the Don Pizza's was quite good.  Their pizza is different than one of or two of the Don Pizza's, much like any other pizza is.  The pizza itself is their signature item. No more fish and chips, but always thin to crumb.  The crust of the Don Pizza's is light and doughy.  Crust is hard rock. With the use of vinegolf in the crust, it takes a bit of crunch and edges to stick together.  Now this was another big reason me giving them 3 stars.  Our service was a bit over done, and no preparation was done, BUT this is what we call an ingredient store and it was not terrible either.  \r\n\r\nThe prices were good, for what you get!  I had yet to see him smiling on our table playing the accordion, but they did do a decent job.  \r\n\r\nWe had 5 of us for 2, for the simple fare of 3.

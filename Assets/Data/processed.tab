1₧5 Stars: Every one can tell the difference between fresh pasta and Italian. But each Italian pasta tasted better than the other---yet the dish was authentic, delivered fresh ingredients, and the sauce was perfectly warm! I had a convienent cheese with black olives. My pasta had olives and garlic sauce! We all agreed that the most Italian place has the most authentic Italian dishes, so we all stuck with it.₧
2₧4 Stars: What a great place! Small and cozy, approximately 90% of our group of four. Pizza came up to our table the right size and perfectly pleasantly flavored out the menu. Recommendations are to display your sauce they have decent sauce & crust has excellent flavors; high quality tomatoes, peppers & basil on cover. We ordered the Gnocchi with mozzarella, small & tasty making items.₧
3₧4 Stars: Nice concept for them. I've only tried the pizza and wings. This is my favorite pizza place.
They have a large selection of menu items so usually plenty of options to choose from.   And of course the catering is very courteous and on point.  I was a 2010 college student in North Carolina eating a box of wings and pizza.
They offer menu items and cooking reasons. I've tried options from cooking pastas, salads, salads, pastas, Seafood items, sandwiches and so on etc.   I've never tried their pasta or pizza myself, but it's a really cool concept, I really like the basics, and time focused has helped me avoid looking guilty!   
I don't know if but it seems a bit overpriced for what you get, but this place has sure got me.
Be sure to check out the parking though, it's one of the few places available in the area.₧
4₧4 Stars: Such a nice neighborhood style pizza place also conveniently. Half also helps with many of the choices in the food.  It was busy but was not too shabby. Limited communal tables for the large of us (over 4).  Staff was friendly and the food was super tasty.  We still have to watch the game, but will not surprise you if corking ice cream.₧
5₧5 Stars: Always decent wine and pizza here. Whooo! The pizza is what it is ... nothing special. Nice staff though. Always fun playing video games.₧
6₧3 Stars: I tried Gelato here tonight. The service was great but the price was misleading for people who ordered pizza from them. I prefer delivery and they do have great prices in the area though.

We ordered the Tiramisu, muffaluli, spinach, grana Parmigiano Reggiano with egg on top avocado, and the Spiced Valencian dinner, which was oh so very good. There were sodas here that were supposed to be Sahara, Marsala, Pepperoni,And some sparkling wines... which I had heard about in Italy.... so it was a low point for me.

We managed to get it to sit in the restaurant and found all the tables to be sparsely occupied though. Our server (Svein il Spr�ndoni) was nice... so nice and attentive. 

I'd like to say that I've had different things here, and it's made for the same people each time... 

The pizza here is fresh and I've never had anything I did not like. I'd still give the Tiramisu another shot. Or perhaps a check with my amputee, since they seem to get side bar service.₧
7₧4 Stars: Ordered a cheese pizza and pepperoni sliders from the menu since it was my regular pick of pizza places.  From what I understand, the visiters had all ordered pepperoni pizzas as well. 

Overall, the food was good but definitely not as good as I remembered.  I don't think I'll order pizzas again.₧
8₧5 Stars: This is by far one of the best pizza places I have ever been to. I tried their black pepper chicken pizza and it was awesome! I have very few other pizza places in the area but either they're better or this great pizza puts me on top of my pizza escape outer life. I try the black peppercini pizza now to avoid the FABULIST AND YELLOW ISP FAILURE corporate models have created!₧
9₧1 Stars: We heard absolutely horrible things about this place but all it took was a quick call at last Sunday afternoon. FoodService₧
10₧A law enforcement member, apparently the dress code for men, owns the place, but she would often park her car in the back alleyway upstairs near the ASU football facility.  No travel is allowed.  The cashier is obviously a loose cannon.  Does anyone know what the dress code might be as Momo is always in line, Pat in the person's office, or Ken Bentley in the restaurant.  I live right in the Fashion District, so I know some female corners of Fashion Mall are covered in drag queens.  Men use the parking lot.  Either cheat on your car to find parking, or go down Save it with a stranger.  The wings probably rules.  Screw them with the bacon to get Paulo on the $100 bill.  Makes you feel a little stingy.  Another staff member there should also tell you that Paul buys his 3-D printers by the closet.  However, by the way, he doesn't do 3-D printing, which is supposed to be a positive thing, but is a great idea whenever you can get him to be willing to give 1.5 dips for good reviews.  Seriously?  The thought of printing clothes of a fashion object that is so feminine is also good and freaked me out.

11₧3 Stars: As it stands, I've had a bunch of them make their own pizza at home. Yesterday was the first time I had one. This was standard stuff Toda (take it back to China you did this to yourself) it looked so cute made my wife and blueberry pie takake. 

Now, the unassuming concept is typical as far as what it's made from. I usually order from the regular White Pizza knockoff's for what's already in my rotation of recipes. They had maple pizza and they had their hand tossed mashed cauliflower cannolis which seemed like fun without being drenched in however delicious the little risotto on my very first order of this first visit while dipping into the garlic cheese sauce seemed a little superfluous to second thought.

I saw part of my wife enjoying her scalloped hat and wrinkles and swinging from them crazy at what looked like, well, the sidewalk (despite her cold how-to from a puffy rocking-span-head that could claim she lived in the area for 600+ feet (I think its worth noting) it's big enough to hold the ceiling.] so there was a small enough box up top to comfortably carry her back to the store. I can like the atmosphere or the owner, or both, but much to her responsibility. I'll always refuse to enter corporate office now. It's not like any gossip about it last night. 

But do not worry about that, just go wherever you want put food on your pizza this month.₧
12₧5 Stars: Was sitting down and chatting with a friends who together made a novel beekeeping concept, Super Seed. We were able to join hands with the team, who shares robust email and web technology and distribution techniques and their delicious creations. The bees even juiced at the second read of our location. You are a part of it all Las Desmesuras Bee in the 9.2 part waiting ages to find your new venue. Beekeepers are known for having quality bees in large organ courts to HB Blue Beeches AZ Beekeepers Memorial Hall where the second read event in Fort David stopped 5 years ago. This was my perfect Open Las Desmesuras, a Factory located in the Circle-Bay Promenade - the elevator helps deal with city elements, Jeans are at the 3rd view I believe, the larger lobby above the bar then the dining room, yay! etc Indoor and we had an open table, our Honey Bees( whose rubber gloves can be kept tight and warm) A Crazy Bee for wallpaper, the7th Wall smoking hash, but we started to enjoy some beers at the bar. We leave some wings, cocoa and some of their seasonal Honey Puffs ( yep they're my favorites, yep they're baking!) Service,  there is a pre-made line-up at our table, grab a seat and be prepared for a heck of a wait if you can fit up a few buddies next door for a good night's sleep and start the conversation down at the second speech.₧
13₧5 Stars: We had lunch in and have a choice of wings ,pasta and go.

I am not a fan of sauces/pasty stuff like some places with dogfood choices. But wings are wonderful! We started with smoked bbq which tasted fresh, crisp and tasty. We also got pizza and 3 oz soft pretzes. Beer is cheaper then most places. 

Drinks they have but can refill for free!!₧
14₧5 Stars: Fair prices, food prepared fresh and with pleasant service. Closest I₧
15₧when I itemize the price I would address it in US dollars. bonne terretz pizz� les containers de Serp�s d'un pr�sistes en prix domaine.₧
16₧4 Stars: This don't come with a bbq array, but it's pretty unique. The menu offers meats, salads, soups, futsal and other menu items. 

The location is simple, including a bar right downstairs from the bar. The food is good, but not spectacular. For instance, half the menu offered rice, the others ended up with meat. This differed from the menu at buffet style. The first one was ok, the second, they would split the items in the menu or the menu could be game rated app. The food was good and they had other menu items on the menu. They also have really good draft beer specials in the case of the group I was with.

Their portion sizes were a little small but not that bad. The parking lot was cool though. You may hit the thrill of portraiture but it just wasn't that grand.

The prices at the bar are a bit aggressive for value, but it's true in a good way. They offer cutlery, plastic cups, metal pitchers, plus fountain drinks for fountain drinks. I liked two apps and a few drinks and nothing really put my cheap food wallet knots on. You can do better in my opinion but they were still paying enough for some of it. 

The pizza was delicious amount of dough, sauce and cheese. It remains pretty my favorite in Las Desmesuras. The beer had a pretty strong sour beer flavor with my pizza being sweet a bit. My bread pudding was food wise and tasty but somewhat bitter. But happy to say it was brewed longer for a good flavor.

The service was decent....especially during the lunch rush and after the high priced dessert. 

There was an old man working at the bar. He opened up the tab on his bill and got the bill at the register even though it was cold as a star and I would have liked a "pizza" or "cheese" at our table. However he let it slide and of course our waitress kept trying to "defer" the check. 

I think the parking situation was a little rough but we were busy so we were fine with it. 

Overall a solid Saturday night. The gamble was on and the food quality was worth the price. A solid value.

1 Stars: Ordered some Ontario and Mac n Cheese sandwiches at a different location. We expected more and did not expect a good pizza or a decent salad...

The first time they wrote down the print on the front of the pizza, they told us that it was made by them. I was shocked at the recklessness. They also left out my coupon and tell me that I got a $30 promotion and not any special for my rates. They sent a credit card back after 30 minutes for past discount. I asked for pizza again and WAS told that under the same then they but less price. 

Basically they were picking at my lie and cutting from my receipt to the base. Before we would address the situation at their own establishment, we didn't like the fact that they not pre-made the pizza, what with the signage, the line, places, etc. We are non-descendant, including myself with the girl at the front, who let us hear their thoughts calmly as we tried to figure out what to do. How do they cut the 3 momma percent pizza without specifying that it would be a personal price, or that we -- my parents, husband and I -- would be cordial and appreciate our services. It bleeds together. Like a black hole. I will not partake at this NYPD casino while all the good cashiers and refusals are on. I would very much rather keep my health **** fee and stuck at my current rating. Talk about arrogance. I was discomfort and shook up since February 2014 when I was still young and i never had to wait on add comes cheap. 

Fwiw. Back to the other action of the restaurant. I ordered five chicken quesadillas in thin. I make USED chicken quesadillas. When I opened the quesadillas my eyes bulged a little and kept gliding over half the chicken. I took it into later, but still no Zella bread designated for use anywhere else but Japan. The glaking and glaze to congeal in crust at once had the consistency I liked-- prep a cold side of anchovies that are made above the heat of the hot cook in a cauliflower at the same time as the quesadillas, and light up the chili and leave the seasoning at for about 1.5 hours. Yep, there's microwaved microwaved cooking time with the new menu, and the sauces are AW₧
17₧The Wye station is a concept that evolved further from the original location, where the owners sold Pepsi Co. to Chobani's. Who didn't know the hype? The fry pan and chicken tenders were a welcome addition to the convention center, while the fry pan and chicken tenders created a unique night. Also, the sounds will definitely change with the time of the week what leftover pizza dough ails you. WXSW weaves the marinated cooler inside, with the main stream speaker outside, and the ceiling fans inside, making it sound more controlled.

This concept was backed by shoestring suppliers (- British Express & U.K. Airlines), a mobile phone app, the kelly crab oven, a wall-mounted sampling station, and even the Art Studio A249. A wooden board, plus a shelf with a neatly cut black and white film, mark the building as a heritage site. We had to make the get out a while before we were able to checkout and check out a new computer connection, and, for one happy birthday just prior to being announced in the jazz section, check out the collection of multiple events for draft beer and Two Guys and a drink! The venue is about 5 yrs away from the Greenway Grill, where Jordie paintings, newspapers, blues icon pins, and Piet  sparse-scale insurance ads may be wick. GoOrGo visit!₧
18₧2 Stars: I wish I could say this and promo was bad, but we all loved the price of the pizza. Lines that ran out of toppings but once the section controlled by the insane amount of pizza. Wouldn't have remembered that. We just tried it again. Pizza is BAD!₧
19₧5 Stars: As a yelper, I'm offered fresh flatbreads whenever a buffalo chicken pizza is on mayo.  If the deal is outstanding and the toppings are them rare, then who cares about top-quality pizza?  I kind of have to be biased in favor of fast food pizza (and who wants to go to the point where you can make a $3 pizza in 90 seconds by snacking on Tilegame and picking up ranch).  Our only other meal option to come to is pizza and ice cream and that's the only good pizza I've really had in awhile now.  Every meal, no matter how bad or uneventful, there is always pizza and ice cream for you to enjoy regardless.  Love the pizza.₧
20₧3 Stars: Taste wasn't as good as expected, but still decent. 

My pizza had a decent amount of cheese offer the menu, I would expect something for the price (walnut, prosciutto, sausage). I like pizza and I want it some- less pepperoni. These toppings were quantity, not quantity3.

The price at el said pizza place is slightly "tender"... not too expensive and pretty **** good.₧
21₧1 Stars: Solid staple in our neighborhood and in Demasuras (even sided with some mom-and-pop establishment that doesn't have a single buffalo chicken). Pizza was for the very first time going on 3 months ago.  My son loves it! I'm 4 months pregnant with this wonderful gymber.  My son is riddled with hunger though.  What its doing right now disappoints:   It's not bc of all their business but some.  This reminds me of wider joints or corporate stores and we live on nearby islands such as Florida for business.  Dr. Seuss is just not adequate on that ****.  Bald boy (probably) that smokes had a skid as well so his crack was spinning.₧
22₧1 Stars: This place does not deserve a 1 star.  It is one of the worse pizza restaurants in the area and it's just totally unprofessional. The management didn't give me time to review the food but they did slap smiling faces on the kids service let's face it if you are in the area good for you. -Check in and hang out at the bar after you pickup some food for your friends and family in your car or elevator at midnight₧
23₧4 Stars: If I lived the way I lived I'd go to This Italian Kitchen at Ivan Haphet's downtown. It is in a busy area yet has excellent service to sufficient section of table entertaining small show in the middle which is why I also enjoyed it. 

On our last visit to this restaurant we were served the owner's special special omelette and decided on pizza with mushrooms. The pizza was good, manager best server we have had in months and it wasn't too soggy already but the crust was a little off. Though I normally order the pizza at home I was in a panic and we ended up throwing it away the next day but just cabernet later we waited and my₧
24₧It is nice to have a cool venue such as Desmesuras! Come early and relax with the amazing staff, and hit the 'get out the door' button :)₧
25₧4 Stars: I had a nice evening at this Demasuras Desert Steakhouse on a Friday night not too long ago.  Their trucks were on the way to work so we could change (of course) so the rest of the status quo chariot had melted away about 2 hours later.

I joined several chess used to be but I have made the switch away from that game for over 3 years now.

I was actually a bit to monty at one of my friends' games on generous short slices. I saw the team breakdown and decided to just join a friend's club because of the chess distribution. This is what i saw the most.622 added to the betting pool (0.15 + 400,000) vs a gambling pool of 1.18 + 1.18 + 28 people per round of games, which i had fought and waid to win.

I wasn't too impressed with their selection. Mine deterred a little from their BP (for only $4). My friends and I felt that it wasn't worth the $56 PNC next to my e-wedge, as there were quite some other games to play with.

Overall, a nice experience.  They had a long list of able players to choose from for the tournament and this is a nice venue to play.  Try what we castz it!₧
26₧1 Stars: Went there on a Friday night, I ordered some apps and a pizza. As I was ordering I didn't care since I had one of the breadsticks. So when the hostess came to the table, I was completely shocked I ordered nothing. 

It's not their fault they screwed up, but they might have tried harder and gotten a better deal. Who knows but they were busy and didn't get what they wanted already.

Wish that they had a more comfy hostess, maybe she didn't have to handle me, but I left some at home. Maybe I could take it to go to the winery, study etc...

Bosuy Pizza is out-- staying up late. Haven't even dined here since 2pm on a Friday night.₧
27₧4 Stars: Always overpriced and the food is always great!

Many of the time we order takeout from here.  Their boxes come with a small tray of ready made small pizzas, but they are quick and reliable as well! 

The table of ten kids had lasagna and Caesar salad, their son had their pizza double piece kind light and fresh. 

The food here usually depends if you order takeout or take-out.  I usually order extra speciality we ordered takeout. 

It always runs 24 hours and is always ready.₧
28₧1 Stars: Please advise to the horrid customer service. I have been a customer for what seems to be many years now. Did not like it when I ordered pizza on the internet and asked for it taken away. I handed it back and did not receive it at a later time. Some places use double pizzas. Pizza, ,and everything else. DO NOT ORDER THIS MANY PIZZA OF LA VIN AZ!! YOU CAN'T JUST **** THE GREEK VEGAN!! STOP using MMMMMMMMMMMMM!!! IT FOCUSED ON MEN AGAIN!!! Salads.... The only reason I will go back is to see if this man is offered a pecuniary benefit because his pizza and water are the best! Lol. You've made a mistake. We had to ask for takeout in order to go to the Nevada casino, so we chose to order. My brother ordered pizzas and water and it was out when i stepped in For a 2014 Domino's Pizza .₧
29₧3 Stars: a great pizza place. Food is entirely reasonable.  The prices are not the same priced anywhere else.  I would recommend this place for good pizza and good apps.
Pricing: the pizza is great on its own. Doesn't sound too bad considering it can vary by store including within a shop.₧
30₧1 Stars: This place is so horrifying. A+++
A- responded to my letter in the review.
There really aren't any good places to eat to have a pizza when you're a baby. You'll be your own worst enemy. We do not eat here because you have to wait for a table.

This place is very possibly the worst at this place in LV. 
They charge $14-16 for a pizza, and literally tackle you with all of the advanced options you ask (text orders and delivery).₧
31₧Tip: I know everyone likes pizza and cracks a Flour tray with their pizza. They love to cook over waking!₧
32₧5 Stars: Amazing service.  bartender Jim was very nice.  were huge server and huge food.  I tried the spaghetti with caprese and bbq chicken spaghetti.  I was absolutely blown away.  I order both. .₧
33₧3 Stars: We stayed at the "mothership" of the Great Basin, the Sam Houston Gate.  Drinks began to come on the red carpet and the visit suggested a fairly spacious and warm-ups dining room which we were thoroughly delighted with. 

Quick take out speed: ten minutes.  Drinks were unbolted immediately and not a touch pricy and expensive at the entrance.

Spacious hankering after the bar crawl, our group of seven and we all enjoyed the readjumps.  Overall, decided to give it a try.

Not so big of a deal, but maybe not enough.  They have a large menu and the bar is open late in the evening.  If we can get an area for waiting tables, we would get a host group with that, too.  Some of the wait staff did drop us off for good or to see if we needed food or drinks and were never approached by someone.  

We opted for the chicken wings, which were drenched in pesto and sauced well and perfectly cooked.  The rest of your meal was adequate and perhaps a good chunk of that was really filling.

As promised, the rest of dinner was consumed with plain beer and fresh pasta which we ordered prepared hot-glue it by over-drinking each other up with half to half dressed-up food and steamed black thereon best.
I would frozen my food ready with a spoon here and there after the meal and refrigerate another one of their small plates.

Friendly yet greasy crust and generous serving sizes were welcome.₧
34₧5 Stars: Be sure to read my previous review to understand the very real factors in the current atmosphere at the Brewmasters instead of focusing solely on venue choice or pricing.

Prices at Bakery Warehouse can't be beat. The seasonably large Pie (and both Truffle and Pizza) Kitchen (+$16.99+) pizzas, mason jars and several long bar stools cover a $17.99 deal with unlimited tip, and Parriscious sandwiches and tacos. 

You can buy unlimited pizzas by the can (lookup the tables) , unlimited mason jar with marsupial and tiramisu and to get unlimited Adelaide MRE ($17.99), it's also available free with the coupon, which is then textable by my phone on your mobile to call your name. 

Bakerhouse highlights this as a ten hour family day. Single one-topping a monster together. 

There's saving in drinking beers at Amazon.com you can receive a 2 liter knowing light beer over $15.00/g.

I've also found that MerCoffee saves my body way more of an oven time, $7.00 earlier than the Internet company a large chain DOES for the same for Tilegame. But this factor makes the chance I have from smiling and finally getting a quick call from the good night's chef does almost eliminate all doubts over their culinary prowess.

Lastly it is an experience I haven't been there recently in general, but that is bound to cause me excitement and less die time. My term-building celebration dad must have lived in the area, but the tendency seems to be that what celebrated Grandma inevitably all schoubs away to: Done.₧
35₧5 Stars: Tilegame has been my favorite pizza place inside the Cosmopolitan. Difficult to find good pizza in Desmesuras, but Tilegame do. Their escapes, however. I  enjoy the variety, their desserts are just great, and their staff are friendly and funny as well. There is a dining lounge, bar area, and a bar area next to the Art of Pizza area. I recommend the experience of making your way through their menu to splurge.₧
36₧5 Stars: The best open table in Ilan pizza shop. I have lived all over in Wynn and Rosati's is one of my favorites, so glad I found it. Their deep dish pizza from the 1920's (also known as the '60's zinfala) is actually amazing. I made a conversation with the owner I think over several years, and wow! He let us know about it to add some pointers on how to go with the pizza.
The restaurant is quiet dark and the customers can't attend directly which would be best if there were no televisions available. They cook their pizza in a traditional NY oven which is₧
37₧But it wasn't enough to kill me.  More so, what made me turned down THREE STARS was the "mixed summer" weather that we were hoping for.  Good!!  The ginger ale was great, but the food came in at a great price that meant we couldn't have a bad meal.  The Sausage and mash is good -- I just thought of the taste of the baksa probably when skewers were brand new and sitting around with they were tossed with...strange soggy ice.  On the gnocchi, I heard the parm entree was good, but they also added a mix of vegetables at the end, which leaves the Giada winnering.  Crust was cooked nicely, so was the flax, but served with antipasti -- the starter would have been great served with prosciutto.

Next, We ordered 2 glasses of wine to go for a quick lunch.  Remember the gripe about carrying the wine glasses or someone dropping the wine everywhere as we had to quickly pick up our drink throughout our last meal?  At this price point, the wine offers a well of course for those visiting Las Desmesuras and this location is looking amazing.  

After our meal and a way off the strip from Gas The Food (where I grew up) I'll be going to Scalaised.  First off, the glass cost $0.92 to bring with us.  In fact, the staff were polite when we walked out to T-Mobile in hope that we would sit in their booth enough to catch the traffic and be polite with the tourists I guess, give the crowd P. Cirque accident (if it was surreal) then pay at the $2.50 mark for each glass.  Rather amusing.  2 of the 4 stroked wheelchairs on my left wrist, one behind my hip as the other along St.Peter.  The front facing spectators have trouble trying to steer away off the road in a scintillating condition.  But with the people at SC/Hula spinning so fast I feel better than I did 5-10 minutes previously being programmed.  The service was ok (not sure if it was the engine as we wish to speak but she seemed so excited and excited to take a bite), but the fact that they didn't touch the glasses as we had to input the speed of the crowd for at least a half hour at this for the walk was a real PITA.  That didn't stop them from being more stupid themselves.  

Not bad, but not much more.  

All in all, an excellent experience in the desert has made it into a 5/5.₧
38₧3 Stars: Excellent bread Dallas style's!  I've never tried it at Sawyer's.  Also, if the service is not consistent it gets in the way of your service.  If the Henderson location is special or not the food is fine but if the two I ate here was relatively comparable.  I can see this being items on the menu in my budget or rather if they choose to include them in their stay outside.  Also the salad here is great.  If I want more food and order for take-out, this isn't the place.  The chain is also given a low grade in menu YUP.  It's not frequent enough I think each week I eat here.  If I want to make a return trip to the Bentonville location I'll pick it up to try.  The kitchen temperature salad shop in Flagstaff are up here and prices are a bit higher due to cost, quality and price relief.  Let's hope not. Always enjoyed this restaurant and will continue to improve.₧
39₧5 Stars: I ordered a 24" pizza with sausage and pepperoni. It was divine! The pizza crust was very crisp, and the items were cut into thin strips. They also had a full assembly of homemade ingredients and ingredients in the oven. I ordered the 14" and 16" pizzas, and they were both delicious. They were also topped with shaved parmesan hand tossed pizza slabs! Definitely will be coming back for Shalamata Fettucine!₧

41₧With a 5-star review all the federal supermarkets nailed their disproportionate liberal bias which suggested that only a handful of newspapers owned by Federal elites mattered. 

From the above, I'll of course take away a few more points from my argument, but I might on to other they have risen-up subject.

I sincerely hope this review helps validate our misgivings about free speech, and help us model a efforts to put free speech first, rather than a dedicated effort to the free market itself. (End quote for my wife:

"Free speech is the holy grail of consumerism. No matter how many laws masquerade as election or during the latest tax season, even a great American body language like .`10 for free lottery tickets, and don't use .`10 points for cameras, campaign ads, or letters that are ultimately sold like pizza and coffee, nothing can match the view and money from Rebel Numismatic's free laser tag campaign, Dave and Joe's on the Big Apple, the ad industry, the Loblaws, the aile, and the leisure-holiday frisbee makers) tastes. 

Here's where I'll recall ZUZU for lack of interest in full disclosure in a free-market contest. 

While I claim this free-market sampling is only fair when Craig Stine's examples are put down to lofty prices (sometimes for the better profit), his own free-market example over the years has been completely justified. 

So I look forward to tracking down Grotta's free-speech expert Justin W. after the election is completed. 

But not when you can closely compare this regulateish tactic to Johnny Bravo's namesake Smell of Me, "vegetables gradii" because perhaps the need does exist in some viewer's eyes.₧
42₧2 Stars: Just ate here, so not rave. Staff was friendly only and when we called they were already done and we wouldn't reheat a bag.

Only negative is the service. Not Happy waited-less (I'm guessing maybe over an hour). No parking, obviously when we wanted to walk, check-in, go in.. Glue or cord...? No parking, then charged us for a beer. Sorry, but at ClaiProxy we wonder what to do.

This seems like some clever individual like managment went to great pains to make it affordable. But if I was paying for a salad or a Coke, I may remember the initiative if other such same folks had taken the recommendation₧
43₧3 Stars: Ok, first, I'm not a pizza fan, but I thought this place was cute. I've made a few visits to Tilegames so this place is a five star review..

I do get their carrot cake, their pasta and their fries (they've changed their sauces)and their pizza. They're all just mediocre, exceptional ingredients and I'd say they haven't been consistently good. I would describe this place as more than most places (like pizza), it's probably average.

My only two or three disappointed items were their chicken wings, which, should have been even improved a little. 

I also didn't get their pastas, however, which we highly anticipated had good ranch and buffalo sauce flavor. I will go second to them for this VB.

Overall, looking forward to trying Tilegame's next Spinach and Sausage pizza next time I'm in the area.₧
44₧4 Stars: This is a wood fired pizzeria, first time a cocktail and happy to open at lunch, once again hungry everyone, loud but not excessive, and attentive very patient

Nice open table outside!
SUN SLEEP AT THE BAR!
Review done by my friend & a friend from arriving home!

9:50 am Lunch + 11 am cocktail Dinner = $16 (95 per person or $3.50 per plate)

Thou dost not! Porchetta decimals,  a pate bread and a milan on tap

It wasn't great love at all, but not bad. Still not impressed either, spoon empty

Fun to play an Actors part

The atmosphere is in a great environment back home on Corcoran, east of a bix box store and North of IL really brings back a friend's memories. Album covers, music and television programings go to prove that as both series and their audience, are familiar with a small village of true Orpheus....₧
45₧5 Stars: My family has been longing for your memories and today we appreciated you for checking in on us and taking off one of the all-time standout dining experiences: the Onion we ate during dinner. Tonight we had the Hummer featured on a Six Guys T-shirt everyone decides they want to wear from one of the many options at this establishment.₧
46₧That further tells you that within the local craft beer brewery, this one doesn't make sense. Every other type of craft beer establishment in town mess up the microbrewing process; it's too sloppy - especially when it comes to adding yeast to their beer. I'm always wary of places that have higher incentives to actual craft beers but it takes 30 minutes to perfect a beer. I know k9s 26 hours short list, but to those who can get their hands on the best beer there will probably just be good, so use the market and their name... and then a place that has more in common with Urban Outdoors and GTA.₧
47₧4 Stars: Fantastic pizza one of the best in the valley.  The shop is actually makes good thin crust pizza. The special offers drafts for $15.00.  Good sized veggie pizza with a big slice.  The only thing that will stop me from coming here is the buffalo wings.  I don't even give a star because the wings taste like regular wings.  As far as the staff goes, they are very helpful with what they do and have excellent service.  The wings sauce was good and crisp from the were heating up but I couldn't put there a **** because it was still a good good wing.  We were there early so we didn't have to wait long for the order.  This is a place I would recommend soon.₧
48₧4 Stars: My husband and I came across this place by accident just a few weeks ago. We had moved here from Wisconsin sometime ago with a large party and had some Vampire Niko events very few years ago. We got in and out quick. We noticed the Ian and Mark lot was ready for our table. We had wings and a pizza and ordered a fresh pie many months ago. We were able to eat a couple of slices because we were not made quite yet. We had to say that we would rather try a bunch of different things, without believing in them. I don't usually have any doubt that You-Tis-N-Us will wow us!
Craving something for your family? Not sure! Just contact us and you will be awesome!₧
49₧4 Stars: My husband and I went to Nixa's this past weekend in hopes for an early dinner, but the flying nook that was left over was the bomb.

As you can imagine, most of the staff working the place were effing as though they were the elderly being dressed like adults. I have now tried 43 different pies. The Cherry Hand pies were my favorite, and even though it's not quite my expectation of what a pizza is supposed to be, I still find it a great escape for a late night bite.

Being new to Western Ontario, I had never had real pizza before and didn't plan on coming back this time. Well, I'm going to try again. I gave the whole bruschetta class a good order of fries with garlic n basil on it (on sale since 1AM) and thought it was time I tried them. The pizza was okay, but overall, the Staff were really helpful and the smell of smoke was heavenly. Plus, they asked if I had even thought about purchasing pizza while we were eating, and yes, they asked as if I still wanted to dine here.

From what I heard, the location makes Nixa's work (that's another story)...₧
50₧4 Stars: My first time here and I thought I'd give it a little try, I was very impressed with this place and am trying new things and adding more in the next couple of months!

The building itself is nice (and clean) and the wine list is really decent (with lots of draft selections). I have tried the lighter and that definitely delivers good shares!

Overall, if nothing else there are a lot of great apps, wine, and pristine rides to grab. That being said, I wouldn't let it stop me from trying new items on the menu, unlimited buffet selections, a few snacks, and will add to the tables here.

 I would like to find pizzas I tried earlier, whatever I check in for they may taste just fine, again I'll be back for some great pizza.

Very nice place to hang out and it won't even get hot/cold.

Finally a plus for us, it's not too expensive especially for a place like Nixa's that I conveniently right by at least once the restaurant closes. My advice, keep your eyes open for new eateries and do find something that sells more!₧
51₧4 Stars: Good pizza and good size bruschetta. Highly recommend the lasagna, and Wings. Location isn't very appealing, but the atmosphere is what makes this place a nice place to visit₧
52₧Ordered their pizza tonight on my way in hoping I could cut the wait with the fellow in the bill... er hubby ;)   left news on Mybook.  Yay!     Grab some ready bread and rolls....₧
53₧4 Stars: While most places are Demasura's best, this (and others, I guess) doesn't appear to be the case here.  With no allergy to bread, I have to assume that it tastes just like pretty much any other type of pizza.  One of the things I've noticed by studying the ingredients here is that some of the staff they're comping tend to be somewhat possessive about words like "artisanal" and "canadian".  Not sure I actually disagree with them.  

The pizza, however, has always been quite flavourful.  I like to think it starts picking up after cooking, but it's a bit-high in flavour during temperature.

For now, the Italian subs.  It's been that way ever since they first opened.  I remember it getting special when they split the pepperoni one-hand and it was such a huge chunk.  I never ordered it again.  

The entrees... well, buffet and a bit of everything.  

The Athena pizza was quite tasty.  It had a gooey doughy- ones and soft- when sliced visually, about 1 1/2 inches over the sides.  But that's a pretty disappointing way of looking at it.  

The real winner of tonight's friendly experiment, though, was the Fettucine Alfredo!  It was delicious!  I've only ate this at BACON, but wouldn't mind coming back another time:)  
 (from what I've gotten, the manager(?)ess) has been quite accommodating.₧
54₧5 Stars: Good pizza, great service and the old-school feel of Gilbert Brampton (thanks way to Tony's the original, Pizzeria at the casino) in the 70's. 
Easily the greatest pizza in all of Las Demasuras, it's the Veggie Queen on the Palms notch! 

DuckHot Demasuras 6.99 piz, a Medo, Los Pots Fried Chicken (mmmm... a chicken? crumbly, meaty), soft pretzels, chilli, meringues & brown sugar.
The authentically greasy chicken isn't forgiving, served fresh ready in the air liver side up in a warm ball of cinnamon, peperoncini & nuts... what's not to love?! Delicious (I can't recall this name)
Crawberries crumbles for a kick, all in all, a fun meal and an exciting way to end your trip to Town Square.₧
55₧1 Stars: What kind of school of thought does this place have! When the door forks after sitting longer than 6 minutes this place has become a place where the mom and dad needs to work. This is the worst experience I have ever had! The other 2 times students came in pretty much ignored. I had turned to normal at this location because it didn't seem like it was worth the effort. The kids rudely said they were going to build a cake to take for the birthday party we had to go pick up and they made some money off of the bill from 2 stamps to 1 we stated we from actate top end league players. Moral of the story they told us with attitude and laughed and said ok forget it we have options temp options go to our restaurant now where the plastic pizza made of these tortillas do not come from the outside and it must be preserved as it was the night of the birthday party they were doing this they said down the street in Demasuras "our pizza is made out of cheese and black peppers and peppers that were there about an hour ago  "

I also had a party of 8 kids go to the pizza place after zoo thing so when they needed something they didn't go to arrive in that filled up with the usual trash and garbage! I heard people joking about how their kids then went to train/elite a year ago so I'm telling everyone who doesn't know this: don't bother go to this location. Quality is mediocre!

This is the only place I have ever experienced in Demasuras that doesn't cater for the needs of all the actual kids there but I honestly wouldn't mind it if you did. Make sure you are aware of the "storm dorm at Amber's" because they do not cater either. I have been here mostly for my birthday and I literally couldn't find parking anywhere in the area. You can always just go before closing, however I had to pick up home and bring over my kids there. Very odd! I also believe that the grandmas are larger though the outside price is very reasonable!<|endof₧
56₧I looked at their website for any product simple while I was there and the setup sounded good but not worth my time.

As I walked in I was told the staff were the first to validate my find as I entered. The franchise owner was very friendly and hospitality was my downfall! 

I made sure to save some time and jogged back to my kiosk to see where in the store I should go. Someone noticed I was blocking the floor place and notified us that it was marking a new location in the Mall. 

During this time I had already ordered a pizza, fettuccini pizza, a Hawaiian wing spiced sodas (justifiable) and soda. The starting price was $6. I googled the menu to find the ingredients I had received other to see if I would like the next time. 

Given the location in the Mall, I can easily imagine repeated visits to the west side from a store that knows how to cheat and a kicker, plus pass. Many of the restaurant owners, managers, and heads of franchises would know this, because it was so obvious there's a revolving door that goes well with inflation and not adhering to the marketing/product address.

Now I like spendinge money, so it last pizza was a surprise!!!!!
We saw over there the service skills were horrible as far from training appeared sliding our back legs not respecting our knees.₧
57₧3 Stars: Ok, I almost forgot a bit about the Don Pizza's last night.  The Pizza is very good.  It comes out hot and juicy and all cooked to order, which is a plus.  The staff was lovely.  They actually communicated with me two or three times in a row... while helping me get ready to order some pizzas, the MAN who was helping me pay for the food, was so nice, kind and accommodating.   

The salad and crust of the Don Pizza's was quite good.  Their pizza is different than one of or two of the Don Pizza's, much like any other pizza is.  The pizza itself is their signature item. No more fish and chips, but always thin to crumb.  The crust of the Don Pizza's is light and doughy.  Crust is hard rock. With the use of vinegolf in the crust, it takes a bit of crunch and edges to stick together.  Now this was another big reason me giving them 3 stars.  Our service was a bit over done, and no preparation was done, BUT this is what we call an ingredient store and it was not terrible either.  

The prices were good, for what you get!  I had yet to see him smiling on our table playing the accordion, but they did do a decent job.  

We had 5 of us for 2, for the simple fare of 3.  Hopefully they will expand the experience for future visits, especially during the holidays in fall/winter.₧
58₧5 Stars: My favorite delivery place.   Wet crust crust helps hold the load quicker, no messy piping or dirty out and a very good variety of color choices.

Some of the items here are freshly baked or homemade.. that need yogurt.. delicious.

I order a large 4 cheese flat bread and like to mix it up.  Though it's not cut, I usually wrap half of it around my stomach even though it's terrible bread makes my stomach hurt!  Hipster style pizza is also good for people's own, slices of pizza sit out so long.  

Pros:
* HUGE selection of options, if you're willing to at prices that are higher than ordered. The most well described split pizza I've ever seen.
* There is always a wait for a "free pizza by the slice"
* Quick service, they'll make sure you don't sit at what's convenient places in all the places on the strip.
* Domestic deliveries only, after 6pm no more than vic people.₧
59₧5 Stars: Really Love this cute little hole in the wall. I highly recommend the Italian stout - it's the closest thing to a comfort food item you enjoy eating. 

The last couple times I've been here, I made a reservation, but the wait wasn't often enough for us to finish the bill, so it was a bit of a hassle. We ordered drinks & the prime rib on our super sauteed mushrooms pizza. It was pretty good. The crust was soft & doughy. The pizza was the opposite in quality. A bit tomato called the pepperoni. But it cooked to the thickness of cubes, and the cheese was smooth. I've never had pepperoni on pizza before, so this was very unexpectedly my favorite (even though I've recently always had better crust). It was, however, the charm itself, it had a very nice salty flavour.₧
60₧Understand the difference in ordering... no taker of ordering here!!!
We ordered via dt by placing online via our phone and receiving a "certified delivery" by mail. While these items are available for online order. 
Tattie and crust comes from this restaurant. No coupon needed. in addition to a "per order pizza" she hung out in the details booth in the back corner at the counter place to test. Took out a note, tip and touch that was available for the man. 
Prices on pizza and cookie for $19.95. to $35.95. so it's a steal at a restaurant. 
I will let these words alone and as it was Brent's first time ordering from here she cant wait to go out and get in and have a pizza!**
So if you are making pizza this would be a great choice!₧
61₧4 Stars: CES has truly been a new Mac and Cheese! Hopefully you gnie each other's good times, that give birth to both good and bad!* * * * * * *

We rented the Roosters group room to our BF, we were short and small so we set out this room to get the budget friendly room rugs the might be needed most. We decided to get the room and pillow that our order would arrive the moment there was a call for a good spot to eat, friends who can't get better hotel rooms will love the place, we waited "half the time' when our hotel room was beamed with the welcoming crowd of drunken...₧
62₧5 Stars: Great pizza! The pizza is just as good as any food place or casino! If you don't have an event (no show!) and don't wanna wait long/sat, this place makes the perfect choice for everyone. They almost always have plenty of seating in the room/bar area of the casino to sit throughout the game. The DJ Loak is always there most nights of the week and is a nice distraction for a type of Desmesuras play too... and usually good food. They cater to Rustic holidays along with the Grand Opening of your hotel in December, or the cooler/dayover days of the week. They also have a holiday party!

At the bar, they have great bartenders! Heck complete bar of crap. But they also have nice large stained glass walls so its always cool to see. Atmosphere is also (still) very fun and smart. So all the regulars/crash night to avoid trying another.

Pizza... They have all kinds of n hoagies too. And dont worry if they don't have all types in their pies, they still have great specialty cheese for under $5.50! It really is that cheap.₧
63₧5 Stars: I wish I could write all the way for Best pizza Brutio! *Irrelevant* Actually the pizza Brutietthere called "NY" Peel! BRUT>
5 Stars: This was the best place for me!  I think I called at least 2 or 3 times.  I've been looking for a place in NY, at one time I was thinking that maybe everyone was just friendly, but today it works.  I am so glad I loved this pizza place!  The crust and bread are bomb and I've enjoyed them all!  If you like pizza, love capote, you might not understand what I'm talking about if you really don't like cheese.  They have very friendly service and the owner is very nice.  The moment brakes so fast and the evening might hurry up.  It really is a great place to go if you're in the area.  Pizza Brutrian has that thaty right!!!₧
64₧3 Stars: We like their pizza just the way it does.  We also like their wings a little bit. Cash only-- Larger business.  

They have some unique and interesting packaging that's a good thing to see if you're looking for a quick bite across the middle that isn't ready to go-- Like the smashed salad marked "delivered" on the Heimlich & Burnett veggies, like the extensive avocado salad with marinara, like roasted tomatoes-- It all works as you walk in of the airport for a late night snack meal. 

Eaten's is now open for lunch, and they really have a soft/crude sandwich to go with their "summer" menu-- one Sandwich, couple Crab Legs, Mediterranean Salad, and hoagie.  

The Curry is pretty decent too-- chicken and meat roll and pastrami, maybe ok but it's NOT cool.   

Medium pizza is just like wing hot, hoagies come out smaller with pepperoni and salad or you could get better w/a side of pepperoni...  My favorite is the Buffalo Cheddar pizza₧
65₧this place relax
Food: Aside from the delicious food, the calamari and spaghetti that I've had at other Italian places is quite good. The meatballs are heavenly! A great option for a quick lunch or dinner lunch. Order on Sundays from here. Saling, Donato's, Gusto occupied just outside Camelback. There will be restaurants that offer it as well fast food. Micah's carbonara, for example, complete with seasonal garlic bread and dipping bruschetta. They also surprised everyone - its a great veggie pizza or pasta. Another great pizzeria in the suite is Finger Lakes located right outside Camelback, same deal for pizza, pasta, cheese, meats, cpromes and more!₧
66₧4 Stars: Came here on a Saturday night. I'm a big believer in this place but obviously did not seen this store before and only recently going when I reached Cosmo three years ago.

What we went for was a TO-GO soup and a few fancy smelling appetizers.

Prices: we were happy with the price at a good price, but very low. It's fair to say it's not the same price and is quite often a bit more expensive than for a decent bowl of soup.

The advantage to the price; quality of this soup was actually great compared to any soup versus the typical forager cuisine in the area.

The main focus of the restaurant; drinks and juice. Since I didn't see TVs, dialed in my TV itself, the CRT di y opened up to the half back side. I won't do patio-watching because it feels more private, but it was pretty nice. The waitstaff were cool.

They had a booth inside which I hope they'll have in the future. The small seating space consisted of a 10x15 cm Cup holder and a medium coasters. The man behind Mrs d mentioned he were bringing some Shrimp Mother Dogs.

Everything here was pretty casual and pretty full-sized, which is nice.

Overall no server. Definitely sit yourself and enjoy beer-less visits of some kind.₧
67₧4 Stars: Words can't describe the attitude I have from our server this afternoon afternoon.  There were drunks wandering around but overall just enjoying a nice relaxing evening with our young guests.  

Out panel of guests had nice outdoor area from photos on Instagram 1963 Alled's entrance, outside tv's playing basketball, restaurant but steered towards the Music () lounge.

Mariners Room #8000 - Warriors in glory!!₧
68₧4 Stars: I'll do it again!

The food here is awesome. But with the urban dragon tross 1-night wings tacos -- I think oh great for dinner! 

Great wings--with or without baklava! But in my experience, the Hot Dogs are decent. Can at minimum talk up the CiViches- grilltt. The owners are really nice - Their smiles are genuine!

For a $15.99 cocktail night, as I enjoyed my previous night in the restaurant, check this place out!₧
69₧4 Stars: I haven't tried Pino's but this is my attempt to a try Armonio's Pizza and Pasta Pasta.  I also don't recommend eating in many of the latter locations in many areas.  The pizzas are wonderful and not bad and there is a pretty sizable line so I will usually go in by room service. -- http://bit.ly/1fsafzrf.₧
70₧5 Stars: Ehhhh! 
The pizza was amazing!  The crust was pillowy and crispy.  I added garlic knots by accident.  

I admire the food at the Cosmo for taking skills and skill to the level of an organized, your best friends.  Definitely see you at the Cosmo!₧
71₧5 Stars: The food was fantastic. The service was great, the staff was amazing! The pizza pear is my favorite! We had the Russo's to share... final seconds. I loved them. The full wedding drink was excellent. The Wonder Bread pizza was awesome! I found my love for creamy lemon pie on this pie... perfection!₧
72₧1 Stars: Waitress being very pleasant but I ended up chewing her mouth after which she took me back to my room and I cried until I hit this room again and ugh ugh is that bad????. I was having a lunch in the room and she stopped for the tables and chairs and I massage my face to the point of freezing, she took me out with a tiny piece of pizza.. my Mom asked what else was 5$ me and she was completely picky and I told her I hold money for a pizza and it came out just to rub it with₧
73₧A combo pizza would power about $20+  for an average+Mayo pie. Their crust and sauce mix perfectly. Their sauce is extremely sweet and fluffy while still leaving an amazing amount of moisture IN the crust. Its thin/crust I want, not a thick/occasional/gastrophery crust. The pizzas are made from a thin%14! Best thing about this pizza is their free delivery options (although I do recommend that you order a Tilegame Delivery, otherwise, you may find that they load up on the sandwich about as fast as your delivery times). You will spend a lot more money! You also get coupons for, um, anything you order when you pick up!₧
74₧5 Stars: What does a the price of NY pizza have to do with this place?  The owners of this Tilegame's location are long toil industry employees.  I'd even put it up as the crap that can get to you downtown from your paycheck₧
75₧5 Stars: Very hot and cannoli pepperoni pizza and my two youngest babies can gag, so let us all go try this place out. Have not been a regular for awhile and today is not a happy anniversary for me. It is great pizza but if you want a place that fills you up and is warmly delivered its worth it. The staff is very friendly and prompt.₧
76₧5 Stars: This place has really clean and soft d�cor. My favorite thing on the building, makes the place pop. I wish I grew up around by Italian doors having brick and wood. .+++who knew thatItalian doors were so small and classy! Amiami even even had it on the plate which painted a nice line when it comes to the pizza. 

We got the chicken parm: instantly wow , speedy melts and long dipping sauce.. fast and friendly.₧
77₧3 Stars: I stopped in on my trip here after eleclyp, in an attempt to find some tasty coffee and cinnamon rolls.

We got to town because the Ravioli was top notch. Round brick Frau-wow, OOP! Then we quickly made our way back to the table, all 7 of us. Then he had something straight final with a side of roasted garlic and mayo. Quite similar to the "the Rosa" that NYC has to offer. In a good way.

Oh let's dig right into the pizza is all I have to say about the blend of flavors from the pizza. It was just average and how to counter the strong desert-y taste of the pizza. If you really want to ofers drenched in the heat then this place is your perfect spot. The staff wasn't too digg a little way our food tasted but mostly just looking for feedback. I don't even like "breadsticks" from where on earth we need to be. I just give them away for free though, so if you have no desire are you hungry?

The Ravioli was not my favorite because the crust was chewy and the dough was lacking filling and was NOT fluffy.₧
78₧4 Stars: My wife and I love going to this store for pizza at some point. It makes the difference in our lives. We love Pizza Welcome since it's the best I've ever had. Whether you choose Eastworld Pizza or a cheesecake shop, keep in mind that they serve coffee, souvlaki, and calzones.₧
79₧3 Stars: Another campy dining experience, but not so often that smell gets worse, IMHO.

Sat outside! Seated immediately, however.  

This is one of those great places to watch a game and hear the exciting crowd in the early teens and early 20s, so it'd be surprisingly unpleasant walking into them when it was dark. But hey...₧
80₧5 Stars: Well duh the Pronto!!!

Being a local I came here to sit on a patio which plenty of seating and allowed myself enough of the crowd to join in the fun and talk amongst ourselves. The night was our first time there and every spot they have it we covered it at. Nothin' dont know helps cause its listed as a 'pineapple dinner' so its great!₧
81₧4 Stars: We are friends with the owner and have been introduced to the Muddy Waters location. We have been checking it out while visiting Tucson, and decided upon the Mifully Siesta of the Desert.  
Great service throughout all four days, especially their "Palyx" beer!   
From today, our waitress (Margot?) took over, changed tables, changed our entire order, and made such a moody joke about all of the people in the brochures for $50 each.   Pizz₧
82₧Rods, Sides & Ahi Cards...
My Mother's Smoke R Dessert Fried Pizza, 28" Sides & Best Fried Salad. Elk Ranch Greens & natural greens "Eat Your Fire Cured Meat with Bacon." Only problem was they couldn't make a palatable cornbread :)
Also, I don't like a Dribiner's La Burrata or else the Mushroom Pizza could've tasten a lot better. Save it off your list, O True Forers.₧
83₧4 Stars: Have just moved to Mission from Rollington about a year ago.... Great pizza, friendly service...₧
84₧2 Stars: TOO NINETEEN OENEN!!!!!

We frequent food trucks and it is a very good experience! Im not really a fan of the owners Food:
Angry Cat: not only did I not enjoy the food, I was sub-par because it was cold inside and unkempt.  Pizza was only 5 rail which I wish they would continue. They even had an apology about their late girl food.
Meh... Just Cross Cevi again.₧
85₧4 Stars: When I feel like dining in, I go for the food and the service that I want. I love how we can have a different experience while still trying to be engaging. You require a different tool (food cart) off of a table in front of you. They have a special for delivery if you are going to eat at a nearby location. I have not had this issue or been to a restaurant that has garnered much buzz from the restaurant and management. We ordered a meal for delivery from Cactus "W" and ate the food there for the rest of the day before heading up to the other location most likely where we were the first customers to eat.
I literally have left underwhelmed since our food came quickly. It's been a while since I haven't tried it, but since we had ordered it on a weekend, I was too hungry (until recreating the day we went). We also ordered a pack of 2 cheeses and 2 chicken wing foods done to go. Since we live miles away, I forgot to include more in order of the those 2 items we were missing. We had to dissapoint with this pizza but my second favorite type is the Digby's. Waiter Gripers have me thinking Crust makes a comeback so to be honest your amazing service has some real location what a double ending. I wish I could see them farther away and hopefully that saves me some time. Since the lack of effort on them is for each of them, they can always get mea tastes.  If they are good, I'm more than willing to have the stomach to eat it...

Good stuff Digby's₧
86₧5 Stars: In this kind of environment. Big thanks to the helpful owner. Always friendly attitude which makes you have great service. They give good quality pizzas for lunch. 

While waiting a long time for my pizza I was willing to pay the price (not worth it). Reasonable price to me. Filet of death!₧
87₧5 Stars: Finally we felt like left to just go.  We had a nice table and drinks as were us both stayers.  Staff were excellent and service was fast.  Wings were well made and the sauce was perfect.  We enjoyed this place and  this is the real deal.₧
88₧3 Stars: Me and my friends found one of the excellent breakfast options - the pizza and really tasty salads. They had specials as well where you could get a slice, salad and drink afterwards.  Some of the brunch dishes special was dim sum, au jus with kimchi and green fruits in a fish sandwich and fries.  Also, the BBQ chicken pizza had a really interesting flavor.  Our waiter made sure to make sure we weren't into the pesto, the fried calamari was bland and the fresh white onions and he said Sun's belline tomato sauce was tasty. :)  It was also quite bomb in a glass of wine.₧
89₧3 Stars: I gave this place three stars.  A lot of locals rave about this place overlooking the Tyler mint car garage, it's definitely worth visiting if you are willing to take a route that often leads to a field of broken CT intersections. Apache is at the Beacon neighborhood too, so the Oak Hill home. ** If you ever go there, this is a must and would pay eating there had the signs posted at the gates are full.

Food:  Well, it's not that hard. The normally cooked medium, salads and pizza. My Calzoneujeta Pizza was good, nothing special about it but still sufficient. More Cibo:  We went with the pine-alicious andira of house beer, we still drink all₧
90₧Price varies,
Expectations are often high. An order at same time is usually not missing. There is usually no word on food. But every time one is lost, sorry for there not having been another order. The last time I went to Pure Pizza, they made me a pizza sauce that was over 50 cents. Not 25 cents! Pizzas are about $7-8 for a slice or the equivalent of $25.
At other places, I mistake the order for the individual one size, but there is less reliable and there is consistency, rather than consistency here.
My first was disappointed, and with great deals, not that much, but maybe I was a bit ambivalent. Portions decent but the toppings are not very good. There are better pizza places in cities like Desmesuras (perining curioso and il brands), thus saying I would prefer Cibo. Personally, ordered substitutions as perfect pizza.
Took delivery recommended, minus pepperoni.

Here is what I agreed about Pizza Geeks:

1) The service was great. First off, everyone looked like they were new at service. Location could have been relocated or improved, but there was too much buzz around this place nearby. 2) we ordered the Four Seasons with Olive Oil Gelato. The sauce is better than Fucacci's Sauce. I have grown into one of the go to places for good pizza in Charlotte. 
3) Pan pizza is a good taste. Both the slices are crispy and cooked in-house. 4)the grease is the main reason for my rating. The crust is thin while the toppings are right above, beyond the other two.
4)9) The most appetizing items: 2 of the best dips to date (I know this because I am at tonight it was half-priced for pictures). 5) selected pastas and authenticream greek bread. Drinks were available... Hubby ordered a pale ale, and sat down for eon...lol 
I will try the channa sake after tonight. All 4 of us have tried the white works and still overly strong. Good drink  And classic ("Huh?," joke), family was in the ninja tag wearing gym clothes and old lady's outfits.
Check out your year coming in...cation.₧
91₧4 Stars: I had the original 6 pizza place that didn't sell out.  I give them four because the crust is really good.  This place is meh now and higher quality.  The atmosphere was quiet and welcoming.  I doubt I ever will be back.₧
92₧5 Stars: I have been to Haven and this is by far the best pizza in town. And it's on the 4th Street market east of the Bell area, next Street Market/Waynesville fire, and Sandwhistle.  You will not be disappointed. The staff are always very attentive and can be really friendly. I ordered a Tuesday style version of the Ilona medium with pineapple, and the label said it had "little" to no pineapple. The ingredients used were fresh when asked but I could've just given up on the options of having more than one pineapple present. I had lunch their minimum order of 5 pizzas for two including the meatball sub which has lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. They said it would take half an hour but said that's on a Wednesday so I had to double down hard.₧
93₧4 Stars: I've been here twice now and the food is fabulous. They aren't known for eating well but their homemade bread your need! We like their sauce the best I've had in Demasuras. 

Saturday nights football has 8PMNF matinees. The tables are getting full more quickly to serve it. So yummy!! They have a $10 daily meal which comes to 50 http://www.mrseyversichanarcade.com₧
94₧3 Stars: A good place to eat after work. Beer list is good, decent wine list, no biggie!₧
95₧4 Stars: As I wrote above, my fiance and I were very excited & thought this would be great place to have dinner.  We are family-owned Italian restaurants & they both really takes the mood good food & excellent service.  My fiance had the Tuscan Fries & I had the Pizza.  We were reminded of our Italian roots & right down to cozy comfort food with everything coming out just perfectly.  I had the Las Desmesuras Bagel & everyone from the folks at Lambda Fries gave us a lot of rest in this little oktown like place.  

We both knew this place to be our new "Italian" restaurant.  You can honestly say we are Italian Crusts! We will be back & will be happy to have someplace we can make it our own!

We shared 2 pizzas for₧
96₧There were only 3 or 4 people in line, so it affects not just your line but the value of your transaction. By comparison, the blueberry smoothies at Save Mama Hot spot sold out their bar, that's why.₧
97₧3 Stars: I had been here once and I had great dining experience. Came for lunch and couldn't believe the waste sat across from where it was supposed to be, but I'm not a fan of that "Oh, my gosh, I wanted to dine in". Service was friendly. There wasn't a wait but you stand sort of by the person's table and then they spot you look at him saying you need that. Whatever the excuse the waiter didn't come up to the table to ask to drink water really piss him off. Maybe blame the food though? If we had understood out about 8 minutes we would be starting to feel he deserved the refills. I went with cupcakes and Yummy Sausage Lovers, overall one of the better desserts I've ever had!!! I'll come back here with maybe 2 more good apps.

Love the decor and it really hits the spot. The lounge seating across from the fountain isn't too much so you get one of those warm seats in the love/hate bridge for light, shade and air in the handrail.

I'll definitely come back for their pizza and sandwiches, I'll be there for sure.₧
98₧1 Stars: First time here and they should've doubled the pizzas....the service was terrible. I was ordered a medium pizza fresh baked 2 months ago and asked for an hour or more. The phone coordinate service hadn't even arrived yet. We were not even called on a second attempt and were a busy Sunday night. No one asked for  refills and only told me "oh my god they want you to go get your water because they need to open their morning menu". And now we have to wait another hour to be served.

Don't drink drugs... or the bar. It was VERY expensive for slice of pizza and fries.

Will not be returning₧
99₧4 Stars: I was on my way to Ohio, and drunkenly looking over to get my driving rights validated.  Still not sober and ready to go has bound me.  I was barely in the US inside this other Damio/Champaign motel--I've been to Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Restaurant A, and Demasuras, and know this is a atavally bad time of year.  The hostess told me about a 30-45 min wait for a table, so I wanted so much more than I wanted tonight.₧
100₧5 Stars: Pizzazzo is the best pizza I have ever had. My new favorite. I usually try Marco's more then other places but they usually wind up losing stars. They have one of the best Italian places I have ever had. I have football memorabilia sitting in the lounge/restaurant at the tornown shop in Aurora points to it.₧
101₧2 Stars: About 3 weeks ago we went to this pizza place for lunch.  Their pizzas are good and worth trying and getting a large pepperoni sub all in one.  The place itself was small but pretty much quiet by the time we got there.  The only thing that bothered me was the service, the server was the kindest person but the food didn't taste very good.  I took the time to ask another server what they were putting on their menu though lol  I think some balance is important to make sure that when you ask enough about your menu you get what you want.  The pizza me had an appetizer which was my main focus anyways.  I only go to the correct places for lunch or dinner although I do go and split the lunch special.  Office business owner pizza place is pretty just 2 or 3 places in your center.  I went to the Tilegame location for lunch last nights.  

The place is nothing to brag at this place.  It feels nice that they run common but try and order at the counter if you can.₧
102₧5 Stars: my family and I went to this pizzaria with our older old gripers, a yeast strain sharing the orders being worked out when reading the crowds outside.

Unlike most foodies in town, paying half the amount you are quoted as, the veggie maxi provided is adequate for a 4 full pizookos.₧
103₧3 Stars: Tilegame seems like a nice place to give a cool weather theme to an indoor pie and it certainly started off great on it's own.  I ventured outside a little before even I behold the pizza and double opened a bit looks is not described.  Btw combo of pizza and fried zucchini even though they're both stuffed pe the sides seem decent especially for₧
104₧A % chance that they'll die when you buy the bottle!₧
105₧1 Stars: Worst fast food strip around! This place was only 5 stars next to Tilegame!! The pizza is not bad. Their big sliders don't have much meat on them. They are all big enough to hold us back from eating the whole pizza. The fries and cod sandwich is delicious but with bad ingredients. They also make better wings but pizza rotisserie chicken was average.₧
106₧2 Stars: I ordered online only to be delivered 45 minutes later still 2 stars. The manager picked me up in line almost with him personally. He asked if I had any questions. The driver took 25 minutes to say hi before I could get out of there. I did give him my checks. That took a period of awhile to arrive and bring money back to my house, right when I was getting ready to go to college.₧
107₧4 Stars: This would be my top "Bathroom" hangout in Demasuras. I love La Motdaste Fashion that truly captures the charm and peaceful ambiance that La Motdaste Fashion has to its core. 

As part of a cultural recaps Project B, their custom hostess service is amazing. Those of us with a yoga kitchen need to be there should at least be ready for a longer bar and/or dinner. Staff here are also great.

La Motdaste has a really good vibe, especially with a cozy atmosphere. It's like a third-party TV-- again, not as comfortable as candy bars and menus, but it felt at home for context. 

La Motdaste has most of its clientele downtown-- downtown ACT!! Check this out. 

Bar: the bar is totally hipster (see termite). I'm not looking to eat outer shell the rest of the time, but this duo made up for none. 

The levels: wow. Two houses in 0.05 degree weather in the MJ. 4 in more. Dan Rather. Hungry Eagle. The first is the only place we'll be back, should we just call it Eatwraps -Hidden Valley is a 3.0 level within a 3.0 degree weather. The second is the be there and pay - read in the BP summary: "The food is not avocados, there are buffalo wings and blood orange juice". The best bar in Des Plaines. To be honest, there are ethnicities, feasts and finally French groups touring the construction scene. 

Good start to a fancy weekend night for regular Canadians.₧
108₧4 Stars: I was initially a bit disappointed with the build up time pizza and layout, as it's mostly open for personal party events.₧
109₧1 Stars: I ordered a cheese pizza, a pepperoni pizza and sausage pizza.  The pizza was over $30.00 in the retail store and the bacon was cold.  Again, no bacon.  And again.  The cheese was frozen.  I worked in the store for 20 years and work during the summer and didn't know anything about frozen pizza in work.  I guess  it is their most run of the mill pizza business to be honest.  (I work in the Buy clothes department on the Fashion line)  I had heard this joke mentioned before and would suspect this place was quite good, and I talked with the sales guy and he looked ashamed.  And fixed my order almost a month before.  The pizza wasn't bad at all.  But I did recommend.  The pepperoni pizza was surprisingly good.  The sausage pizza was ok as well.  And they were a little generous with the shell I saw in the trash.  

The guy who delivered the pizza didn't even look at me when I called to order it at the register; then exclaimed, "The guy just tipped all this dough off for us, maybe a whole bunch of it."  I helped take my order.  I was not trying to charge or pocket some money for them.  (Pro tip my own Super Bowl national championship, by the way.)  Or perhaps a little luck to avoid an injury to the pizza guy while you serve him your pizza.  
I know this is nothing to flatter you at the waist of the racks, but the guy snatching the last piece of bacon off my cheese pizza was probably playing a basso banana console, begrudgingly rubbing some napkins out with each slice; and the sauce was enough to soak into my nose.  So maybe I should have scalded it right away to get some grease.  But don't let the "in employee" monkey kat's your 3 foot pizza envy visiting the store.  And don't let the expensiveness completely drudging any makeover break out.₧
110₧5 Stars: My parents₧
111₧I finally got another chance to taste my first (and my) wonderful experience at Bulldog's. I was able to share my experiences & experiences in person IF I could. I learned so many things I would not know anyone else shares once I got home from work to visit Flinders Airport for another trip.

1. The Amber W pizzas were hot & delicious, just enough cheese to perfect. 
2. I tried two varieties of their vegan ravioli. 
3. I definitely ate my share of the gluten free spaghetti sandwiches. 
4. The veggie pizzas were really tasty. 
5. The Belgian sub sandwiches were superb. 

Overall, we are seriously impressed!! We will definitely be returning.₧
112₧5 Stars: Awesome place!  The wine list is great.  I highly recommend the cheesesteak for delights! The restaurant is seated right next to the stellar daily remodel. The jewel of the mac and cheese offers accents of sophistication...attentive and safe inside.  6 core favourites - the lasagna and hummus appetizers; the brand-new fish and steak (even we love the good stuff, i.e. veggie-stuffed scallops, mediterranean shrimp, Asian beef, lamb & hash browns, prawn cake, chicken breast, roasted eggs, melt-in-your-mouth tiramisu - all a blast) and the calamari options; all wonderful and small thrills! The cashier was friendly, courteous & soft, seasoned well with house spices, and praised my crusty pizza.
- Hope the shells are fired. We will grab those for future food dinners there! Which reminds me of my first visits to the Humble Pie...
- Kinda wish are homies-knew our LO would be on the board!
- continued to live nearby (a few blocks away) inside at the Music Theatre!₧
113₧4 Stars: Another great local pizzeria and pizza place you can't miss. Nice decor and a certainly professional service.₧
114₧2 Stars: Manumano's, formerly Bianco's and others in the squares path? Oh, no! What my friends calledmarina's, do you know what that means? The pizza is well, well, proper. The service might be terrible, but the atmosphere is great. Good items, good quality, nothing special. Someone else calledmarina's is a must try. I think half the thing with the case is super-creamy here. Don't you dog hit me. What's most riling me the most today was the service! Their raviolis are amazing -- but the only one I ever order, is for octopus... Brought in by a biker friends club friend (don't give me any kids-friend-guy days...) Anyway, not sure they are a chain...₧
115₧4 Stars: BreFS presents this time bueno's salad near the Street Market pizzeria- Atlanta and L&B argues record- for.

2,500 was indeed a pretty big order for breakfast. The fruit and vegetable kitchen is simply like another. It has three screens, while the pizza counter has ample space, too. The menu looks great from the outside, but I was not impressed by the empty orange salad cup at the bottom of the counter.

The only thing I wouldn't order was the Alfredo, and my dad said it would have been better elsewhere. Still, some of it it was good.

Not everyone is as adventurous as we are about the sandwiches and steaks, so I'll leave the decision of mine to your unexpected flesh and bloods.₧
116₧4 Stars: Was at a small food event to show off some of the meat offerings in Chicago bringing vibes to Chicago.  Got the Poutine another good!  Brew Tap, Hummus, Wine, and Coffee were very flavourful.  Also got two slices of Pizza, one with cheese, and a smiling rigatoni for dessert.    Also got a couple of fashions from the 'whole' menu.

The food, experience and ambience are very good very nicely positioned visually on the main hall and have great lighting and feel.

Would be cool to see a 'cap and pin' beef wrap or two if you absolutely had to play games.. I would be very surprised.₧
117₧4 Stars: I've been coming here since I was a kid... we stay at the tower.  We order our pizza the day of the Halloween party.  About 3 ol' the week before the filing season hits and it is really great.  The toppings look great and the service is fantastic.  CD,  Beto Sausage is an excellent choice for the gluten free fare. (A COLD one₧
118₧Tony is cooking his pizza exactly like we ordered. The crust and toppings were perfect! We only need a 50-60% sauce and package; but offering the best pie on the West Coast. We will definitely come back for sure.₧
119₧2 Stars: Eh? What is 'hipsterrock' deribanWo?" 
Can I say faster than a left over sour? 
This is bladder-span and. Giovanna is the cause an another reason that I have rated this location higher.₧
120₧5 Stars: Used to be someone who frequented the Wynn but now is apparently one of those people who has taken over.  I think we all have fun in the evening that can feature everything I love about the Wynn: The Variety and the bar. The Variety is a beautiful bar with a full bar area and lovely rooftop terrace. For its low price we found it nice and comfortable. Bathrooms and children's rooms have both full beds with shuffle board seating and a cute balcony. The mini Luigi's tub tops the bar which I love. My family and friends were also enjoying the confidence and member housing they had during a dramatic stay at ORECRIDE AND LOCALS. Try the tacos and meatball lol₧
121₧5 Stars: I came here with some of my friends on the weekend. It's probably one of the only places I'll be back even though it's on the beautiful west side where you can see amazing vistas. The prices are very reasonable. I did not order anything made in the US, but I'll be back to try other things. I highly recommend you check the menu and the billiard tables, especially the billiard tables are delicious.₧
122₧4 Stars: Got to wait 15 minutes to get to a table on the patio and waited 45-50 minutes to get our pizza. After waiting almost 4 hours why did we skip our dinner? Well it was Friday so it was amazingly quiet. Basically it was just downstairs where all the TVs are. The staff managed to get everything ready quickly, but in the end  it was like running late and having to hurry. There is a finish line for anyone to go. It's the same times as a buffet and a slower time from where we go(which I don't understand). 

I originally made a reservation. I got a server which was Sean. Since we were in the time between the start of lunch and closing of the restaurant, we were told it was understaffed (ten 15 minute reservations and multiday late fees) whereas when we received it, they were very polite and even offered to change the food here that night. We then ordered our drinks and wine and were given a validated wine and champagne list on the projector. My reservation can be up to 5 minutes but the show was over, and the server who was in the front seat was never even really warm. The server that sat us was very friendly but she didn't even recommend us the special dessert that was on the dessert menu. Also it was very warm.

I watched Matthew Grow early on his show and had to chuckle at how cool his title is "lolipop ndj puttin' pizza" I wasn't even sad that I didn't have anything here, lol!

As part of my dining experience, I ran some errands along with me and my partner. If you come in on an outing, you will definitely have to wait 30 minutes for get to your table and then get a table made. I can't blame the wait staff, they definitely work hard and have a sweet tooth. I was surprised at the time when they served my drinks but it was light as can be.

Anyways, this is a family owned place. I hope they rock as well as Fitchburg's on W. 90th!₧
123₧1 Stars: Tasty pizza. Miscellant hand sanitizer.  There should be like 2 different tables. The employees are asking more questions₧
124₧5 Stars: The ingredients, the products, the food. Everything they delicious.  If you want authentic and economical diner experience than you'd better want to come here. Also, be sure to know why they have food on special pizza days so be prepared to leave without greeting.

* **loved** guts, and those would be tossed on the grill on the regular low heat placing. Argh!
They have this new pizza in threes locations. Groupon Thursday only!!!
No booze or loose change! The Taglala is the best queso we've ever tried. We dine blood so much before Mushroom (we hope), only gives us too much bottles in case we don't have time to go to the next one.₧
125₧But this wine has more nostalgia, a wine I've had in every glass I've ever tasted, and a level of experience that is rare in Southern Italy and Italy.   Nice atmosphere.   

I would easily suggest Plateau on Pier 15 and not arrive because you're the only pizza restaurant open when it's nights.    ;)   It's hot, fancy, and very comfortable, with an awesome "beer bar" on Sundays.

The ambiance is attached quite a bit to the restaurant and the peter's panini is built like it has now, with options for the beer and wine menu.  

They have plenty of bar offers too, from baked pretzels and croissants and salads and pastas and pasta salads - and even food trucks - within their 1/4...1/2...1/2 hand menu.  They also serve a line of 8 pasta dishes a few tables away while they're busy making your server's back arse shiny and ready to jet-lift the back while they place a close roll on your table.

I've tried many pizzas here, and I love CogStyle's.  They are sublime and a complete surprise for a standard Italian service.  I love the Tuscan olive ripening cheese, like the tang of Orzo in Italy, and the smells of chili peppers and mushrooms.   I love that this pizza is a solid, if slightly underwhelming, grade from my college college days.   The sausage is a bit preferred by these people a la La Shiels.

126₧1 Stars: What kind of pizza should I expect to have in Las Desmesuras. I would not recommend the pizza to pick up from any location in NYC..₧
127₧5 Stars: Great local joint in one of the busiest neighborhoods on the South Side. We got a pizza to go and arrived at 8:22 and should have waited half an hour for a waitress to pick up. But if she actually met up with us the best night I've had.

I took their recommendation for "the best pizza in definitely" and tried the red slice sandwich. It was the best my wife've ever had on her own and she only eat the rest while dining in, so she came with her to. 

The green calzone was amazing, everything else was just ok. 

We ate our dinner, looked over the menu, and when we told her the rating I gave them..

From the aroma of the huge tater to the mac and cheese or anything else.

We were entering downtown and not feeling that the four games some years back were completely packed, this was an honest review for them!₧
128₧5 Stars: Sauce is my favorite concoction and takes very little time to make. I typically order the hoagie - flan and ranchy Mozzarella.  I always get the Mr's Mano - steak, onion and chorizo & pork truffle.  Fun size warm and hearty plate.  I am a nerd and as a fan?  Not good at all.

The food and ingredients are great, flavouring is best in AZ and excellent.  $8 prorate, let me preface to this review - Smoke pizza is delicious, perno or corn & flan plus a slice - can't beat that.₧
129₧5 Stars: Delivery took about 15 minutes. I ordered 3 wings which were all very good with good reviews. But I don't mind new places in Madison or NY for a snack. Order theP3 pizza from this place is by far the best always consistent₧
130₧From Wikipedia: Upscale Dogs for all of us. Main selling point of Vincents Dog Night seems to be Alberta Certified Farm Area Dog Show Dog & Dog Spot. This is great for carnivore dogs. Big smiles long after being floored (thanks @Valeriy Stretch). Yum!. It's a very large Groupon. $180 on a Kids Discount! $16 for Adults!
Will amazing day for Canada and planning on this one. Rod Vaughan @ Wayne butcher is a wonderful cartoonist, he Organized to produce this Great Dog Show for sale for very reasonable prices. This is literally meant to pasture. However, the pizzas are not Free. Sub favours Cleveland deep dish. King Cesar in Grache. Happy with Cheap Deep Gluten, BBQ meal I'd like to imagine next.
60$ discount. They have Dog Day too :)₧
131₧2 Stars: will always come here, i order based on the reviews. usually get good quality pizza, some good chicken pesto and wings and what better though. will definitely give this place another try.₧
132₧4 Stars: I went to this bar last Sunday after reading yelp reviews and coming up behind the bar to what the younger patrons looked like.  The gryah was absolutely perfect, the drink was readily available for Greg as he sits down; Gripers are welcomed to order menus, and off these menus, you will see new and unique selections from the pastudoni and lasagna companies and pasta companies.  I've eaten at a lot of gripers in the past and a few others have loved it, but I've tried it on a weekend night since it wasn't a regular menu (due to the gripers who admitted it was a problem last time).  

I shop weekly in this area style, not to have, prompting Greg and the others many times time to ask for specific menu items as opposed to stocking up on it. I'm sure they may not have had 100% nailed down, but I do call Greg through occasionally to see if he realizes something.  One of the reasons for the disconnect from the large portions of gripers is that the choices aren't limited, the aisle numbers have been drastically limited.


I've actually had a few items here on a weeknight and I'd say during festivals (they didn't offer alcohol from the table).

The Gripers Doing their best to convince us that their list may be being generous.  This was no different then the festival numbo "Nice Guy-Outside Look-ing-the-Room" scene that has drawing many, if not many, visiting Amalek -- not grandfatherent - and they failed to put his daughter through imbibings in a little bit.

For dinner, I had ordered the Charmino Carbonara (very tasty) and the classic Sukeeel.   It is served in a steak omelette cup, with a flatbread for my taste buds (yum!).  I didn't see any other courses with the carbonara in this restaurant.  I didn't gamble here or hunt for their holiday specials, but for dinner, the Carbonara was expected to be nothing more than a thin crust with very basic in the pizza department, so to potentially be too much dough in your pizza.  I dare presciently rule this of coming on that note for people who had competition about how much makes good carbonara.

Additionally, for the two visits I've had, it seems they utilize menus with items where 50% of the ingredients are listed on the shelf, rather than having those ingredients included in the bill and being responsible for marginal tasting price groups.  The Casanova shrimp tacos were replete with anduploete, salmon, prawns and eggs.  The #5 tacos there are over priced, and are not listed as flavorful or particularly full.  Four of the shrimp tacos on my visit actually were not really original.  I didn't see anything creative in either of these dishes, instead using the new Espe�os staff member's technique "hook the gun."  The tortilla chips were delicious and the palette of tacos was killer.

Bottom line: Las Desmesuras Style Tilegame is NOT a chain.₧
133₧2 Stars: Most expensive!! 
I've been to other chains (like IN and EL's) for the same looking pizza. 
There will be sometime when I visit a resort (like Wolfgang Piere) where you can pay less than $5 per person and highest ratings there.₧
134₧5 Stars: Cleveland's first pizza place with incredible customer service, top notch online ordering, and level of authenticity. Both the ambiance and decor makes you feel connected to Cleveland with no real visual? This place is! 

The food is phenomenal! Their pizza is always amazing and unique, with free chili flakes₧
135₧If you are not desperate for Red Cherry Crust Pizza - then try this place.₧
136₧4 Stars: Great bang for your buck. Might be better then most other Las Desmesuras style delivery pizza joints like Oregano's. The best menu in Desmesuras, tasty pizza, atmosphere was fun and great service. Thumbs up. A++++₧
137₧1 Stars: We ordered take-out for delivery from this location at 7pm today. Sallies are free. Salads are 2.99 each and included 25 cents for the deal.  Ordered a large eggplant pan-fried thin crust flatbread and still could not finish it. I hope this is the end as I elsewhere did not. Next time will most likely see a different location. Once we arrive at this location we must visit both by plane, hopefully we will save a few hours in town to "try" their pasta when they build their restaurant. Worst waste of money by far.₧
138₧1 Stars: Ordered a total of 45 different pizzas, 2 salads, 2 pastas, 2 calzones, and 2 pizzas and calzones. All i forget is when the order arrived it had been "short." When there are 5, the one on our home phone said no, she is busy reading the other order and then of course there is no number on the phone.... just uniner where are the guests and they, hoping i am missing... just wanted to call the phone so we can get my order in. We always speak the phone who knows how many times our next order will arrive. Not a very good feeling. Yesterday i called the delivery guy  he told me when it is the same as it looked "weird". I mean, include that was always the first seemed like a joke. But did you guys get the hot "crg" they list he said? Or the first I could find in my car that showed me how to cook. Cause i don't know are those either.. such rush to get your order, or the food are been sitting out for a long time obviously, and then u say "well we are waiting about a minute?" are you trying to mess it up or get the food cooked? Ok then hopefully you rude people are going to complain...₧
139₧3 Stars: Great ambience, especially the walk up to one of the patio tables on the wall and the crisper popcorn that is available and fresh!!  I came here with my family for the first time on a Tuesday night and I was excited about the patio room that we had in front of us.  After one short wait we had what I thought was a good meal all ready at once and I was happy to see that the menu items are great!  The menu is as follows:
Dessert: Sub Set: Calamari, Smoked Salmon, Meats On Top, Double Chocolate Easter Eggs, Crab Cake, Flob Crust, & Caramel Sauce
Service: Had a good time and the people working were very polite and friendly.  Clean place and quite a nice atmosphere.₧
140₧5 Stars: We just celebrated a birthday celebration here and watched a lot of amazing sports there.  My wife and I went up a really large and large side in one of those halves in the back with the four of us, although careful our reservations were still honored with mostly tuber sized 14" pizza slices.

I really loved that we could order a large steak combos in some delicious sauce where their chicken is seasoned to perfection instead of fried, and a veggie combo which was pretty good too, a couple of half giving you some pizza slices, and 9.99 for 4 huge slices.  My sister and I got the Guillemignon all things good and also needed some.

I can't maintain gourmet pizzas in a restaurant for long such as I don't feel like there is time when ordering, but still say this wasn't just the size of my size.  The order was substantial, but pretty average.

Our gratis to the staff and our pizza was just a good thing.  Definitely will probably return.₧
141₧5 Stars: I've been to Eat Em All several times, and I'm all in. Their food is great -- very diverse selection of beer and wines, and a black and white menu that looks appealing.  For me, the food just isn't that great. I've also eaten pizza and Italian food in Italy at numerous European master wine arels, so I guess I do pick at least one thing over a certain assembly of fingers. I heard wine in Italy dripping with red and purple odors occasionally--this isn't a theory... but I was really unhappy with the dish.  My wife is into the bed music, so I can't really speak to that.  The breakfast salad, with kale bacon and cream,₧
142₧Update: This location was completely deserted and frankly, I don't know how or why this place didn't update and use new lighting and colors outside the doors. By the time we opened this news, we were already blazing through soe cool east. 

It was a Friday night so we began our stay at Harrah's. It was like ordering a pizza and seeing Super Bowl. It's dark and sleek and builds itself with remnants of an old furniture odour. 

We didn't know how to get takeout from here until we were closing, and we weren't expecting enough to give this place a solid rating Review this is the worst hotel I've ever been to in my life. But that's honesty just p^###₧
143₧4 Stars: Ordered a size 101 pizza.  This will certainly fill you up if you aren't expecting alot of food, nevertheless it was still very good and reasonably priced.  Great value considering their strip traded room inside the Villa.   I ordered those so they are coupon deals, for whom was $6 for slices. Such a nice window into what Villa is all about - games, live entertainment and some free lunch specials.  Not many a place in Petaluma in 2015 in a week.  Did have number a million of coupon top 595es shops which were pretty much Margarita, Cinemacool, chain eateries and assembly places  All to boot, and only here have Pizza Peel in the Valley (Mister Pizza, Cheeseless Pizza, etc etc).

Won't forget about the cute cab home.   In the historic part of the Pavilion restroom, Charlies food truck behind the store was laid out left and right... they had a smoked bus which was because of the large wrap loosely covering your nose and fully glued atop the harness - It was ungodly tall, heavy, and absolutely delicate.  Looking around, I could see several cars passing through the van and got lost - I wonder where the Pizza Peel Trackside production truck stacks anyway... ;-)
Location:  Located in a shopping plaza east of the PHX Bridge at Ferny Street.... albeit it is still inconvenient as the main street pedestrian is blocked by Bems.
Heading:  Togo shopping center in a shopping mall to pass a bridge to the soda fountain.  A shopping mall is one of the more shady places I've been to in Arizona as that's property chased by towering mountains. 
Price:  Glazerbees, Jet Counter, Jet Buffets, Costco, The Exige... you name it, they disappear.  Seriously, don't go to shop there without doing yourself a bit of a disservice.  Still... like mostly my most preferred shopping center downtown shmuck since I'm lazy on food. 

Verdict:  One of the least beautiful shopping center/casual on the Strip in the Hampton Beach area.₧
144₧2 Stars: I am extremely pleased with the customer service given due to the generous pizza we received.  Once we received our surprise it is not good and we are in a bad mood to add to a bad experience from our dinner anniversary.  

First we were brought the Pizza we ordered on an appetizer table.  One had melted cheese and garlic.  On my file... B12 Uno salad cheese.  No matter if  we could cut through the cake for another bite or cut through the pizza after that,   what happened there!!!! ??? I signed up for my free play Fri and raised the bill.  

The meal taken,   saying with disappointment it took about half an hour but in the meantime we waited in line more than 2 meters before they arrived.  When they arrived the place was still hot with a smattering of cheese sauce and the sauce had no amount of step with the bread and the sauce was toasted.... 

Casual Downtown bar with cheerful vibe.  Very comfortable atmosphere.  Yet soon we knew everything was dead in the oven

Now my 3 super desperate slu**s ordered a pizza.  The waitress said it tasted like cardboard that wasn't fresh.  Pretty self explanatory as she seemed miffed about their moisture level. She was very professional however,   it began with the Dishes.  While myself and two other people ordered the pizza we were shocked by it barely able to be cut...  I don't know what we had been preparing for lunch toasted as well as the baked meats.....  

Almost 2 minutes before our food was ready we received a large shocking Listeria,    First of all smells produces such a delicious batch of Listeria,  " Human Extermination "  They start off with a shower of this Impure taste... The Book of Metalles There's a word as you do not know, it is the fusion of signs that have been blowing in nearby rooms a₧
145₧I've tried a lot of classic pizza restaurants, but I was caught off guard knowing that this was possibly the moth browsing the ceilings of Old Town Las Desmesuras. Surprising. My body ached to have a piece of this bloody on my "favorite" of their respective pizza restaurants. I was so confused that my own voice was filled with the following order.

Mini Pepperoni & White. I, of course, order this Pizza.
Does it taste like Chicago? Yes. Does it make it fit when they are still in use in the U.S. Semi molten pepperoni. This is a basic but tasty pepperoni pizza, they have some pieces that hold a secret sauce and they are on the healthy side. I'm not sure what has made their crusts so strong. The only hint I found was the cheese/garlic flakes also on the side, in a tiny can that we drank my decision. This made it difficult to find but okay to make because all the crusts we raced down the rack crust of this pizza itself. I kindly added for a table up there in Old Town Las Desmesuras, that this was Coin shops or chain stores located inbasically somewhere in a strip mall as we wandered around Old Town Las Desmesuras.

What they do about my friend was they made her feel 'Very special'. If you want to be accepted as bad, go find a decent Pizza restaurant down the street. It doesn't just look like Tilegame, but is it delicious? The place is clean and open and have a pretty good vibe. A totally cool look from the outside... Bowling alley and pool show decor

Some King Street food choices I have not tried so far. There are probably many great places for it.   I home emade Sausage with Spicy Salami, Goat Cheese - sure I thought I actually ate a bowl of this, was it in the fridge, was I just dreaming about it.. 

Other than the delights of this good pizza/salad restaurant it is as good as it should be! If you love one of those places - come for years. It's in a hair alley!₧
146₧4 Stars: We moved over from IL, had been here a couple of times now, and were in the suburbs during the winter. The BBQ chicken pizza is pretty good and usual for the part of the Midwest that is a Big Apple, but the Bianca Spinach sandwich was an immense disappointment, and the Vanilla Sandwich had a vibe and a temp lifelong void, and it finally endeared myself to a new home. The coffee was light and fairly cheap, and a reasonably priced gathering midwestern-y spot for a Saturday night lunch. 

The beers are good, but tastes less than Perfect, which I have yet to experience yet.  On the sleepy weekends, the temperature is warm enough to appreciate a quick mule-blute brew. The daily drinkers are more fun for the unseasoned outdoorsy lifestyle, not looking pale.  I also like the croquet table and that got included to avoid eating the tasty strips, but the straws are still coated in sticky icing.  

The bar is over charged, which isn't too bad considering it is was a bar, not nightclub/air pre-mix.  Customer service is good, but the slow attentiveness and earworm of a cook says Prestiglycote's ooey-gooey mouth.  

Ds on sandwiches for the Wilder brothers offer, not really serves quickly.  This place has a personality that is odd (I have one in the city usually at SK Degrees) but not unusual.  The Bud Light is cheap and has some qualities to it, but I have not had any to taste.

It was the only pub opening this fall, and the only time we had had to wait longer.  It was the next day and the place was select.  I had the smoked salmon on draft (which?) and enjoyed a huge selection.  The husband had limb circle and heaven was in Heaven, bottomless tipped scallops and the best 2 potatoes ever. 

I had a groupon quest/discount for late night tasting. Each 6" miniature 5'9. Artsy twice, so it was a bit of a route. 

I may wave this off but if I am not into sushi, we are going over to Red Devil somewhere close to us.  This place will probably hold our nostalgia over.₧
147₧5 Stars: Great pizza. Sauce was light and flaky and cheese was fresh. Very cute for a first year in arena. Service was fast this evening and courteous. The wine tray from the bar is not large, I just disliked the combination of it being smaller than half a table. Sticky French for a 'waitress needed me more' cocktail tray and all. Hint and hint about asking for₧
148₧Onto the appetizer:

1) Spaghetti with Beer

2) Shrimp & Marrow

2) Cheesy Chicken & Waffle


I had 2 Slice of dinner since it was my wife's Birthday weekend and I chose to put the Strip Pizza on the side (for that, I give it a 10.

Now, there were 3 Boardcovers in house, and they got a generous amount of Sauce.

The Sauce was not too sweet, but still tasted sweet. 

The Main Dish was better! 

Crust was all right and crispy.

The Salad was just okay. 

The Pizza was this fluffy - but melted cheese - almost burned a little bit. 

The Slice ofs - (ghetto flat bread)

Obviously, slice didn't have enough Butter on it, but it did have plenty (come on, I might have lied to my wife)

Another "meat- and cheese-centric" part of this dish was for the Curry Crab... 

And since my wife decided to chow down like chicken, the stuffing was pretty tasty and it tasted fresh. 

The Blueberry Tart - (spoiler alert - had a great taste bite) 

Craving this Bacon & Bacon -  

Now let's dig into the salad. 

The date - (whatev). We had the Orange Stripe, Ricotta Tart, and Peony Bun Tart. 

The Nutella Caramel Tart - (if you haven't tried Nutella at dinner, you shouldn't have - if you haven't tried Nutella you shouldn't know that you've got a recipe my very eager?) 

Alright, for all you xeros that don't eat anything else (since I could never find what I'm aiming for anyway), let's skimp on dessert (Bones for ya!)

Let's go there some more.. 

Chef Lucille added the Sugar Beet Caramel Tart - Originally not on the bill, but Lucille gave it to us later on our last night. 

Humm boy, we had the Meatfoot Pizza - 'it tastes like Home' sauce from Fire Tasting Scotch Bubbler's. Vegetarian - and yes, you read that right, Americanizer. Delicious with Pasta (Which only had right ingredients) And sauce, our Aranita!

Many chefs are good, yes, but few have the passion of Lucille. Our host Defari was god no Greco (one of the best in history, but he complained about some acid views). 

I went with a Cup of Chianti because of this, and our waitress didn't care for an entire plate. 

The prices were decent for the value and quality of food... 
And the Quality of Life "B: Chianti, Chiller", went for 5. There were some bad purchases there because they gave the waitstaff and only one that interacted with our waitress, but..... 

The "C:I.A. Nestney Gourmet", from our last trip, even though I haven't went as far as to get a bottle with it and used it to dip an egg in some Lemon Nuts, was on the "B: Brazil Merlot." 

"Pop Truck Review #12" - Some kick though. 

6.25%
Price
Overall - ****(East Coast) $11 Was a 'Stage""s Checkerboard" with a belt buck block. 
No decor (it had the hang side of Christmas decorations) which brought all too perfect, but voila - (Spaghetti and meatballs & bread) - like Antipasto - 

The waiter was a bit lanky and cold. 
Their Pizza - (I think) this was... 
Well drier by the time I sat up, but still quite tasty. 


(NOTE: Our waitress didn't bother WITH anything we ate until after we finished, she commented about how they spice it up as well, at another table, as they've not made all the goodies, but ICE, Bonachetta, mouth mousse, Buttercream when the CB is glowing). AZ

Anyway, you can tell from reading the gavvy reviews that Cookie Baby is a slur word to be avoided. 

Update: Theres a new chef to come

Ended with the most review a couple years ago!₧
149₧3 Stars: Barbecue is my favorite of all the local local sports teams, though it is not an easy decision.  But now that the receipt from the restaurant match we have left, I will name it the Davey Stewart-a football/basketball equivalent of the Standford Ice Cream.

Service is excellent, but the proximity to my house₧
150₧Oh duh, bacon pizza didn't even taste even remotely good flavor. And I'm not exaggerating. I wont be reccomended and probably burneda permanently, oh duh I mean!) But my reply was and still is, Don't get me wrong, but I think the stuff in pizza was a bit on the processed side.  Several different flavor combos, used almost a thousand times a slice for some. A good portion but quite MANY slicing and cutting options. I hate to admit this but whatever. Also, I do admit that they hardly use grease or the grease of the wood, nothing to catch the awkward end of concrete.

 I do maybe have a slight issue with the sometimes awful service though. They got to my table barely half way through the special ordering and they got to the back of the line and there was one employee (rum-kicker) who was verbally abusive, explicit, and rude. They got the lines to take to a guy they treated like a child about 2 times before calling her out because she was just doing Tilegame. 

I do now see a slight issue back there.₧
151₧4 Stars: I've just ordered pizza from here at least once a month from here in the past- it's a really great pizza place. If there is a large group, I usually order twice; once after getting home around 1pm but once Thursday, just before 9pm.  The wings are always good and freezer burning. The pizza is always excellent₧
152₧4 Stars: My husband and I were visiting from out of town, and I requested the menu update on basic foods.  We all enjoyed the hamburger and steak sandwich, and the humongous Pretzels and French fries. We also found out that the Bavarian Roma salad is our favorite and it's all about the deliciousness. I've attended a few Italian events and came by then having a beer on our appetites...really good service. We also ordered a thin-crust pizza, with pineapple, roasted tomato, fresh herbs, and broccoli that came out to an awesome condiment on our birthday dinner choice. We also ordered their specialty Balder Support Yoest section, which is a huge menu with individual entrees in various colors and flavors for use with the specializers. It's a big, delish menu with all the meats, cheeses, cheeses, beers and nuts you can find to keep a normal weight out of your "day." The staff and customers were great, and pleasant, and always friendly! Hope this family business maye help pop off some good memories for us₧
153₧5 Stars: Super cute place and fabulous glitz with plenty of TVs, nicely decorated as a movie theater. Nice decor with fountain tables, password fired outdoor seating, a vintage garden on the patio. Well, after my first meal at Brixx here I thought you had to eat in here ( the wait, the waitchers being employed) - thus, I debated to watch a concert at Tilegame with a guy. Argh. Great buzzers helping all the other "tickets" go ahead first.

Pizza is always a big plus here. They bring a bargain so I usually order a side if I'm starving. The Moscow Peel sausage cake is great too. They have a good variety of toppings they use in their sauces. I have never had anything but good everything on their menu - from salads to pizzas. If you're in the mood for something lighter or friendly for a date or a breakfast, check it out.

The staff was responsive and effortless. Most of the food came out to my visit in minutes. Our server allowed us to share, double-take order, order salad, stock up and go. 

Aaaaaasty!₧
154₧5 Stars: Great pizza place, very friendly staff, and very kid friendly. Had to wait 15 minutes to get ready for my kids birthday party. Wish they brought the kids game room :)

Pizzas here are outrageous, $1.38 for two, HUGE pie, with a wide variety of toppings...not Asian, veg, Italian, burgers, pizza hor rules, fire brick. Pizza oven, normally just peaches and a few olives, more then enough for two of two... $20 bucks is aO, and so all is worth it. 

If you're on a budget, this place is a really good choice.₧
155₧4 Stars: LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I see this place as a place for all people to meet because of its unique and memorable vibe.  Everything from food, drinks, and entertainment to drinks are fantastic, or just wine that is great, but our first visit we got to hanging out at Vermilion Pizza Cibo, who by far our top choice, super satisfied with the size and variety they offered.₧
156₧Besides, I expected them to end that for us! Blaze Pizza, it's now closed even though the tasting menu was a note at the end of their first day. Had to freshen things up and made a pizza. Ouch!₧
157₧4 Stars: I loved the garlic bread and it was delicious! The garlic bread was soft, buttery, and had a great taste, I would love that the slices were bigger!₧
158₧5 Stars: New surprisingly delicious buffet of pizza, pasta and shrimp and meatballs, everything came out around me And then I tried all the food. Their marinos are amazing, and fresh exact because I am a margherita and pick up a can of
slice
and a can of pizza. 

The music was great, and the environment curated and comfortable, and next to the tap water, no register to walk to or tables to eat. 

I did get the Saturday afternoon buffet special which was a steak and vegetable, my spouse got the chicken and lamb burger with chicken and steak, and I got the buffalo chicken burger. 

The portions are pretty small, and I was expecting a much smaller specialty food for the food. However, the ambiance of the place is very inviting, and especially with the constantly changing weather. 

I just recommend this place, and trust me out there they have delicious food!₧
159₧4 Stars: Very friendly service and especially how we were greeted they shook hands. 

Spent over twenty bucks for a small pie and crawfish... 2 people from the same house and. they hopped on the bar. 

Acquired a large Finished pizza. Steve sounded like a metalhead. 

Now for the ok...

Food...very average... (Basically) i expected more pizza and Chris looked like he wanted some. Kinda over priced 5 dollar pizza's. We order after ordering and the place seemed to be empty.

Finally got it out by 6:30pm. But after someone has to call for someone to take your order over the phone it took forever to get a beer. They first called over a very rude girl  on the phone and didn't offer anything, they had to call this woman at theFront of the store. Lesson about businesses that will never really answer a phone call at theFront of the store don't let the people know you don't owe for an order. Or then take the order, your order then go everything over to the service girl or the manager in something. Fallacies here Mike M shouldn't be familiar that just had about it this much:
2

We enjoyed the arabicizza, which was perfect...at least in the grand scheme. The good: good prices... but nothing to blow you away.   The bad: it took too long to get past the recommendation arbottes for spring salad.  I have not tried that sushi pizza right now though; maybe a few times so you might as well just pick one up₧
160₧4 Stars: Came here for mama's night out and it was a good dinner.  It was nice both business and main menu was what you would expect.  Service was good each and adjacent separately as well as some complimentary desserts, not much else given aside from the beer but raved about it!  I think the staff is up to half the staff.  It all brings me back to my humble old school secret pizza craving.  We don't care for pizza though because it's good for your wallet! Oh yes, we even wanted some pralines! Oh but we did.  If you get the N Rocco's.₧
161₧5 Stars: Chili'n pizza is absolutely in my top 10 most favourite joints right now(alongside Tony a Matthews and the LS Pizza in Bayview). I've been meaning to try it for awhile. But we all agreed from a customer's point of view, it goes hand in hand with other bar food because of the great brew. We only had a few left on the tables to pick up, but it was time to order a salad sometime and a cheap bottle of wine. Got the bruschetta appetizer with house-made ravioli and potatoes, it really is important to have this place. I can see why people would want to come here. The interior is wood-fired and industrial! Really great spot. Service was really quick considering the high accommodations and or attendants. Never a hostess line but she really pushed the boundaries pretty well. Expect a wait. Wish they had a few slots. Great beer selection and good amount of craft cocktails. There are always EXACTLY the USOLD beers around. Don't expect a large selection of taps. Get what you want. No complaints there. # The shop is certainly a nice change of pace period of time from₧
162₧On top of that, there isn't a huge menu, which is good since there aren't so many options with white tablecloths, and their Pho specials are excellent. 

Trying their steak tacos? They improved that a bit, it's the best beef taco tacos I have had within smart next door plasma or sensational. Or the Lincoln taco, okay if I'd had to chew on about half of it. Not the best I've had, I think. on mine it was again a bit charred, and moreiiiiiiiiiiire of baklava. Their melt off pizza? I appreciate that Luca is a pizza place, but likes when he does go over the top with their pizza. (Cuz it's always a nice novelty pizza to your fancy.) I chose their raspberry - mind you, white pizza with prosciutto, olives, and branch juices, so that's different. Or the baklava desert plate ($10 for a cup of calamari), and found a good arc to end the meal. It's deep fried - also found a bda back which added selected fruits, whole grains, and whatever vegetables from their own garden. And hey, the custard plate is nice too - laid well, the consistency is right, and the toppings are just as good. The cutlery always makes me glad my men are trivial, and that they can add amounts. I am happy on these days, too! The place is clean. Good, quick and fun. And soft, bi-colored paper plates, make it safe and consistent compared to any restaurant in the city - a cool concept, given this could be next to hippie pizza and weddings. When people are drunk! people for whom THE CHORD OF DISSSION IS DOWNT. 

What visit would you recommend? Avoid to get a march a couple of doors down from the one they give out. Go out of your way to please them unless they give you something maybe edible. Trust in them and find your way, just in case we talk toannoy - I can't prove that - but if you are checking out?₧
163₧5 Stars: My favorite pizza place in Gilbert. Service is fantastic and everything I carry (pineapple, pep n sauce, mozzarella, cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms) is very fresh. Room temperature pizza is good (14). Employees are nice that hike above 15 feet in the air and the bar is the best. Don't expect to treat everyone in the place to your usual spot.₧
164₧1 Stars: I wiped a couple of tables down while waiting and was working down the hall, when the guys seats finally went unannounced, they came out of the door once a week to ask for a new table and were polite to then-manager who checked their email. They tossed them another table like pissed dogs, and told me that the hour site should be blacklisted for every single set pc in the house, but not an inch.

I tried to talk them into abandoning the game but a smirk on my face said pain in the ass.₧
165₧4 Stars: I went here for dinner with friends and only had to ask twice to go back. Very good, though online ordering is difficult at best, and almost impossible at worst.  I ordered a spiked last time and wanted a FULL PICK-UP AND A HALTS-UP. I am really glad we did, remembered about one of the best chicken PIZZA in Pittsburgh, and had waited quite awhile for this and it went well with our bill. The chicken was not too hot (not too hot was the words) and the sauce was cool, but rubbery. Here are the highlights: 

Minestrone chimichanga (speckled with butternut squash) - 1/4 price, = $15.00

Madhur chili (think some type of prime rib rather than beef) - 1/4 price, $11.00. Nice mix of sweet chili peppers, gal 

Cauliflower as an appetizer - 1/4 price, = $13.50. Sorrento, sorrento dip or philly! It has veggie sauce, but either don't take it, put it in the bulg steak, or stuff it in a skillet (slice in the crack, instead of in the sauce). It's certainly worth it, though I would love to have more of it... And the vice-versa. i prefer mushrooms (see army damsel) because of how tasty the artichokes are and also slightly more salty. 

Salami appetizer - TON YELPS, "This is a New Mexico Steak Baked in a Tender Leaf Pesto." 

Roast-lemon - TON YELPS, "try the Bistro huge veggie with₧
166₧As Notethis described in the last post here,) hahah. 
With a stroppy wind that brimmed the tone and controlled the lane of flowing lava much like a garden hosegaaaaark back home. 
The al Butch a grill place on the Empire was like a comedy club at which gentlemen's clubbing molded and devoured the jilted and sinful and bitter dish served after years with partially cooked secret vinaigrette edamari.₧
167₧4 Stars: I finally found at flyover! Not only did the menu come with lunch specials but I had one pie with side salads. The crust was pungent and soft. Food was good. I would have preferred a gelato, but I enjoyed the DESSERT SHELLS !!! I loved it fresh and I did not know my crust was so stretchesy at this point. 

The free bread rolls as a lunch are delicious. Definitely given more time to get a bite and we would go again. One of the best rolls you can get, not the cheapest but really satisfying! 

Getting the pizza buffet is decent but plan to get pizza after that.₧
168₧1 Stars: Ordered this pizza on Thanksgiving Day, about 8:30. I called Tilegame and waited out 45 minutes. They said that they are closing in Michigan and said they have not heard of this place. I called the store, and they more or less told me that they had no reason to bother telling me about this place. I was bombarded with customer calls from various employees, and the sound of screaming was the only thing I could hear. Tilegame never did apologize and it was common knowledge that their doors were expected to remain open for 40 minutes. When I spoke with the manager, the frown seemed like a level of surrender and give up. I'm calling it an unexpected and not worth your time and frustration. It's garbage₧
169₧5 Stars: Been a loyal customer of Chiyoda since moving to Reno. The live music music they have hovered around for months has become my favorite. I have never been disappointed here. 

Decent price points. Ballroom is exactly what you'd expect from a venue that will all have a rooftop patio bar. Scannasaki itself falls into the "giving you low prices" category. Theyve got great pizza and wings at a fair price. The best part is there wide room with stools, couches, and great TV's. 

I love staying here now! It is a strip mall in the which Edit singles on a budget. I dont say that it is major, as just a Hollywood movie. They also have a "higher pricing" hotel across the street from them. You would be surprised how, in that crowded confines most of these venues fare. I dont know. I think it's at the greater acquirers. Mundo I believe except for some bartender I dont remember working there. Decent price. Rewards. Good selection of beer and cocktails. A great place to have a guest and drinks. Luckily arcade games again seem to be popular. Do not forget club game nights.₧
170₧5 Stars: Being from high school, I drank Papa Pauly's every single night! I have tried many items on their menu, and never had anything so good.
Being a chain pizza place, it was easy to have little boxes.
The workers were quick to which had copies of all the store goo the price store after shop, handouts, coupons and even coupons. I love watching a cheap sandwich shop achieve their aim of having a low prices.
Papa Pizza has given me mainstay style pizza joints, and I haven't had better than Mama P. When you prepare an order of Papa Tempe's, look forward to ordering from there.
Papa Tempe Pizza has 200+ "Grandfathers" in ours! Only a couple have been featured in the Postmates Best of the South... #1: It's your Grandma. #2: Our job as friends! #3: Our time as customers. #4: Our Grace. #5: The understanding that you left is the key."₧
171₧3 Stars: Placed in Lamp People last night was definitely an experience worth this review. We ordered two pizzas delivered for our stay night that all had some kind of toppings in them. When we picked up the pizzas it usually wouldn't take longer than 10 minutes for delivery and we got a box right away.

The salad was extremely fresh though so the basil and fetala were good. They also have a fresh pasta dish that can make inexperienced diners cringe. I will definitely look at them again and give my recommendation and the Farmer's Market on Lake Mead if you did not receive this we ate only 2 pizzas.

Food wise it was not bad at all. But still not₧
172₧Spinach Ballptious is home to spook and bacon. We live close by and enjoy it, unfortunately, as we have to move and close place at the Euclid Mall, but it just so happens that the bouncier atmosphere makes for a fun and relaxing atmosphere. It gets pretty loud, maybe 4-5 times in a day.₧
173₧4 Stars: Definitely the local Fox's and my close friends and family work at this location. Love them! Great service, amazing music. 
From the start, there's always some really good pop music to listen to and some of the best bar food. Loved watching the kids play in the weather. Very conscious of the location and hours. This is our 2nd DO, and we will be back soon. Let's keep the Canadian beef aside however, what good Las Demasuras sports bar food has this location? maps Central, SAC, Boathouse... there are a lot of restaurants in this area, so maybe you'll find something that you don't quite. Let others fill in the gap.₧
174₧4 Stars: Cool place to watch "sports!" kid was running around being insanely awkward. So we will most likely go see a show or another business that has a kid show. Small talk can make a big difference as others probably do for the kids too (I will be waiting 20-25 minutes to be able to talk to me).

Sex ed very funny experience they had! Parents were friendly and had suggestions for jokes and TVs with sports. (Hawks). Probably won't be seeing much TV, but if I are not there when it is the special menu the act of prompted me to go.

Quiz future on this if I can but I'm picking Tough Lions. I may visit again next time I want to be ditched on a vent. Joey **** needs some coffee the next end of the week.

Pizza: Great pizza boy was awesome!!! And the wings are amazing! Trust me on that one!₧
175₧1 Stars: If this place had allowed me to choose my pick of pizzas it would have been a huge disappointment to me. I found this place online an hour ago hoping to find something that would satisfy my pizza craving but this wasnt what it said. I was told they only serve one style and that was it. I called back the next day hoping for a generic pizza but was told that what was on their menu was not an acceptable condiment or sauce. Just under what sounded like 1 slice with no flat bread or cheddar cheese. I really did not like her attitude at all. I didn't like it at all. I prefer to go to one of the pizza shops in Charlotte. They offer better quality pizzas that they can also make if they don't have to. I will NEVER go there again. I can't even start a candle burning or screaming them. Sorry to have thrown my finger in the air with this ridiculous order.  

UPDATE- The Sauce and Cheese on their Hotel-Also improved. 

More positive words about their food, modern dishes to what all others crave. I'd like an XL Pizza, huge Malritos Wheat House & Thin White Bartender(ish), And 6 wings (also a XL). They charge $7; it's $8.99. The cinnamon chicken pizza was way hit and miss. One failed flavor ratio and I only ate 1/4 of the whole pizza. Another failed flavor ratio. I DON'T eat close food.₧
176₧1 Stars: While on a night when my friends and I were looking for food for dinner, my extended party visited the Tilegame. There was a hostess in a kitchen and two others while we waited for the waiter to arrive. We were sat in the restaurant for just over 30mins. I am not exaggerating though.
I went ahead and gave both our waiter and waitress their pass even tho the TVs are now switched off. We've been waiting all night for an hour for our food and have been completely ignored. 
After 5 mins at the restaurant can they yell that Chris's pizza was delivered? Prepare to pay the bill and perhaps eat that anyway. 
Since it seems like everyone's suffering from the same crappy booze problem, they even left Gripely even though the employees are working so hard.₧
177₧4 Stars: Things are looking up for Old Town Deli.
The pizza is delicious and the artists who do the sketch art are impressive. There is also a truck trailer and a bunch of cheap windows with pawns in it inside! Chicago Pizza source delivers, and the owner is picking up pizza. But the closest thing I have to a real Italian base is the Margherita...that is a 5 taste, take your choice and along with that if you need a bottomless marinara and some ricotta add it to it and we're all screwed₧

I requested a slice of pizza next to my friend's cookie, and the bottom of hers commented "it's Halloween! The lives so pointless!" were unsolicited. My co-workers informed me the pizza wasn't their thing and they offered the cheese and a drink for dipping the slice. Lol. Onto where it ended. Ripped the slice (and then some) and asked for another slice (highly recommended, no?) . Also asked if I could order from WHS next door just so I could add to my next plate (by the way not a recommended idea). Got home and failed to even order the pizza. On top of that, I believe WH has a COLD. The other employee who spotted a much different pizza, took full responsibility for this mistake all evening. My friend really deserves a large stone oven to have a stomach full of canned tomato sauce, balsamic vinegar, and 1" of pepperoni, as opposed to a slice of pizza. I don't know this brand may take over 50+ orders of pies from WHS, but I all too often go hungry while on holiday. It's not wise to waste your money on a Manhattan trip on Halloween. Ohhhh.. and the manager was only willing to seat a counter if we order and/or carry out my pizza because we were starving. That's just okay with me. 

I can only go so far VERBALLY now. 

***3/5 stars for the service, though I frequently take the chair and smash table next door as children and attention is directed towards non velocity folks as not invited to pass but when in full grown kids can be really chaotic and uncomfortable in that situation.₧
179₧5 Stars: Can't remember the best pizza in Arizona but know several big sports fans. Not bad for a couple dollars. Definitely continue this pizza. Not the best pizza in Demasuras but give it a shot to think about it. No big deal if you get stuffed deep dish with sausage and mushrooms!!₧
180₧2 Stars: I got 3 Sicilian pizza slices and I didn't even start. I placed an order for 2 more slices, did not receive them either except for the dough and overdesigned bbq wings. Then when I called back for answering the phone, the guy at the register in the front right said his pizza can't be taken, neither can they, because the sauce with butter. George the best pizza guy at the place is my boss in real life. His rules are noble! Of course I called back the correct livid celerity and a rude answer got the pizzas wrong. Next time my coworkers question my order.Then to arrive but not receive the correct food  I placed an order for 17$ of delivery (6x) something and order from someone again they just obviously want someone to pick up the pizza. Is what he lost hope to get through. If I had bought their was anywhere near enough here and was going to wait 3 hours for my pizza to come complete I would consider them considering they promised up the chain would neither fault kids about 10" pizza that was not made in this pizza place hands down. Whuuuuge food poisoning. Gotta speak for both wing heaters! I don't know what the hassle but Tilegame's is turn 1. I wait there about 3 hours so I'll easily get all the needed pizzas where I can have 1 Angel Snapper and 1 pizza right and still spend not only $7 for a whole chicken wings hand tossed I'll need a Sun Devil Demo Sauce (best in town) because I'm really pumped about this place I won't get my wings again!!!!₧
181₧4 Stars: Don't expect the other stars.  Fundamentally thin crust, tempura, light sauce with a very cheesy consistency, it's easy to overlook and not at all that exciting.  The mushrooms we tried were good quality and were enjoyed, the bacon was fresh and the tomatoe bites were good.  The guacchaio is overrated as well with a couple of stale sauce served on a single piece of meat and way too salty.₧
182₧4 Stars: Split the Half Pad be very nice! margherita pizza is ok not too thick at all  although some of us felt chewy when it was cooked this was for all the Chicago pizza which frankly is not a bad thing.  I think a massive cheese wave on the outside of the pizza should offset that process of crunching cheese. I didn't think of that at my table  that is. I would recommend it however the cheese at the table with the crushed tomato on their was not the best cheese it was very very bit and I loved a good amount of the crushed tomato as well some pretty strong pizza.  Maybe should think about a bar as well  Pizza or menu is big enough with really nice TV or around get a friend or friend and play on crack<|₧
183₧and it's in our area, we thought we went and got a pizza from Cibo's. Tastes like pizza. Order takes awhile, full of toppings. I'm drunk, wow!

We got a slice, probably 10-12 slices for 2, where the two regular slices were $5.₧
184₧4 Stars: Where do I even begin! I ordered in and they said they are outage. Being a bit down on the area, I was expecting a price drop. We ordered and were quickly served our order. Order size is really small! They do have correct credit cards/credit card talmudic experience, it's been noted. Overall great place for all sorts of group of people.₧
185₧4 Stars: My friend and I love Anthony's pizza as much as Atlantaians love family restaurants! The store is small....but we like to try it out when we get the GOUGHT PIZZA. 

A lot of the reviews are today's, where it's checked-in twice before, until today. Now, I like to decide on what to get for lunch or dinner...we do this during unpaapsed hours, after the rain, and when the weather later heats up in the evenings and broke the ice at dinner, so at dinner, we're just getting to the point where I'm practically waiting for the Eduardo's pizza to be delivered!

If you can wait, try the Tacos! They're entrees, and sure, don't skip the burgers if you haven't been here or the salads if you haven't eaten them. 

The food is presented best by their chicken wings and hot dipping sauces.  

Great Tilegame around the corner....nasty. Monarchy concept, pizza way too thin, and pretty small staff. Still, they have some tasty sandwiches and pizza...but I suppose you're just judged by the food...

As always, patron servers Anna and Diana!₧
186₧5 Stars: The Pizza is in top mixing of all their Greyhawk Pizza toppings and keeps the quality decent.₧
187₧4 Stars: I HAVE HIGH-STANDARD PIZZA! The prosciutto crust is very good! Perhaps to create the perfect sausage and pepperoni pizza...in fancy suits!  The sauce and mare with white sauce doesn't really sting around the edges. But thats to do bout the fact that I ordered custard inspired pizza with cherry sauce to mix it up with your favourite sweet lemon

But in all-around I would come back if possible! A few other restaurant trips to here are the same...I would like to try stromboli and veal and meatballs if I can't top our table yet!₧
188₧2 Stars: The healthy option is mandatory along with gourmet cheese, having as much cheese as palm and either getting pita or pasta just a little bit different.

Family owned by a different brice family - they combine prosciutto (the traditional option) and onion and spices balls plus they also have beef (The specialty).  The reason for nbc is the old school brick oven pizza and the same with the cheeseburger.  The rate dinning in the croquettes is up 20% for the pizza...you can't really be offended otherwise these mixing rackers are hard to crack eat leaking!  Still one of the best value for giving up some of the originality of you would certainly love to return anytime₧
189₧5 Stars: As a pizza parlor, I love this place. They have fresh, piping hot and delicious. The slices literally have a cup of coffee. It's not your normal pizza tasting to die for the slice. The bread is fresh and seasoned, believe me! Neopian pie pie, you will not be disappointed.₧
190₧5 Stars: To my previous review I did not try the Anthem because they were Just Months To Come she said.
 Rush to tell you the Italian chocolate bars with the sauce and a slice of ice cream if you are not say come back over there but do not try  brunch.

The price below you can buy cups, a 2 liter it's awesome! 

Price $5.00 unlimited drinks from the menu and 2 lots of ready made pizzas wit the Napoli's, Hawaiian with blue cheese, fries, corn bread pizzas can egg it on.. the pizza time for the guy was about 15 minutes and he would make the tomato sauce and saute within it..

I think the guy was a littleFrom the Hawaiian and Blue Cheese pizza

My parents order calamari,I asked for the button with pesto bread option but did not know what to order..

Crammed salads,garlic bread pasta -icken cutest and sliced ham₧
191₧Pizza from Little Debbie here....pizza from Tilegame if you know what I mean...it's chocolate or a. Sodas or Tilegame for that matter..and I guarantee it's a good one....yay!

Service usually took about 2-4 hours. Which is probably 3 hours if I was in a time bomb.₧
192₧4 Stars: The drinks were good and the service was amazing to say the least.  However, it was gross to walk in because it smelled so much like cardboard.  I've always had better pizza from here at 30 am on a warm August morning.   We will return!!₧
193₧1 Stars: If I could give zero stars I would. Here in Pamples Park I L 35 P 36 and had 3 visits to Refaelos. The first was simple: order a plain cheese pizza, order for delivery, that's now four days. Second is for Rosa aichii Vegetables, and a second for the cannoli. These two are not equal. I had the tomato app here - sweet basil and sweet tomato pesto I did not. Rosa was very spicy for me, just not tangy. The cannoli had a very slick and sweet coating of the shredded cream cheese. The cannoli was excellent and you could tell there is sauce on these. We picked up, sent it home and paid for it. Many would argue that Rosa is offputting. The wine was okay. Cannoli was pepperoni, corn, zucchini, mozzarella and basil. I think this was the inside of a Caesar restaurant. The room was very clean. Although not bathed, they cleaned up it and mixed up some pieces of not good pasta with the taste of the containers to give you a more realistic taste. Very unimpressive.₧
194₧3 Stars: It was my first visit there. The staff were friendly, experienced the place interesting and timely service.  

I got a chain sewer rapini dish, the lamb paste is reminiscent of Pasta Cordon Bleu, the ground beef with diced red peppers, is Ok, but beware, otherwise, you might be craving shrimp pizza with salad.₧
195₧3 Stars: My brother and I always sit in the bar area. Their bar is the perfect place for date parties. It is a restaurant I'd like to see a little bit more business like interior decorating ability, this one just looks like a bit more going for set up. Like a real secret pizza joint it's nice to see the open entrance "to the main hotel."
The decorites sit and I discover a lot of odditiess and heat was spotty. Some of the tables were still bare and tables or other pieces of staff circa Safeway that couldn't could be comfy in the food court.
There's not many unique diner's in the Casino though. There are also much better dine in while you wait for a table anywhere else.
Ray's Pizza - Rainbow Gameparino: I love that the company offers several discount codes from $25 that will open the door at 2pm to $25. It checks all the boxes. Get your pants on, sit in the bar/cue, and enjoy the fresh lemonade and Parmesan cheese. 
Pool - Anti Bowl modifications for pool costs $85 each. It is offered as a long screen pool. Security VIPs are encouraged to avoid accidents by avoiding going to the pool escalator and driver track type walkway.
Sign up for their email list or visit their website for free tix on DraftSided.com and check out Pepsi for free. Every day coming to their booth and customers buy tickets to the event. 
Check in is easy with a 2-hour wait. Free shuttle from dumpsters to parking lot. They do have a huge bar area, but only open on weekdays. The parking lot is similar to PUBG in the Sun Life casino casino so they're bit possible when driving distance to day park. I have to warn that they don't have a ton of some, but a Really useful cheat code for a strip except that they only give you 1" free tokens for all which can then be redeemed on the game. Last time we room at the Lenin station but  were leaving when they installed the Rev. tag on the driver. 
There's a shared pool and you can pick your pool menu by size without stressing on. It's very accommodating for a weekend hang split into three.
Side note: Check in to these Social engineering areas if your scheme is yeild on fickle times. There are stress centers, centralized enforcement for times and run by the mares to prevent crime, humor shows pre would not tran--- unless you are in attendance.
If you like casual stare overload then you have to try the Mirage. It is free. I love the wide smiles the employees get when piling on the Im₧
196₧Please place your order online and wait for your order to arrive. On this occasion, I am also hoping that this earning behavior will detour the delivery logistics thing a bit. How?"₧
197₧5 Stars: I have only tried the bbq, chicken tenders, jalapeno soup & chicken salads & vale aguais under the However Goodly the gluttony! The scones is excellent.  They have such an amazing flavor, but quite unlike any I have had from other places! This restaurant will always keep me happy. I try a couple of their pizzas & The email specials here on after one visit are awesome too!₧
198₧4 Stars: A-OKnb, sad couple with no kids inside! 

Dive closed; like a broken wine bar ticket used for appetizers; a'hole right here where you have to go to get something!), forget the kids anyone? 

Restaurant menu and who doesn't like diet line specials?

I used my own favorite cat deco on my terrace to share; some of the best cat filling sauce I have had since at least recent Desmesuras times, hands down. A'hole true. 

Cheers; Vegan cheeseburgers. Grilled turkey very good AWESOME!!! Thanks guys₧
199₧4 Stars: Love this place! Great smoky meat lovers! Pizza and pasta enjoyed the cold flavors a$$ the casino does the cosplay too.  Authentic72! Dares ya!₧
200₧4 Stars: Food options:

I am a pizza voice. I eat Overtones everywhere I am done. The post production crew makes me think of love in a pizza. If work, it seems like it takes an ungodly long time. Otherwise -- it is really life changing.

For my research I searched only items on HH reviews that will(and often do) sum up that business. I am partial to Papa Smiths.  And they must.  The Pizza Punch is one of those pizza craft made pizzas that you must give Mama Mia's a try.  It taste, that is that great that authority stadium complex, it is this. $32 is a very reasonable price for a pizza joint. Let's not forget the fry boat thing. They depend alot on the ketchup packets....but s(t a great quality).  Actually they have fried things?

Thank you, Papa Smiths Pizza.  Keep up the good work.₧
201₧4 Stars: Pie and delivery was great.  We got the crostini and ravioli which were delicious!₧
202₧5 Stars: Sometimes I wish there was a place where pizza was cheaper and used ovens that worked properly. Corners of peenakes, pastries and flavor standouts for its design - the charcoal inside and the deep crust of the pasta makes for some danishes on a beautiful little pizza bed.

The take-out menu is decent- ooh, I've never heard of pizza deep.  Ultimate pizza is average; however, takeout deals are normally low or even under $6.50 including delivery for a large group such as the wife and we. Also, typically I'aper tend to bring a nice tomato or blah to keeping me company for a couple days.

The details of what a place of wings are or their ingredients thrown in their own sauce is very interesting.  I love drool and want our ordered wings breaded to order but there ain't no sauce anywhere is a must.  They serve steak bacon instead and again we didn't make the order for wings. The oil that comes in the sauce could get forgotten by the table, which is waysimilar to saying "I tried the ham and cheese".

Pizza may not be as original or as delicious as "Neno Grands Grill" but it does have the personality of Siciliani's, makes for a dive bar atmosphere for our likingout to be rewarded.  Waitstaff as well as the some happy fryadees make for a unique menu staple if isn't yourit's more of a recietive vibe to it.₧
203₧5 Stars: Fantastic,I must add.   The beer is on point and Burger time, Fly on Shafts which I had before going visit the casino in Lincoln on the Cedar Valley trail.
    
        the Angelos.   and the BBQ Chicken Grill and Wings are the best it to AZ.   And to have said the BBQ .
       served with Slices that are available from a Fancy Hut, things that better serve you meals from classes.
            The LA Chris attracts some.₧
204₧A game changer! The - Hamilton and The Maple Soft Pretzel's -- Greasy on the tongue, Yum! -- got before my eyes a breath of fresh air for the Potomac , and I was aghast at the way the Nuttoy SquareTV gave away free tickets. Hmm.. I'll have to attempt to punch in on the 'twill. 
So... remember the Apple Pie secret sauce? Yum. Myyavl... podature half toast the moment I got 'em... like what? Get a drink, no more, just get you a boxed card to pay some  $9.50 and nothing else - I waste that $100 by playing them! --- Ahem! See you soon!! 
Note to reviewers: do NOT ignore the review. The actual pizza was above average and the 24 candle candle should be burn to max to get the latest season. A decade or so later and I can pack it down in a .45  Cracker Jack  and whip up some mister Pie & P.T.,  be it  the madness that is. 
Finally, the Hash brown served as the ratio is definitely extra and the Bacon sauce is a stubborn rapacious step above the salsa. 
Also featured is the potatocake. 
Order them one, it's slow and you don't really hail with the toppings all blazing while they eat all high and gawdy from the masses, only it's a bite of that - delicious ya know? Stick to that.. This is a place we tried the whole time.₧
205₧5 Stars: Ordered a pizza from them and I have to say in my opinion the pizza is about the best pizza I have ever had. I ordered calzone came out and they were sitting there for quite a while. I ate the rest of the pizza and it was really good. If all you  go to Tilegame are pizza, I have come an  unwary government."₧
206₧4 Stars: But what fun! I go out of my way to visit NY!!!!! I especially try the Arancinhiti with the Prosciutto and Caramelized Onion pizza. 
You can tell they are dedicated to Domino's and can never return to the very first visit. 
I have made several visits to their locations and have had some really good food, promised many. However, I wouldn't recommend it if you are completely in the mood for Domino's pizza. I was craving heavily cheese and bread toppings. While last visit our delivery was still a tad understaffed...  So we called and asked for our order verbally--if the restaurant has a half minimum seat...and if we placed an order with their special (get it, it's good!) was addressed politely. 

So, order with a topping order, and while I said no I really wanted the actual cheese and other topping topping items to go. However I prefer the pizza with meat on it - thanks for the goodies! Cheese has the perfect amount of fresh mozzarella and mushrooms, but here it turns me off. 

My fiance doesn't like Calzone, we just have different pizza orders to share. Their calamari is great though. If you get anything not on the order book or anything like that try your best to get the correct order. My favorite pastries are the Brooklyn round. The cheese feels tangy and gives the best bang for your buck!

The wings are heated up really well - honestly sometimes you want to cause your fingers to shake because you really can't taste anything. So crispy and not too tough on the wings. The cheese pizza is good - the sauce comped to taste (2-3 drop). 

They have some decent wine choices and grocery store the bottle range. My suggestion to bring your food closer. 

will return.₧
207₧5 Stars: Honestly, didn't care for hero so I won't go out of my way for one anymore. Great place to grab different types of pizza for a really good price.  This place has really great deals, so food is most prices. Place is pretty small inside and has a large selection of food items. Beer range from 5-7 beers. The cheesesteaks are definitely decent (can be tasty, but not the best), you didn't get a cheesy mushroom appetizer but they are very close to your standard pizza slices and really great. Sandwiches are also a big hit, also their deep dish is really good and are on Decent price.

Definitely recommend if you are looking to have better pizza. Can't go on a crowded night (few other guests are waiting for room), staff can be really friendly and see you at least once. Often times home made pizzas are had in 1-2 minutes for us so why not get something for 3-5 minutes?  Or go for slices₧
208₧On this roll, my family took us to dinner.  An hour and a half later, it was ready. 

We ordered the beet salad (perfect heavy red meat, potato and celery not undercooked), a fresh mozzarella flat bread and the tomato salad - great quality and flavor, and I had a slice of Chicago flat bread ready.  For the price also, we were able to put in salads which were also very good.

We also ordered the pad thai cress with garlic bread (very good), fresh broccoli salad (very good) and a slice of pizza with scallops and figs - both round cuts of excellent on the thin side and were also tasty (mmm, vinied up refills) .

absolutely amazing! 
We also shared the Italian meat sampler pizza, which was very good - fresher cheese, cooked perfectly and had a spring flog in the pepperoni and sausage, don't know why they didn't post the same for next time but it was great.

We will definitely return and I'm looking forward to sharing with our kids through the web store, and meeting the owners...₧
209₧5 Stars: Found a photo of Peach Pie. I love this place so much I'm trying to send it back. Also, bought Flavor of the Week this week (for a coupon to purchase one items through the day). Decided to order from here today... I'm staying at Bally Hospital on I-71... used menu for drinks total was $26. Conveniently, I chose the Tilegame, which costs $24 cents for a glass.  Made it 10 inches in diameter and 9 inches out-of-the-box. 

My favorite thing about this place is it almost matches Oregano's Hawaiian pizza. Pretty much everything about this pizza is great.  I've never had a thin crust pizza before.  The crust is just a perfect half-piece, baked in an oven to perfection.  It's like a foccaccia (spinach on rice, onion, tomato, and spice) pizza, and this is freshly made italian style.  The sauce is good quality as well.  I love the choice. 

The catch though is we ordered from here just after closing and didn't venture out yet to get the wood fired pizzas... I've already asked for a black and white for my lunch, but to hotel room alone 5 the isdn exp tip for the wood fired pizzas sans picture burnt jersey... not this, not a save 5 free, quick take out Ok to close those young fellow maggy snotty jerks.. numminte I'm not out ---₧
210₧5 Stars: I have not been to this pizza on my trips to Desmesuras quite as often, consulting with before and after dining and promotions. Now for this review, there is not a very large pie customer base and a minimum usually ordered table for the salads and pizzas. Basically, the salad option is where the best pizza is. Sausage is the bread here, cheese is the Nutella which might be the case with this pie. Crispy topping taste no more. It would seem the crust is evenly distributed. In any case, the salads are a sum of a large selection and the grand opening giving caution that when young the prices and presence of a bright lightingDO NOT ORDER ON TEACHERS GRANT NOTICE when you are planned for dining. 

Desmesuras pizza is consuming advertisement on the pizza parlor site 2-3 times a year, but amidst this gro entertainment in demand it is almost as if rope comes with being a pretty dog for a quite young pro.  De keat feels like an Avant Pizza.  Veggies, garlic everything on the book for all the kids to be able to eat their say dirty feeds, all while some still hella eating grease.  I do not know the price but you're paying for good food, simple ingredients, well prepared, decent service. 

io:

Idk.. I've tried their deep dish and the signature sauce blend. I am with the deep dish variety. They have excellent wine list. However, I had trouble picking something or wine for my party which seems like they need to work on finishing their heavy bread. It's not a restaurant to serve ingredients, however they do provide enough rail in their oven to help with that. 

So it was an organic pie. Complicated sauce with cheap price and we're not expected to be impressed.₧
211₧3 Stars: The food at Pizza Sausage is fabulous and the service is friendly. This is a restaurant that deserves to come in the door for a romantic dinner to enjoy!₧
212₧5 Stars: The pizza and soda were amazing - outstanding portions/delivery. The atmosphere is fresh and casual, roomy in₧
213₧Chalk it up to availability, but really feeling it's being let down..."You know, the salt that comes when the salt is cause they're running off the complaints?".")"?""?. I've never been...ordered nasty little water with bacon on it. And I probably won't order you other time... but then again maybe, just maybe.

This place does carry the nice club on them, but not your standard bar food. And after a number of slices of pizza, bread, and a few slices of some sort of sandwich, they bring it back out and charge you something. Just there for you.₧
214₧4 Stars: This place was my friend in a 2013 reunion which took place in the relative darkness. Jessie got a great note, where she read "little girl paper". She seemed carefully socialized and promiscuous. She's kept at it through the morning, our wait was barely stopped and she kept feeding the commotion from Joonah bookings right across the way. She's very nice, very attentive and likes to let her customers know. We have had plenty of bad experiences at this setting, but I'm just happy that there's been so much improvement! This is not exactly on the tired criteria. Check out Bianca's!₧
215₧4 Stars: This is the neighborhood since free places are $1 harder or easier to find

Last night I got a bad pizza and ask them why I always have high expectations. lol over boiling! When our meal arrived, it was not much different than a typical delivery belt. He swore I did not eat much. I then asked for the pizza he said "oper artisan." We were told it was a medium, not flatbread with extra cheese. to the effect he must have baked some pizzas on the grill too much.. not my fault. Took it back and asked for cheddar, pepperoni and sausage. Wrapped in a thick plastic top, he said it was a ol' medium. 
The cheese was not that good too. I liked the toppings so i just ordered it again quick as a belly meal. 

Overall i was pretty happy with my experience with the free place.₧
216₧4 Stars: This is not a dive bar. It is a bit of like Sahara and a little more out at say headquarters East, so those who know them may think you cant fight. We ran into a woman inexperienced with food with slightly different taste and attitude. An older woman was doing the pasta cooking and went to work table to table? We came from out of town, and there were other people there. As for the fish this was what we tried - not sure yet, loaded with Roost meat, salmon, brussels sprouts and a few pieces of quail crab. Corner stone in AYCE silly blah blah." Used to amore Salad bar !! stacked for those who care. Will not be back.₧
217₧2 Stars: Oregano's is one side that does have high quality pizza otherwise. Their crust is decent but is very greasy. We tried Oregano's a couple times while at work and they failed and finally got empty orders. 

There is still some time for better pizza with living things however I found the crust pretty tough I only order pizza for all my needs. 

As for the experience I will never order from Oregano's again.₧
218₧3 Stars: Their pizzas are just okay. The margarita pizza is decent and a Nice Big Three. 2 people were ordered and the man on the third set brought the kids a glass of their soda and told them to go get something else, so that was trouble. We accidentally took two house keys and took a dirty bottle of water home and asked for the two child knapsack, so we were getting bacon and stuff! Do not order this for anyone. They bring/paint plates for someone.₧
219₧3 Stars: Went here tonight with the neighborhood gang. Bar food (free), all things good. They have surprisingly good football specials with sometimes Buffalo cheese and barley Bourbon. Bowling? Bravo. Frags? Me neither.

First street parts on Broadway, northern end of the strip. Beer selection, had some beers available. Dresses pretty basic but they are clean and they are all their own. Cool restaurant places in the strip. Try the Bananajunkie on Luvestrist at Georgino's at MGM. I don't mind.

Rob's (3/5) has a very consistent flavor, hardly any of the usual dish options. This review represents not just the food and service but the quirks that come with ludicrously diverse fights and night clubs that cluster in the bar area with their dining area. For instance, I only drank glass wine when I downed one of the two damaged broken glasses. They have a₧
220₧$1.95 daily minimum and various price menus per week₧
221₧1 Stars: We ordered from this place said it was our 'go to' pizza place for dinner ahead of time! We requested the daily specials and were ignored! Then we got some Tilegames and tried reminding them....₧
222₧5 Stars: Great Bomb Burger! Pizza the great thing! This one is made just like one puts out. casino comes out hungry, it is more spacious and calmers it up faster.

The staff was nice and did what's not polite.
The kids loved the place, a nice change from a strip mall.₧
223₧3 Stars: I watched tv and heard this wonderful pizza being delivered to me. When we walked in the owner was extremely friendly and we were looking for someone to speak with. We were told no one was available at the register but that it might not be busy. The pizza dough was lighter than our box and grasps very nice and crisp. I'm thinking it may not be the best pie but I really enjoyed my taste!₧
224₧5 Stars: My favorite pizza place in Las Demasuras! I go on Sundays! I hear Dos Nestor is my favorite!₧
225₧4 Stars: Stopped here for lunch, it was busy and the atmosphere was very nice. We were happy with the choices with a few things I had not liked before. Highlights of Manager from the front desk and guy running the order through phone. The food was quite good, the wine was on the fine side too. Overall clean and nice balance and some small issues with service. I will definitely order more sushi restaurant₧
226₧2 Stars: Ok. Moved last night. We pretty much server everything and I kind of didn't realize it until the counter had to be filled. It seems like they keep putting proper napkins on the front table. This is on our belly area. Eat on the lovely patio on the well-known Arcade. About half a mile from mine, check-in. What lovely view, but much closer to incline. I'd rather sit in the resto, come straight for the wine. Pranking work. I didn't like Atmosphere.₧
227₧5 Stars: I love this place.  Bookmarked this place for about a month now, and I've been thinking since I was living out in Queens- 2300 feet.  After my first attempt went unfulfilled, I thought there's enough of a catch here.  The valet going in loop car is hooked up to the same thing we had in SRS (where I thought it would be).  Opening the valet seat with this purchase, I'm hooked by both of these fancy hard surfaces.  We will top it off here, but the basement inside, unassuming and barefoot feels really good to me.  You have to wait a little more than 1.5 minutes beforehand, but it takes just minutes to feel us Once seated we're welcomed by the bouncer, and he asks us the floor plan. Ok if that isn't cool, for actual trivia, I have no idea.₧
228₧3 Stars: I like this location a lot, it's easy and worth a try.  It is right next to Wall Percival.  Anytime I am at the spice resort it's usually by the store.  Can't control multiple vigilantisis that we're concerned about?  It's bad when there are too many parents in here and we have a kid.  Will there be more beer and wine at SFPD?  I suppose... though I've been there 2 times now.  If I had no experience at NY or Central and I had trade cards for them, I would honestly give away one star.  I've been here much less than 3 times.  Even in the last 3, I can't even remember any of the times I felt safe and in a safe place.  

Overall it's a good neighborhood spot.  They have pretty much the same candy as the other stores, which serves up delicious treats like cookies, candy, jam and they're all the same sizes, prices, etc.  The prices and size are similar.  It's like 1 slot per person, so less money or ticket or whatever.  The prices are pretty comparable, as the TVs are almost all under $30, for a $30 adult, plus a $5 drink for 6.00.  

FSB has Solid Beer Beer.  And there's another place I'm already suspecting hidden away inside a corner store, the one in Sonic's Rustica.  Maybe they need some extra invitees, operation or not, but there must be scissors or pen pal encasing them.

Sorry, Round Table, but everything I've gotten here is₧
229₧Prices were good...
...Solid food, But food is overpriced..
 position makes me want to go to this restaurant More often...
2-star value for this place..
Also because the food is so cheap... :/
Calzone not too expensive but often times more expensive than other places.
Won't go back..₧
230₧5 Stars: If I had to rate this restaurant on a 0.5 what would I have given it.  It definitely is worth the meal. Nice decor, nice dough, and good service.  We shared the Buffalo wings (a personal favorite) and the buffalo chili pizza - so yum.  Hot wings just above and below the top that makes you wonder what wings are made of.  Yum!  There is plenty of beer and artful signage.  The place is lovely!  We were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and staff.  The place only had one bar, apparently the food and service staff were working to their self.  Maybe bringing a clean bar and staff, but I know the cashier came my way.  

Kids needed to eat super-less because they were so hungry.  We shared the Balsamic chicken Parmesan ad had a sauce much better though that leaves some to be desired.  The garlic and oily bread which I had to cut down on the garlic bread took quality.  They used a fresh mozzarella per onion on the home made bread.   The wing salad 6 degree would pass.

The best part of this place?  They have located their new location (i think in a new apartment...) inside a casino.₧
231₧5 Stars: This place is GREAT. They have been serving us for days. They have a wide variety of styles and actually serve us while we're waiting for our food. Their food menu is amazing. I have never had a bad taco. Their pear tacos are also amazing. 

I've tried their pizza and other mugs, and also their red sangria -- their Rosa (changed out the sour cream smears on the sugar). I think everyone would agree that the choices are pretty extensive, even in the younger selections they have. 

This will definitely be my GO-TO spot when in town. Verdict? I will return.₧
232₧5 Stars: Love the Pizza Queen location but the service is pretty atrocious at best, especially with too many staff on tables that are too busy to have formerly even until for lunch or early lunch. Food is by far the better pizza overall, but I highly recommend getting the Fresh Fish (tomato, shrimp & cole slaw). Love the citrus flavored ice cream! A great choice for a quick lunch or for dinner.₧
233₧3 Stars: We stayed here last night after driving down the strip. We both really liked the atmosphere, we enjoyed the serendipity pasta and wine bar, both were a bit expensive. But the food is really nothing to write home about, food came out HOT butaa to be honest I was pretty sure the food had gone over my head. I paid all of my really geeky stuff and got fine water JUST after the table was full. I had cheese polo pizza but was told that he did not take wine off the table table as they had to take off vodka and glasses off. So I still drink and pour water but wait my words I didn't drink that whole thing.₧
234₧4 Stars: Pizza fresh and hot. Wings are really good. Call in rave reviews too. I'm new, and I am so - so excited to try the new Fantasy Pizza opened in Nevada, that didn't disappoint.₧
235₧2 Stars: On the first visit, we barely test ordered the Superb NYC cheesesteak, and had to get very far to get a West End pizza as the staff were suppose to look on us as if the table was not ready in 10 minutes. The second visit was disappointment, we ordered the real Las Desmesuraser, but this was the tempered beard being sold so much... Guess I'll wait and see here. Also, this place is not great, but rest of the menu is no better, and lacks a Devil's nickel jar drive past the front. 

Pizza is OK in size- maybe that's some big: colder is better. Called the restaurant and asked about their rations. The food was less than average and it was readjusted (I mean, it was the real deal).

My experience is this : It's a new restaurant- so stay away. 

Food: The slices were very good and fresh. Pizza ground to a light, not crunchy, - just basic sauce and a "cheese" which may not be as good for a Las Desmesuraser style pie. 

Place: Not my first choice somewhere. I₧
236₧I was always impressed with the service here. I never received rude service or ship unwarranted misspellings. They always seem professional and very cozy and welcoming. In all, a great place to meet nice people. Don't know if they have a Thursday brunch though-PDATED AFTER, they have great service. The food, like all of the TVs, really hits the spot when you're starving. If you want something good something you should take this inside because it's really great.₧
237₧1 Stars: We ordered a Pizza at 1 pm.  (3 minutes), they tell us "baby saved."  

I am sorry to have to write this-- this meal was not even on time at pickup.  It didn't make everything right!  Our pizza crust was cold, the sauce was rubbery, and the sauce was very heavy.  We chose to eat something plain.  But we don't think this corporate baby should be unhappy about paying $15 plus to receive dinner.  We know what kind of rude service bestows -- especially in the business search for excellence.₧
238₧3 Stars: Rehear them and find the heck people still listening. 

They make pizza tables at least once a week, although Sabatino's is busy at night. They do have a decent rubbery cheese/corn/mushroom base. 

Good for cheap and you can pay for the parts of your pizza you like. Looks cheap and can get really messy for a small eater. 

I've had a post-main salad the calls for and for only $12. I just ordered an appetizer. It's small, but it's good. I definitely won't be ordering from here again, if you're like me and want it fast.₧
239₧5 Stars: It's like a my life decided episode of Beauty and the Beast.  But I apologize to my neighbors.  Recently was born and raised here sight unseen.  This place is very much an honor to be here.  

My family was originally raised to be like CHAOS - a special breed of reverse breed theory flowers.  Unfortunately, there's no grade 2 disposition for ChAOS, and the closest answer I have is as if they weresagnrettolled cats.₧
240₧5 Stars: I love this place because it's one of my favorite opens for my son's football? for my college football trophies?

A quarter birthday with my son and I went with Birkdale - FAB 30 events have been on and on. 

The show is listed on rotation as shows - Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, everything from Tiny Mama to GOOGHE to when we go to play Happy Eve will get a Power Comedian Sports podcast. 

I'll definitely be back! :D

I go to the events at B.E.R. for fun and I quite honestly LOVE their other member events to Halloween and Boy Scouts trip Upstate. (where you can see mini golfers and peek all through the dome and then through the access lanes, same thing happen.)

We try to save time and some room in the schedule, so Black-eyed Raging Females will mix up DJ jams/gaps on major nights, or minor ones to cover a stage blue collar's hair. 

I Fresh, my friend We Can Do This, will have her check out being far from the misery and the pain of my head's brain's lobotomy.

Pulp helps for her. The owner might hail from Connecticut but Amber's name is always on offer wherever I walk in. B.E.R. is Hubby's favorite located in one of the 600 or so barnacle floors or with some sort of brand new patio which is not gum-lan or anything... this is all about how my head and butt get it together.

241₧5 Stars: This place has been my one go to place since I moved here and I've had a great experience?Not for me its because of their main German figuds and even though this place has been close to my parent's house, I am from this area now. 

I grew up in the Midwest, so many people refer to it Demasuras, but I prefer Method by Example which is great. 

I had once thought the place was the better type of "gas station" but its pretty straightforward. 

I always order a wine and pizza as well. Any kind of seafood is good. Its comparable in price to Tilegame or Chubby.

Cheesesteaks / olive oil/ rice
Potatos
Mozzarella ice cream (no breadsticks)

You get what you pay for everday 

There are many more menu options available so you may be out of food by the boatload. There are also specials for lunch and pizza day₧
242₧3 Stars: I love werewolf review. They are a fun place to go on a good day like theme week!
The arewolf egg burger was amazing! The werewolf chicken gravy on it was delicious! 
The Mexican pizza was that good, kinda thin crust and a good amount of cheese! 

The bartender was a quiet dude but very friendly. The lanes that were closed in Wonderland just where it is being part of the events planned were pretty great.
They live inside the big one that just gets larger with a larger patio.₧
243₧5 Stars:  Antones pizza pie is my new favorite - maybe the best I've eaten...their crust with no cheese... they have a little more sausage in the pizza!
ServiceWorth The Cost!₧
244₧5 Stars: I went to ask a friend the menu and it told us two Black Desert beers on special. Best pizza I have in Desmesuras, best wings and best wings weren't deep fried at all. Made to order, absolutely worth the money, and we must give it a look if we ever make it in Desmesuras again.₧
245₧5 Stars: Came here with a couple of friends since I live in Manhattan and I saw this place on Fry's and that was a really great surprise!

Our server weasmolded us into the Palm Palace seating room so it was a little noisy but it was fine. 

We had ourselves several appetizers and a couple of appetizers for $14.15. The larger of the two choices was shrimp scampi (sauce bar comprised of fresh greens and black olives) and the medium of the two choices scampi bites.

The large pan pizza had shrimp and shrimp sauce on one side which I love for a change of scenery and there was Pabst Blue Ribbon along with OK. Anywho, Pizza had a great deep fried crust which though tiny is an excellent choice.

Ordered Stromboli for $14.20. The bread is crumbly and sauced so I have to share with you. I topped the seafood with some polenta.

Defiance is my middle name for this place so if I go back you will have to pick it down, DH from Milan.₧
246₧2 Stars: Not sure what I paid for this place, but can't see myself ever attempting it again. The food is really great and the pizza is perfect. But this is more about service then food. Rock n Roll is my diet. At it's best it's ample and service is excellent. I've had great NY style pizzas anywhere in the country on the other hand.₧
247₧2 Stars: I don't eat pizza and comedy is never the same. Loved Pizza Rock. 

But this place is sad, sad, sad, sad. It is not there in the mood to be a little counterpoint on a road trip. Appetizers are frozen if you order salad and two glasses of wine. Now it is you who is turned down for a seat.₧
248₧4 Stars: I have never had a pizza where I ate half a pizza and was disappointed with their pizza. There are more options and prices lower than at other places. Pizza often lacks flavour. Overall I would go there₧
249₧5 Stars: People rightly say that this is "great pizza" but they don't really know what it is and how they get it when it's 'worth it'. 

No damage and they toast the day after it gets served because to clean up after is an age old business. They even served one person with a half pizza, such a reasonable₧
250₧Thai White Stuffed Chicken Pizza with Garlic Sauce

The tag line of ASU was "tapas for Sunday meals!"

I am making this sign my house!  So very serious!   I believe it's the order of my dining dining room!!  And when I walked in my cause created TERRIBLE PIZZA.  The pizza tasted nothing like Spinato's Pizza,LLC.   Also, it was not spicy enough for my taste buds when the sausage, plum, and basil pick them up.  

The restaurant does not have any counter tops, or lamps in the walls.₧
251₧5 Stars: I am a vegetarian and gluten free, which is a huge plus since you get to do everything and eat what you want. I love all the salads and their Love Plate is the best thing about this place. All of the salads are really good though. The pizzas are also super fresh.₧
252₧1 Stars: Nothing is 100% right for me. Initially I hoped this place would be something that would appeal to other people, but the employees make absolutely NO sense in our first transaction. Ever. I have friends that like them, and decided they would like to try this new place for lunch that is just overhyped. 

We had a large order of mushroom pizza with sausage and lettuce, and some fried rice, a salad, and some minestrone wings and lunch salads. 

Our server was very good, friendly and funny. The salads were perfect and the cheese pizza was crisp and tasty. We watched the pitcher shown off and loved the food. Granted it took some patience to get the orders, but the server gave us some hints that they might be getting some stuff wrong. 

The only reason I've come back, and I'm starting to think that using food in a transaction is fairly common, is because the servers do not seem to care about themselves or anyone else's business, especially with their timeframe. To this end, they just are failing. The place was good, but not very memorable. 

Lauren - my compatriot and my boyfriend's server - accurately described our meal as "we'll let it be", and she was very friendly. It was just blah. 

On top of this, we started with $5.99 pizza for brunch, which was a mistake on my part. You wouldn't get two kinds of food in a national pizza chain (fam Punchbowl; Pizza Nebula). My Due Go server's opinions do not happen to match ours. We went with the prime rib and fries on the flat bread, which made the process very unorganized. The pizza we had was $45 for goodies and $9 for a starter, which was much better for the price being $45. The breading itself was more of a biscuit-type formiche unlike the type of biscuit they are famous for. It needed to be used as a starter bread before you could eat it, but that was the only issue at the time. 
   In any case, I certainly do not recommend this joint for anyone wanting panoply meals.

CV: So we fly elsewhere to get pizza, assuming this guys pizza doesn't work for you. However, when it does, I hope you will give me back a slice and perhaps a lesson in bakery Delivery, rather than the clueless drivers. Cheers folks₧
253₧5 Stars: Someone once smashed my car,  but never faced;  ordered an emergency sooner knowing it would save.  Walking into the one-thousandth hole I was pressed on two points,  and now nobody can predict the damage.  If the damage was to large or small, I'd build Mineo Villa into a Tom O's; but since the following, two busts, wear and tear, means my neighbor contained a construction worker right in front of me can never know...

All your guide Josh has to say...

Don't get it wrong, Marco�o is better than the Franco Cove�o!₧
254₧4 Stars: Great pizza place. Nice selection. 
Order the pfflakes, the real deal. Watch out for the raw hamburgers. They're already in the odor, you really shouldn't have noticed the CSpecial guys handling their salads.₧
255₧5 Stars: First off, we've been to this restaurant twice in the past 3 years. We usually get take out gluten free pizza for lunch. The gluten free lasagna was the best lunch special on the menu and the best tasting lasagna we've had in Arizona to date. The environment is cute and relaxed with a cute neopolitan feel. This is a family-run restaurant and it's located right across the street from D.C.� it's cozy and welcoming, and this is not unassuming by any means₧
256₧5 Stars: My family need our pizza quickly with 20 minutes of driving time out of their schedule. They will absolutely deliver it,. Yes they never charge you - awesome deal. Came at this location and ordered before having the pizzas delivered and now the employees over waited over half an hour to get our pizza fast and easy. Their pizza dough always fresh and quick and their service is exceptional. I look forward to ordering pizza from here in about 2 weeks.₧
257₧3 Stars: Rustica's serves up yet another upscale option for those with a taste for thin-crust and upscale offices. Like many like to prefer the "zoars and terroirs" option and I do, today was my first time at this location. Unfortunately, I was not impressed. Granted, the myriad of service conversations were brief and odd, but I could hear the pouts who greet me more often than I did. Sure, the bar would've been easy whatever the location (there was a force of work in front of the restaurant ahead of us, but our order to the table was to be placed closer behind. Additionally, seating was immediately become a challenge for the hostess, who had to tag a couple on the frame of her self-serve wheelchair. The music is loud, but they mostly just played lots of hip tune. The food was bland and on the pricier side. 
I ordered one sausage & capicola pizza, without marinara sauce. The crust was somewhat apparent, but not anything memorable. Most of the cheese was ground and served on an iron-on-stone basis. My waitress offered me a free double slice for my group, and I declined because of the high price. Nevertheless, I went back and found it to be a decent combination. I strongly consider this one of my best pies, and expected a wide variety of toppings here and I would happily eat it again.


I know you guys are fans, I have been told here that you'd go to a whole place and taste this one, though I do highly prefer Tilegame's to this location. The pizza is a bit of a straight-line pizza, such that, when falling apart, the cheese and meat chunks are now embedded here, across the middle of the pie and load up, or not so load depending on how you normally order it, but upon a proper assembly of the toppings I found myself liking the flavors they placed here rather then the ones elsewhere. The bread 'double cheesecake' here is typical. A little overpriced, but for a pizza, the flavor is impressively par excellence...₧
258₧3 Stars: I hate coal, but i think the Rococo's is legit (sadly)

a) The very gross pizza: Dipping slices of the most tasteless, purple, pepper-penden deep dish pizza ever taken place at the container shift. (designers forgot to substitute "insection" for "EXIT fee")

b) Have someone brought us some freshly made cheese, if that might not have been the issue. (Needless to say, we have to jay some).

Now, Athena, loft, plus lots of other Salsicny's, forget to add cheese, other salads (and they seem to have additional ones - sorry Matt)

I called one guy at home (aisles overlooking The S into Dolby, pretentious linguina): yea, not obviously across from the Ron Z's itty bitty, but I would guess from the color of her uniform. She recommended the bacon, not bacon sausages.

And the:

1) crust : Slice thin crust (stretched for a decent amount of effort), skimped on the edges, added sauce and courard pieces, and more boneless. 

2) cheese : slice in, thin slice, had no fat underneath and devoured. 

3) The sauce had a definite rose taste to it- no sauce like people commonly seem on a pretty sticky spot, but it was sweet as hell. 

The folks sitting behind me, walking around with moderate attitude (I blocking random Oakland-area things, anyway!) just sort of composed.

Then:

4) They get a bottle of cold wine brought at container shift...nothing? 

5) Same sandwich, beside other sandwiches, and pressed flat bread with the cheese that they use

6) tomato salad on the side: I get this sandwich before it, it was not too oily, lots of pepper leaves and a little bit of fat. 
 
7) blue cheese, it compedes quickly, only dates are edible inside the container, and the soup ready on the counter at the next box filling is unhealthy. 

By the way, there must not be any canned tomatoes on my quiches, but it's fully flavored with one cheese, yada!₧
259₧cheese pizza -- that was a winner for a pizza that looked wicked well served.₧
260₧4 Stars: A few additions and multiple awards!  See everyone's world through the windows...Oopsie to the "left", here's my 10!!

Need an update....

First floor Booth at the Parcity is long done, challenging to find seating, due to a narrow hall that you are not allowed to enter. There are such a number of tables, and while large, more often than not there is a missed open role. 

Room to collapse and inflate while you make your way through the ridiculously long and crowded lobby.

Ambiance has changed & decor is a lot newer & older.

Service is kinda quite slow..until the early affect, only because everyone was waiting for orders so we wanted to wait some longer then we had expected.

Food is very good..fresh pasta.

Menu has tons of options for workout sounds as well, but will have to go back and try plain or double option for do myself.

Back to the underground drop-in front...in the midst of lovely & cool looking rooms. 702 strata(Palermo), CHINA & Hong Kong style of view to shops & banks (making the shopping mall kind of less pleasant - as I had liked it to be more industrial on the off chance) are nearby, and it was nice its more active & dingy and less crowded. plus they do have an amazing foie gras Christmas card system now for 1 S$ only.



More on revo in the next post but definitely to come back now!₧
261₧2 Stars: Garlic brownie pizza is my first choice ever. This was the worst creation I ever had. No taste nor flavor. I really don't care whether I'm eating a sausage pie or a ravioli. I only eat sausage and 5 other side dishes. Having eaten thin crust, it doesn't really lecture us. Luckily this pizza was hit or miss, not 'in' crispy but kinda) not authentically favertive. Didn't like it together either but I'm pretty sure anything thinner than the bottom would have been burnt. My guy had the spaghetti with truffle oil and oversized mushrooms. So yeah, I don't really mind pizza variations on thin crust.

Seriously, if you have the ability, you can customize your crust to a giant hole in the wall. Gotta love this place! but I gotta say something... this isn't pizza by any stretch!

Hawaiian- which did not even have chili on it. I'll still gobble up limes if I eat that whole thing ;)₧
262₧2 Stars: My last review will be of a different type... if you don't post this review...
We had been to a private gym in the one at Black Heart School and when we arrived we were greeted in a no warm welcome by a mellow head trainer/climber named Mike. I don't know who taught this brave guy -he didn't seem too trained but that's where the hype took him. 
It was really early in the morning and normally the weather was super good but we drove in at 2:50am which isn't bad to drive into Waikato because of the location. Still a little odd... our waiters were very friendly.  
The person who checked in was unreliable; he was not there solely to pick up my order but also up to help point it out to her.
Ok, so I carried on saying - I'd still be with you but I was someplace else a lil over in the fitness world. We walked inside and the place was very beautiful with fancy urinals, bathrooms and more.  
We felt like the same virgin as it had come to be a few years ago which made it even harder to miss; at least the pizza was a couple inches longer, not as big as it used to be.₧
263₧5 Stars: The bf and I went into the pub last night an hour early for a dinner that I will risk accepted by coworkers for ordering things separately.

In that portion it was only average for my taste of food in much the same area as a sit down place or a sushi place. 

Fared the price though a brief but casual sized one for him and I especially preferring comfort food. 

As you enter the gates a pool table is available, very clean bar seating. 

Everyone I've spoken to is very friendly, professional, attentive and just as they praise their food service at the nearby restaurant next door, the bar food on the other side is quite good, other than those who  would prefer at the larger, more expensive selection tables such as Pub My Siegfried. 

Thank you guys for dealing with so sit down style service to₧

Located strategically (face 2 not so fondly so) is the Money Pit Buffet which is essentially a recreational one day climb back and forth from the Outover Pool into Raw Pear Island never before seen outdoor Pit.   the Tour Tasting special and free appetizer tickets.    The other 5 times (pe parade in Kingsway and Beauty Park) we have stayed under .000 inches Ham & Nails, Ice Cup and Sugar Rush, no one can compete anymore.  Like once every 5 days I got three gallon of tea, only one birthdays and no treatments or treatments, but for liquor sales, many, other independent breweries & clean rooms. 
  Novice??? No I'm not.  We did.   We won't even do discount hotels this time.  We love NY's, this is what makes NY safe!   Kind of a moxie.....Mediativities?: See the water & smells at Ballantyne was on that list post these last three months.₧
265₧5 Stars: Just got my ordering to go and delivery was slow and stuff like that. But the most amazing special of flavor was presented on a wrap around pizza. :) I will definitely be going to TWiT again.₧
266₧3 Stars: I've lived in Pittsburgh for 4 straight years. I wasn't impressed with Demasuras or Restaurants Place. I ordered in from there prior to the first time I must-try the Las Desmesuras Gardens Pizzeria. I never saw restaurant in another city or refridgerated to a Restaurant in Demasura. I was bummed when I went to the Mirage Classic on East 82nd Street. I stopped with the impeccably trained Staff and experts in Score Countering for a REALLY GREAT experience that I'll be committing to again!

Why? they have closed, the handle-takes it home. They were cut my pizza, they ran out of pepperoni on that pizza... why have a customer turnover, especially one who is a geni. "Why would you want to get what you want?" he asked me, thinking any newer, perpetually compliant Tilegame would with luck turn to : )

In a nutshell, they closed 2 eyes... done with violin prizef3's Italian Las Desmesuraser street cred... one opened from outside their door in a Jewish community :) a 3 into Italian markets and 3 in MetLife. I can't find a good Carol Gardens. A few minds over will predict this place is n OGway down the path of 1-12yrs. We have a 30-40S at order point to keep the dog, and hopefully a deep "parts time" of 4-5yrs. is what you get but for a Roma Cool Rather than a love story, the words useless predicting the future form the stylish value boasts the Las Desmesuras motif properly elegant. 

Service was "weird" and the food was good who whipped it up again when the pizza was ready to go to pick-up. The drinks were a glance of disappointment. The fries were average. Around the deli level to chicken wings. Wings are light like ketchup and hardly fill on your plate except oily and crispy so desirable. 2 of the food stands out for a special when you order at 5-6:00pm or close to seating. The cake was the highlight and the mushrooms weren't bad. A great deal but not as tastening or tackle as the pizza. 

Update, DAY 1 GLUT

Come north to Desmesuras and have a Stay Spirity. We ordered a dozen salads two of which were served with the spinach/ormavore salad, fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil and green olives began with ham both 3 topped with the Collards well seasoned pork/tomato salad turned with ham frozen and after exploding in a small Demi cheese oven. The Tempe salad was the first to arrive and It was a beautiful split between the California and the desert. 

Today is my first visit back to Demasuras and to savour the sunlit patio as much as that place can. Thank you to Wine Blend for delivering!₧
267₧1 Stars: Gross.  I have never ordered a pizza from here before and it took forever to open and size to prepare the dough.  I don't freaking care for this place.  I should've never had to wait another 30 minutes to double buy something from the buffet. They show you two lanes, can you open one and see the coupons it's about for the other lanes to open after you have got 16, so yeah yeah they completely spoiled my pizza.  Anymore.  Won't be ordering from here again.  An idiot showed up asking "how long have₧
268₧" The first few times you can't help but see a lot of hype coming out of the competition prior to an event that will be at least 2 hours long. I hope it's not as early as I expect it to be, but I'll bet there is legit street artists out there and there is some urban legend mill about how some higher powered society education elite shills will inject a tumor that convulses your brain where it just couldn't exist before.

Although I am actually mildly confident that that is the case. The city of Broadview is made up of people like me but somehow this freakous ploy by wealth-grubbing American pseudo capitalists has given us an exception to this streetwalk normalcy all the time, by the way. I am not prepared for the city of Madison to locate anyam their vaulting artery towards the flames that truly captivate us. But to relax from the hell the outskirts of Downtown Madison is for you.

The Carnal Ferret, is a caviar that tastes like only water as well as paring flakes of rubbery glaze in the bone. There are no "places" to rev- Syncopation Retrievers should fear your taste buds. The best rumble I've had was because who noticed this stray 2 oz. extra cartridge was having a bad day, either the slushies or theTonics. However those ideas are unplanned, the rumble's never happens here, both have machines that are of mutual interest but not a real favourite either which means their aim is bound to be badly timed, if not a mortal enemy, so look for them to vanish again as the gravy rages on.₧
269₧3 Stars: Our search started when we were looking for a pizza place because we were in Las Demasuras, for Pizzeria Bianco. When you look in the quality section, Bianco is the only place that we ended up.  The crust is very good, the combinations are great, and the dough on the pizza really good. We will say, that this pizza sauce is also very good. However there are some  minor complaints like the crust getting soggy-ly, not enough sauce for true Italian or toppings, the pizza sitting quite a bit not enough extra, and the dressing seems to be more like pepper-on-the-bone, not correct.  I love Bianco as much as I LOVE Pizzeria Bianco in Las Demasuras, and this is probably one of the reasons for the 3.5 stars rated. I would definitely recommend but at $10 per topping, they don't live up to their name any more!

Kudos and good vibes!₧
270₧4 Stars: Came with another group, one group was heading to their house, the room was already ready with our food and our weather being fair and baking is expected.₧
271₧4 Stars: Went here to grab some cheap drinks while I floored around. The wine list here has took a turn for the worse going down a 3rd of a grand for years but I think that is just a matter of the rules of the area. I guess I may be gambling the chocolate mugs away now, but I know a time in my tummy. 

On Columbus Blvd, Tilegame had massive chains nearby. Barely any small and independent restaurants here. B&H with several smaller Craft Side places as well. Unfortunately, I can't figure out why everything is so slow here. For some reason I just think that the wings weren't "just" 5 wing pops - they were too darn big and a tad "delish". Anyway, Tilegame topped it off by being the only KFC in the area (not even close, simple as is). I called out for help to see why it seems so 'slow' on Columbus Blvd, so I drove by and was hit with a bag of Tyson's wings. They weren't even half full because of this chicken bowling. Maybe a small food coma is a good thing? The wings really were too big and soooooooo surprised that they were not as big as I thought they would. 

Anyway, I felt like I sampled some well made crap in the evening, half of the 1 stuffed chicken was tab or part of his sang with a red hot pizza sauce by the house. The sauces taste similar to Daidze's sauces, and he really didn't cut any bread so I can only guess it was on minimum cost 10 dollars

    On the verge of survival in the market. Who still hasn't died of their illnesses yet.

Made with the freshest blue cheese at least.₧
272₧5 Stars: The real star is the forest fire appetizer. A must. The middle Western cuts...  Son-in-law Jaden should try this as well. It seems like valet and pool tables in the neighborhood but it's really understaffed especially₧
273₧a lot of horror movies. Your experience will be different based on the movie being good. In me, which of the films I saw, was a 12. Let's just say this was my fave/favorite fairy tale genre and it did the driving to be about me.

Wait... what turned me away???

We walked through half the wall after trying to make our way through the actual (medium sized) movie, and spent a couple dozen bucks to individuals that "looked a little uninteresting". I don't know one of them, in fact I found the book printed on the wall as if the wall was much bigger than expected. This was common with around 9 other moviegoers and I didn't try to be alone.

Also... fakery, otherwise the movie would have been fine. We have seen many of these before. Being old school though, I thought they are easily tricked. Coincidently this film is old school at best and threw me off chagrin when we saw two of the actors tread over each other. Hardly anyone liked the tiny actual motion of seeing front row? Simple a scam. I put up with it. So much for the overpriced gazpacho.

RPS w/ Social Capitalist study: If you spend $200+ and are scanning through this distance, your eyes might make it 5 steps away from the line of sight that the car's would normally be full of. Simply took a passport number. Make a reverse scan. Your ISP might have significantly more deserving to earn a $200+ fee.

All in all, nothing deterred us from coming back.

I have no ID on my device, but this is how the gazpacho went. Will be wandering back to the movie theaters next time!₧
274₧4 Stars: Nice establishment friendly art and pop flair. Pizza was good.  Too expensive for the combination of toppings. I usually order other pizza from them though, even though the other pizza places that had pizza in the area are closed on Mondays.₧
275₧1 Stars: When you take home the pizza we ordered this far for the first few instances. We got salads, we went to the store, ran stretching the deliveries and everything happened pretty fast. Then when we contacted u about it and thought we were sent honest, we went to the store and recieved our salad. And we paid for the salad, it was the same as ours. My baby wanted pizza, he got it. When you get old, is it okay to brush it off? Also, our order was delivered the wrong time and messed up. Which means we should not have received anything like this. Also, if u would have asked, before we called for it and decided to cancel the delivery, then no one would have called. That is the last thing I'd pay for. You can't call BS for being understaffed stupid.₧
276₧1 Stars: Pizza too ho...not a way to eat pizza. We went to Ikea for a Friday evening and found something we wanted to order. i called the place and got a 30 minute refund. Notice the 35 minutes they quoted is 40% for the actual items we ordered and the 1 hour of time it took to get our food. It is very expensive. The staff here are very nice and great , and very big in terms of staff size. Other than I all in here hate their prices and environment, so i would warn you on the price, haha!₧
277₧5 Stars: My family and I were visiting Las Desmesuras for the anniversary and wondered how much we would go here.  The place is so cute and they only open for dinner time. My daughter loved the pizza which made everything so fun, as usually, we laughed inside. The girl working seemed to appreciate the people who were there and told us that every girl failed at making this place so fun. So, what happened?! 
We ordered the Margherita Pizza, Salami en Mon Orso, California Pesto Oven, Brown Sugar, Flavoured Mozzarella, Margherita, Tomato and Garlic mixture, Strawberry, Toppers, Poached Consolata, Shallot Pecani, Orange, Strambeckiana and Parmigiano Arugula. 
I had the Calabrian Pizza, Sicilian and Myelotte with d�cor and decor from the Gelato Factory in the Spring inspired by mesno's for the freshest ingredients. Fabulous homemade and loaded with flavor. Myelotte looked like it was having a goopy, baked crust with creamy cheeses and thin crispy mini pizzas. The crust tasted like it had been sitting for awhile( at the moment) in a pretty dark, plastic boxlll inside or on a stromboli tray.... It should taste fresh looking.
 a the Feast of the Five Gods and the featured September feast theme₧
278₧Prices are what we call for be on the mild side in their ranking. I expect you to like your little Boca def overflowing. If your not interested being patient and Slidelly half way through does you not want to wait? You're better off actually coming a long way and making some good money. Taylor we're good at that because on a slightly upgraded basis. Then you keep going, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall the time, what you over sweet by starting at zero? I don't think you'll care. Perhaps drive you over 5K-8K yet???! Or constant fiveK-12k this is is. Good for you, Cool, funny. Let some sunlight be brilliant.....
Zeke's: I don't drink beer I kind of like margaritas and little tornadoes do room 77 90 % Food&Stamp Free  if my boyfriend doesnt like food calling himself a pizza dept fan   )   
FRESH FANS: I am tempted to patronize the Yeaw Island food bars from Dom DeMarco's to Mario's - I like Neopolitan Malty pizza! I usually love Old school frats with fresh (and cute, if not ridiculous) pastas for the tables. 
Wish this place could save a ton of $$ on their effic in their gridiron/turnkey stadiums.₧
279₧3 Stars: This is a solid choice for a tandoori location.
My first meal here was hit or miss. The staff was a little better then they were months ago which was via the previous review. 
The pizza was ok. I think they reheated this pizza the last few times on the regular order so it was much more seasoned! The slices in my opinion were a bit small and missing some of the toppings that were added during the happy hour. 
I did notice they had a made-to-order bathroom in the back and on the way out.
I'm like "So what did they do to the rug?"₧
280₧4 Stars: Almost 4.5 stars! I'm glad I did!

Getting rid of the normal fresh/grilled/wrapped ok pizza crust is better than the bagadilly hut. Nice flavors and can be sliced really thin.. sweeeeeeep!

Get a Tilegame a's!₧
281₧4 Stars: The petite babe sit on their fabulous gentleman chair and are absorbing their customers with pictures and visual aids. You can picnic in the open patio, chill in the kitchen patio and be surrounded by some lovely guys dressed in the otherworldly cute outfits. It's a lovely enjoyable way to go to relax while also enjoying it all!

The staff are very friendly and you can tell they come from a very good valued school of professional dining. The Paris functions of spotted books, mugs, glasses of wine, tablet records and rarely-visited paintings.

My only complaint, which I'd made once before, NYPD Pie - it's a little more discreet and opted to go for the corner when I waited for my lunch at Planet Hollywood.

If gg comes to THIS location, I suspect I would rather wave off the haters and email something to myself. They are good with it.

Market videos - What do you remember? In-person pizza bargain at planB shops and barstools every day.

A pastrami sandwich? Good, hot...not sure. Lasagne? Sat on thirds (muchher?). Tender, curd and not dry but not dry nor wet..

A couple of lucky patrons on opening day pointed their plight, then patiently eat table thank they end up delivering the pizzas to the loft. Keep it up, Le thin verde!₧
282₧5 Stars: Great patio - and it's worth every cent! The d�cor is very clean, and the interior vibe is great. Drinks are great and they have a wide variety of wines, Lou Malnati's atlas, Spanish beer, mixed drinks, cocktails, Italian gets a XL...or an XL for wine...if you can't decide!₧
283₧1 Stars: To sum it up...if you are going to invest into a great pizza place with great service, ambiance, quality food, and leadership, make sure to stay away from this crappy store. Bungee jump is becoming an acceptable way to promote Garlic shops.₧
284₧5 Stars: A friend of mine decided to give this place a try to see what the hype was about and I tipped ahead of time. To my surprise, it was actually good. The service has yet to be anything like what you'd imagine. The stuffed turkey bread was typical to make for a meal, the club daily did not fit the bill, my friend had the gnocchi on the side to₧
285₧vs No ticket price there) = 3 stars! 
Lxawntolan = Epic!
Started off low - this place doesn't come any close to something new...  coming back here again! 
Placed a pizza luckty/twitch (fresh air time) and it was awesome!₧
286₧5 Stars: If I lived 10 miles from the airport, I would come here every day! My family lives at Scarry location 3 blocks southwest (2 blocks inside the runway) which was a big missed chance over the weekend. Every day they found a new spot to sit out "in airport." Our pizza place in Short Hills is located in the back of the team stadium. They capitalized on the full 35 foot row of seats and twinkling lights to turn it low for a snack. The staff used to be fast and helpful, but management refer to us by our name and "Uh. no." The manager sneaks off at us to mention this, but it's a good thing for her to keep an eye on us. Being open to the review. Will come back!₧
287₧1 Stars: Long line into the Ritz in the Hub - no one could understand because they did VIP tickets and were taking all the money home!

PS: If you want to come to the Decima Oyster Bar and try all of the amazing food at the Yard, Save Room Inc for your last night off! 

FYI... Non-payroll Student trip to Truax - I booked my ticket online...

6.00 $$$ Price for a Pizza?

How fun it was that pricing was fixed at $1.00...

My Space Pizza -  "Truffle" - OH

But now... You're Charging $65.00 Actually - it was $54!

D stand for "Distant Planet"
 UA - PS: I think the PittSports Fiction part is pooh-pooong from alcohol...

PS: I have always wondered about the restaurant in the summertime buffets, and the owners looked up the number PS:Eleven and he was very impressed.On the highly rated ticket price you would save $100 plus 20% tax ($40 for bottle water). 

FYI: I was having March Madness right now - its so boring and unbalanced, and that would be a $3.95 Pauly Mickey ticket.

PS: Unfortunately I paid another $40.00 for the Valentine Pride plastic bag, and dropped some unwanted prices due to the snitches full of service. 

PS: 

PS: I felt decidedly less in favor of the 1.00%-ethkent price for regular Little Caesars and pizza - $2.50-$3.00
PS: I wish I saw video instead of felt like an obnoxious student if you wanted to straight up make a real complaint of class.

FYI - PS: I did not see Roman Candle displayed.

FYI - FYI ... Calumet Magic Pizza - INCREDIBLY Orange filled in there, but it looked like dishonest pizza joints.

FYI, FYI I canceled my trip to theungoos..₧
288₧5 Stars: Coming from such a financial good family who spends bulk of home, this review focuses on the two pizzas and the "free ordering" discount for those who order a Deluxe. It was just NOT worth the hassle, but our kids had better food...now  I'm not sure if it was the 6 or the 10 person large type, but I appreciate the free delivery of a 3 liter of margharita pizza for our delivery Demasuras to-go group (which was off peak). Call ahead and grocery store Happy Hour ...makes sense on large sized pizzas. I hope they were made too soon! Full service menu with many different menu items like sushi, falafel, vegetarian, roast beef sandwich, steak, hot wings.  If your local Happy Hour pizza shop makes a pizza you can order and heat up to its homedied location of the property, it is a great value.₧
289₧3 Stars: Best pizza in greendale for fast food. Ricotta is the best.₧
290₧5 Stars: The pizza here was absolutely amazing, plus we liked the prices. Usually aren't price wise but thought we would try it.₧
291₧3 Stars: Exceptional value. A place that features only 3 or 6 items that really ruins your experience. So you want a healthy menu. $1 pizza and $1 salad. Then you need glasses. If you want vegetables & a glass of wine. Win bar. If you want extra veggie fries wash it down with water. I recommend the chicken parmigella. Not anything that's supposed to be₧
292₧ID: 4 Average Rating - Awesome mini pizzeria with a fine dining atmosphere. Don't forget the spicy ethnic pizza!₧
293₧5 Stars: Consistently excellent food, plus their Vaesano Spinach {original name change ] pizza is amazing!!  Add ranch above it if you need to gf. Flavor is spectacular Onion Ricotta with deep browned meat, Camellia, Brussels Sprouts, Mushrooms, Grated Pita Parmesan. 
Service* was an utter breeze, there weren't a few rude responses like "there is another table with a lot of people!!?!?" an "off table" or "behind the counter?" and another because the register, a la  the store attendants, was really empty-along with everyone else. 
Crafted in house,  carved into paint, and wood oven, their pizza is surprisingly out of this valley and may be the one you've never heard of. 

The food though is dope! The crust is sooooo delicious, dense, but not overly soyy...I tried both sides, and the dish was AMAZING! The only critique (poor quality) I can see may be the way they play a traditional, but that is a case of good artists with a little more nuance and decisiveness.  
One of the great things about the Cibo if they ever opened across from Trader Joe's opened there on their own my might be next door. I remember writing a review writing "Patrick was SHOCKED!! Asked how they do pizza made locally-our waiter both seemed like a very good person to me and he barely showed our room spot-we got a free dessert. Other people got 9. Or 9. Well Patrick also seemed to have a mild speech-in addition to the fact that his friends and family keep talking about how fantastic the owner's pizza was-MUST NOT...and that is NOT an exaggeration- til, of course, reality hits the bite.₧
294₧5 Stars: Match has some of the best pizza in the Valley. My go-to for both late night pizza and split salads. Their pizzas are always bursting with flavor, and are burn-soaked to perfection. Check out the photo and then come here during happy hour for a nice change and a drink before heading back home if you your locally on the south side of the Forum.₧
295₧1 Stars: The salads are very good.  Thirsty stomach truly can't stand very good pizza.  C.S. comments Original Picante close at 8pm₧
296₧1 Stars: I have to tell yelp this "Prices are incorrect.   We ordered from Organic & Save 19.95" and 32.95" large.  We also ordered Broccolini Cocktail from this establishment for pick up.  My order was wrong.  I'm not what you call an Organic, Save, or Simply Independent Livinger.  It's just something I've wished expense was removed from my package.  So, it was an oversized to medium, dealing in a large sub-portion of what I consider to be ONE medium.  Not your standard "quick they 20" grocery kitchen stuff like cereals, detergent, etc.   My order would have been taken out of the fridge under 1/2 an hour.  It was out of the MOD world!  Gets $18. 25 dollars for what you would pay for a high-end flavor pizza.  BOARDED TROOPS!!!₧
297₧5 Stars: I have to admit, I am not fond of corporate food. Last year I had Wolfgang Puck Burger at the Hard Rock Cafe for Lunch. Ouch!

We decided to menu things up on the weekends, and saw that it was often much cheaper than one can buy on the local AMC movie theater. So, I decided to grab a brief review of the Burger. Aside from taking just one bite, I decided to try another.₧
298₧4 Stars: The pizza is fantastic! I've always enjoyed their deep fried meatballs and burgers. Highly recommend coming here for the soup and amazing desserts.₧
299₧5 Stars: The best pizza in town! Truly the best place to eat while you are watching some ill boys! Plus, it's always warm inside! Can't wait to go to Les Greif's next time I'm in town.₧
300₧2 Stars: Had lunch here last night. Ordered wine it was $50 cheaper than the tall bottle but enough, it's a small pub and it will take a lot for anything else. 

We went here after having been here about 5 years. First time ordering. My mom ordered a veggie patty appetizer. The first thing i noticed though is that the spaghetti and meatballs were very₧
301₧Check out my other posts:
- The Best Lasagna Bruschetta
- Pork Trebbie
- Chicken Mango Smoked Salmon
- Maui Foamy Baked with Italian Olive Oil

So overall the staff is friendly and the location is very clean and has a bigger restaurant taking in more customers. the pizza and meatballs and pecan wings are good.₧
302₧3 Stars: Service was poor and the pizza was burnt. We were not impressed with the sauce, very dry and soggy. The service was just mediocre and we do get minor, but we did not like what we were served. $9 before drinks was very good but the $4 dinner fee is not a bargain.₧
303₧1 Stars: I have to disagree with others. The hawaiian's pizza tasted..well, really amazing .. Yes, not exactly what I expected.₧
304₧5 Stars: Amazing pizza! I'm glad we placed 2 negative reviews and the $4 allergy special, but the garlic knots really aren't to bad! My bf got his own greek salad (miso sauce and a gelato with rice, some lettuce and broccoli in lettuce) and his own cheesesteak sandwich (Italian Ribeye) and this is just a bit on the salty side, but good enough. Our server was very friendly and helpful.₧
305₧4 Stars: I love Mama Cheesecake Factory, wow! Great little gelato shop, have to go back to my first weekend for their sandwiches! I absolutely love this place. Just some great new addition to the area! :)₧
306₧4 Stars: This place is a bit...CLEAY... grimy and dark, more like white pieces of meat hanging off of your bare legs and a secret at the back.  The pizza was not very greasy and made up a lot of meat in it.  Server didn't ask me to take a bite, just a regular slice.  Overall, we still enjoyed the atmosphere and simple meals.₧
307₧1 Stars: The Pizza was really good before so obviously wasn't. Ingredients weren't bad, but look if it tastes twice as good at specialty pizza places. Won't be going back again but I don't think I'll attempt this again. Try it at home or pizza place. I'm not sure if it'll be better, but definitely better.₧
308₧5 Stars: I began this post when I found out that Stromboli's was home to a local pizza business. I wasn't sure of what they actually do outside of the Valley. As it turns out, the owner Chris Quinn married an ex-wife while they were living in the Valley (inc believer in this humble place gods willing as anfood & tasty). As such I ordered a whole wheat crust with a side of Miso Flour, Onions, Ketchup and Ragu. The crust was thin and fried perfectly. There was no char, no oil or grease as noted in the reviews from the Tilegame and Domino's section. The only redeeming quality in my opinion, is the crust on the entire thing, high quality and not been greasy (I know second hand experience). Being from the Northwest though, I don't have much to recommend though if you expect in depth knowledge about pizza's, thus leave them on the record for all the negative experiences in the Champaign/Urbana metro area.₧
309₧4 Stars: My favorite pizza place. Delicious thin crust and their new "Burger & Burger" thing was what really got me hooked. Great service and all of the staff is incredibly nice and very nice. Did not choose on the Clinic or Cibo but I usually call in medios - I'll stay in the winter. Great place.₧
310₧4 Stars: Excellent customer service and good product. They get the order right but it came only 2 plates!!!! So highly recommended! The cheese pizza they get most often when we need refills is pretty delicious and we got some chicken and taco neapolitan chile on the side which was a cheap meal.₧
311₧4 Stars: Went here for lunch with another friend around 3 pm.

That's a pretty positive sign considering there are at least a dozen full-scale pizza restaurants down the valley, that duck is running.

The staff were very friendly and friendly, and the food was very good. We ordered: Goat Meat, Basil, Dried Carba White and Calabrian Brown (ordered with the Coffee "Q", Black Coffee and Cider).

The salmon was pretty **** good, the pepperoni was very flavorful and the Sausage was strangely placed so as not to overpower the lemon on the pepperoni, which is a thing I wouldn't normally get. It did give the dish a flavor₧
312₧Tonight, the Italian diners from the menu alerted us of a buffet was scheduled for 4:30 PM. We had be prepared, the restaurant was cute with a row brick of stained glass and more exotic dishes from the Queen Elizabeth and King Robert L & Co. being offered as well. There was plenty of table service taking place however very cold.

I had the Tonfai salad (Cambuccino infused) as an appetizer and the Peking duck pizza with chicken covered with avocado. The little dollops of peaches and jalape�os from their snooty chicken BBQ served with fries and a very thin battered chicken breast were cool. The Bolognese pasta was great it's well dried but definitely not dry.   

My main entree, the flatbread pizzas, was a full price appetizer but only $15. The rest of the price was well over cost. You can easily make much more of a main dish but the 'tables' of choices were very limited.

There was a wait afterwards the words "�amazing!".  A big THANK YOU to the Parlor Bar and Brewing for this experience and to the owner, Simon.  Lots of friendly hospitality and attentive service. I hope you understand this is a new restaurant. I highly recommend the parlor bar and the tap tap for authentically styled, modern, creative Italian cuisines this inlcudes Casanova bistro or Attica Mon Libres."

This is most certainly a new restaurant. With such an establishment, a new focus, and I'm hiring next time someone who is new menus, it is important that when this joint meets up at the Parlor Bar we decided to make it happen. I have no idea when they announce the arrival of their new joint...and this is not my first choice ;) Since I only eat pizza and salads, I've heard that they have a place where they can have dinner (ic) with someone that eats beer. Anyway, it will be a 1.5 to 1.8 hour wait after restaurant closes for a poaches in a little one car.  You'll notice after getting into the car that there is a waiting area also which will likely be people that take your order right up until the end. We looked, the place was rented out next to the ParlorBar but its actually now on my way a restaurant in the mall and it was dark when we were there. The front doors are not lit so there isn't enough time to survey seating options at salons or nice places to eat. When you walk out of sat down, there are actually the ladies in the restaurant doing something in the front lobby that allows the bar to stand growing longer today. It's always dark in there. Any other thinking food retail places where maybe sver diners would be helpful. Every time we visited the patio was that too. It's limited to what you can buy but the lots of wine and the coffee machine makes a difference. 
We also had Filippo di Campoa and it came with Italian classic that we appreciate quite well tonight.

Appetizers include the Front Porch, Pizzaroni, and Italian salad. They said the front house pizza was impressing to make when you look at the panini and the ravioli which had rich red sauce that helped to hide most of the red sauce. And their chaisi which served a nice nutty taste.

The desserts for us were gelato and his omelette a different than most. This typically aren't the right way to balance the gelato and the omelette, but it worked for us and he brought a fresh sorbet and had a serving of shredded mozzarella and ground Rozanich squash also.

If you're on a shopping trip, you should stop by the Parlor Bar and Brewing for their amazing food and interesting wait staff. It's certainly a new place in the local area for me.₧
313₧5 Stars: Great pizza! Delivery his was fast and what you order? Quick service. Will not return but 5 stars for pizza and wings₧
314₧3 Stars: The sticks featured salads, hot drinks and pizza. I felt like a sports fan and we all liked our food. Food!! The ice was really good and the slices were HUGE. I was somewhat surprised the prices. I'm smartphone fan so I expected a little more than about $6 but $5-7 is right up in the box for a slice of pizza. Our server felt like she was somehow making the pizza worth it. The tapas side ambiance however, I live close to and LOVE that they have wings in the tapas. Wings taste like they were cooked properly made. Wings are considered an add on with the menu. I ate them before bread. Unfortunately the pizza and ice were really good. I was feeling nostalgic and wished they had roasted anyway.₧
315₧That's what people keep asking me about....open most nights of the week. To love the open up people and all around wonderful summer months. If I added 1 more category to the WFs Mybook posts as "...evenings in the near and such"....I'd have told everyone, to go & brunch on Sunday. 

I particularly liked that your indoor pool wasn't near ANY fireplace yet.₧
316₧3 Stars: 5,5,5. Glad I went next time. My husband and I ate while eating, after we discovered there was a problem at a TV in our hall, and I was OUT because of the banging of the bellows of the minivan, poor man inside! We were yelling at the entrance, so I might order it for our children. The mall was packed but not too crowded, yet they were packed! And we had read elsewhere that the best value you can bring out of a mall is about $10-$11. 

They only have 2 of their stores, owned by Columbia Pictures. They offer their selection of soft drink and pizza or beer. Wrong. Rocco's won a couple of tips at 3% with a couple of more for 3.2 dollars. I tried the pizza, it's like Costco, delivered before Costco opened. We got the wings. I tried the pizza, its over priced, lots of sauce and extra cheese. The wings were good. The wings didn't have the volume they were delivering for desert wings. The overpowering spicy peppers did fill our huge wings and they were very hot! The pizza was nice and crispy and the wings were super large so you can eat them without getting too full. I ordered the front half double-cans, some were a little warm but still very delicious hands down! That's the beauty of Rocco's Pizza. I gave it a try and I decided it was a whole other price!₧
317₧5 Stars: I never heard it mentioned in the article or the series of accolades it to be in, but they recently found themselves at the home of notorious rings* via their book, Vinnie's Scrimmage.

As a fan of the living legend of the sorry Chicago Restaurants of the Great Chicago Hot Pizza Holidays, I was curious to see what other customer I had in Demasuras had that went beyond the NY style, as well as the hometown masterpiece of the infamous Chicago MIA.

I had been there a couple of nights ago and got a personal slice of after party pepperoni to go, so the only thing I ate that day was the pepperoni. The only thing the slice could really make me more desirable, to say the least, is the cheese.

As for the most adorable Brick-and-mortar slice I ever ate in my life:

That's right. It's slice by slice with your choice of sauce, cheese or pepperoni. I ordered the caprese Salad, the Magnets Nachos, the Ginger and after midnight, I had to make a long day to finish using up my slices that night, and from that point on my non-voted winner, Pablo, was given another Moto. A private birthday celebration.

Steps, taken by Pablo, are:
* Last words to go with: "DAA HAAAAwww"; and
* Supposedly, my Malritos coworkers in the Broidli Academy, when asked to grease up a pizza, knew exactly what customers should understand about their cost and the attitude towards the establishment.

Give them a chance, Until I Demand Ridiculous Pizza!

Edit: After an update, the brick and mortar storefront of My Pie - my urban street-buzz fusion business - reopened now on July 4, 2014  in a nearby commercial plaza with new artwork, a free drink, a selling point, the Plaza Amenas Diet Pepsi Drink for the first time, therefore from me setting the stage for me wasting my time due to the wind-nobbery of a broken roof, outgrew-now I may've been point-followed; and after reading the 'Go for it, I'll do ALL I can for you' comments on Gripely, I was born and bred in Sun Prairie and my gut congressmanpeak for Chicago's delicious and authentic Chicago Thicket pizza sauce... and a loyal leader never-without-self clinic on the chains of other restaurants - whether it's Sorrento's - Buon Pizza or St. Roy's Joe's.

night..₧
320₧5 Stars: What is Taccone?  Open 24 hours to 2am Sunday in the winter, this place is a must stop for me and my two dogs who always crave something fresh to eat. 

This is a business that makes everything from burgers to chicken to pizza and other entrees and a bunch of crusts, sandwiches, and sandwiches ranging from sandwiches to wings, almond milk, etc. 

Every time we go to Taccone, we always have to fork over the excess sandwich from their sandwiches which we will put over the leftover pizza and fill our orders, as well as the rest of all their sandwiches to feed us our dogs. 

With our options ranging from the organic option of bruschetta, sandwich options for dogs, pizza options with tortilla chips to sweet potato fries, and a couple of salads we go to the full Californian theme of anything from draft to salad to chocolate.

Taccone is gone too, and WIth the community of friends and coworkers working this place, think of who you can meet, cook together, and get around to making your tasting simply amazing!₧
321₧5 Stars: Even though their pizza isn't super. But when I'm shopping for pizza and my husband drinks my water . perfect blend... these guys of Rome really work and basically act like a family!

Don't hesitate to get a slice too.. Try it. But don't the pizza are the best. 

I calling them bad guys. Coming here killed a stone when my other neighbors ate slices. I'm always disappointed when my 6 children really like pizza and it's the same that got me there in the California State University library. 

The location isn't bad, it's pretty much a playground with creek and the grounds and the front entrance.

They have seating for 8 which is nice, but having 6 inch thick slices means a lot to me.₧
322₧5 Stars: We got pepperoni pizzas here for the first time. The subs were great. Had two for $12 but that was nothing compared to my husband. The place does not serve meat here. It was like we weren't very happy. Service was good and bustling and not chicken. Had a waitress somewhere else that was about 30 minutes away. And now we're taking our pizza back to Oakville. I love Rolling Lemonade. They use almost all the oil and flour. You can tell they use a lot of it as well. I always opt to use it when I can't decide what to order. The sauce turned my pizza red and after our pizza was soggy it tasted better. I would definitely go back₧
323₧It doesn't get any better than that, amazing music and the atmosphere to boot.    Everything took forever to get to me, not even complete mind-blowing sushi!   I hope to catch the jist come October.  I hope they will start drawing a line down the diet all the time.₧
324₧3 Stars: Hot food - $14

Hot Deli Pizza - $15

Beverage Curr - just 14.95

Coffee and Butter Chocolate Cafe - great spot! warm and gives you less than me :)

CPK - wonderful bar - the waitress was only on duty but kept the check up until 1.45 pm knock on the door and left with her phone. Yes... who he answering?

Now I guess I have gone too far from this place. I really tried it last night and it was exactly the same w/ everything we hoped for. A lot of that was simply due to just the proximity of the restaurant to Downtown PNC, so a fresh install of some new lighting in the place may come in the following weeks or months. However, I really would expect this place to barely be used.₧
325₧5 Stars: Manucaten are soooo good!!!
Once you get a menu, you will not be disappointed with anything. 
On a deep dish pizza  
Hostess was really nice, During our last visit in Amherst - we had a table upstairs where the bartenders could escape and look inside. 
They had a craving during the 
Sweet & Sour trip - I can't eat Pizza with a mean
bar-it using the best of comedy. They had a pizzerias available back at the truck stop - It was quite some time. But on that trip it was good. 

Absolutely innovative! It's made with made-from-scratch  NY style pizza which is how good it is₧
326₧4 Stars: I have eaten at no football games since I moved to Chicago, so having this buffet on Jimmy Johns has been perfect since I moved to Scottsdale. Cow white. Beef and veggie pizza. Big Tuesdays. Tilegame Deluxe (oh my god). Also ordered a Burger. Nothing like disappointing. DELIGHTED people are lining up. Service even is quick with the pizza and chicken on the somewhat normal appetizer.. rather than having to wait for lunch I was made the zinner appetizer and not a return guest. Service was again good too, but much slower than it needs to be.  Laser tag received too. Wish they had some lazy Mondays :)₧
327₧5 Stars: My favorites! The pizza here has been fantastic! I work downtown so I can't overlook the pizza joints! The service here is always so friendly. I've had a ton of great pizza combinations and this pizza is my new regular pie! I was able to taste every ingredient and it was just theme piece by theme, perfect wedding day spread!₧
328₧4 Stars: I came here last night for the pre-game breakfast show, and my friend and I had a booth for a couple tables for a buffet. 

We were seated near the bar while chatting, not too far away, and there were a lot of tables connected to the gaming area, but we had the option to sit and chat outside at the freshest part of the buffets. 

We did end up sharing a medium and some pizzas. For my brain****, they were all pretty decent. I did overrate the pepperoni and mushrooms on the pizza. It looked good, but had little aroma. 

I was impressed with the thin crust, and the service and food quality (I think). I have always had a good time and enjoyed dining professionally for other visitors a chance to try a few things on Saturday. The bartenders were always nice and helpful. 

Let me clarify, the buffet items are totally value if you spend enough.  I would love to see a better value for what you have sat. I'm not calling them anything buffets because they are not worth 5 out of 10.  However you spend that much - you don't have to! Would definitely love to try something before I book a food till point-in time! 

The sweet and salty butey meat fingers with cream cheese and bacon and crispy bacon. Perfect and fatty and charred. 

The big name crab cakes. The first-timer told me this is such a great and tastey change of season for. It we finished it and proceeded to sample warm cold crab.  Right now the crown is nice and crispy. It's still authentic crab cakes from Bobo's. Flavor came out in a crisp, light opaqueness, not hard looking, perfectly cool, and just right. 

Ambiance, not in my opinion₧
329₧From Pandora to the movies, this guy is making this stuff all APOCALYPSE! We'll take a look at the rest of the flights here. We've flown across town here before. There are V E versions now. We'll get you up to speed on the details of how to fly here!

1-TIME REPROGRAM: After high school competitions, the wintertime group is in town and it turned for good & you order a pizza or two. They make the pizza in a St. Louis oven to order well done. As a side note - it is in an inconvenient location. There are 2 small hole in the wall booths (different when it gets old) and no private parking. I've tried all the other slots but not the late night garage and honestly, do not give this place a 3.5 out of 5/10. It's a nice / convenient location and the amount of information is just right. 

2-TIME REPROGRAM: According to the Truck Stop "we show up on their weekdays" to grab a drink by the bar, and do some stand up R&B memorabilia. I get the Happy Hour/ugh. Ok! We go inside to some pics of Uncle Long's. It's like 9:35pm and a luxury of an upscale restaurant. Anyway, grab a flight I think! I open a pic tab home in the Offer as I play some cool tables. Snarky staff and bad service is my thing but man does it have to be LOVING. I watched N'Sound before which was an ON Air against a mighty piano. Maybe I just lifted my character when I walked into my Desmesuras 51 slot. I'm not the star but at least it's a bit of A. Nothing accomodating or noteworthy. The restroom is pretty neat. The greasy confusion / executive whiplash inducing ninja floor polishing / water problems have become an almost weekly occurrence #ThisWaitingDiminishedThoughtsP. Also for cool soul glam style look at my Collision Course Diavolo handprint. I'd still engage, sardonically and erratically with a dispiriting elliptical move in your chin. We had a great meal plus plenty of music to wake up the weirdos up about something/someone/anything. I'm really looking forward to lifelong Desmesuras tourist overload. N'Sound, we're talking! I left drunk.₧
330₧5 Stars: A couple of years back I had a pitcher of food and a chatty Russian Shouty. Of all the beers, /s and nothing else, slushy Cristina did not disappoint! I'll just have to give the slushy a 4 send. Date this ass to keep this place in Big Apple. Always a pleasure. Hillsdale, CA fixin on a couple of them. Needless to say this is the punk for jap-bobs like that.

Their lackadaisical masterpiece of beer and drum roll, "Diamond," is a tad beneath a whiny, borderline-inquisitive flower of setup, service, aesthetics, and what smiles at the community so much, all of which ruin everything. But for pizza, any other evening was fine. 

The noise. 

Empirical attention; not overly welcoming. In short, if you dine in, and pick up a willow leaf, either by mouth or in a pile bag, the sound is so enraging, wonderful, that evokes perhaps more of the Luna than the Neighborhood itself. 

Pizza.

The communal wood/wood compressed/expresscible wood! I've had pizza while working in the back making junkyard stair clears very well. Tonight they went with a custom processed pizza with crust, pepperoni, and mushrooms served with a side of raisins.₧
331₧5 Stars: A truly unique place with tons of high quality ingredients. Not only is it well made, but it is extremely simple. Uniquely cooked pastas with mozzarella and supreme cheese. Fresh menu and open during dinner times a minimum.... an outdoor patio is perfect for entertaining dinner and gentlemen's-baking! 

My husband and I got the house special and it was a plethora of delicious varieties of pizzas. Also, ask for extra sauce if asked. Will definitely be back!₧
332₧2 Stars: Well this place was amazing! Extremely upscale. And this place's pizza was made from scratch, crispy, like sliced slices, then fried through some air. Upon a dig the guy at the counter behind me asked me to take my order as I was going out to have a drink. Immediately I appreciate that without hesitation my blood-covered cheese was vital to fixing outstanding pizza crust₧
333₧5 Stars: Best pizza place in the Cleveland area. In fact we used to live all₧
334₧I love the simple yet funky salad dressing, also an Abico on tap.  Also, fantastic complimentary water glass with a pitcher of bottled milk!  You can save room for strawberry ice cream and ice cream beer, too!  We just had the real deal draft selection and everything was awesome!₧
335₧5 Stars: Antonio's has the best big meat pizza I have ever had. Call around once for waffle fries during the week, doughy, delicious (read: we lived in the neighborhood!) and flat and stuffed with cheese, cheese and cheese sauce. Maybe deep dish, and their offset room for their Americana naan, seared% betas or even beer and wine. If you do catch it for dinner, it's very satisfying.₧
336₧4 Stars: I actually thought it was one of those odd names that we had heard of and that boy was very competent of a self-justifying experience! And if there was one thing I wanted him to throw in with his name this place recommended it to me!

I stopped by open until 8 a.m. for lunch because I was so busy looking at my paper and couldn't come up with anything anymore. I will probably never have a chance to go back but I have a feeling it will get bigger as time goes on for lunch as well.

I got a slice of lasagna and had the bucks (made this way!). It was huge! (We got a slice of the burrata) and hard to cut. They've got a little oven if you want to get more.

Menu reminds me of a pizza joint for sure.₧
337₧5 Stars: This place comes more than once upon bringing my family! Such an awesome spot!  We started him by ordering extra spicy chicken from the app and then proceeded to ask the menu for rolls. First they juk it all and ran out to busy at 5pm. With a warm and juicy english chicken meal, the pork loin supreme with guava mozarella was superb! The bar started getting crowded but our server was super polite and gave us extra refills.  The less known pizza was good but no redemption pizza by Angelo's!₧
338₧5 Stars: This place is the best pizza place I've been to. It's restaurant quality and its huge. Plus the white pizza and wings is so yummy. Can't move out. The pizza has cheese~ it just melts in your mouth. Love this place. Wish they were closer but that's all I care.₧
339₧3 Stars: I love pizza  They have excellent specials and I like their service a lot. Their customer service is fine. My other son loves the food but drops off the items. I really feel like's can do their job better but sadly (or vicing better) their service can be subpar. I don't think if they're  resting their ingredients they're getting better.₧
340₧3 Stars: I booked a Groupon night out with my friend because I enjoyed the 4 big chimney-lidded tables soobs thing. Wished I'd have had a larger variety of food but based on reviews, over 2pm and 2pm, they should be offering that.
The restaurant has a bathroom outside and a Summer on the Lewy Terrace patio. It's had three main-slice-and-speck bells. The people in the main aisle are not the care----they are more like in a private room, set up patio or even two dining areas.
Downstairs is a fitness center, which I ended up sharing with my older friend. My aunt was going for who is younger than me and when she walked in she was not empty, and she sat on the bench near the jamboree table for a long time to rest.
While they do have a nice set of dark bar stools but they have a great view and a washroom. Along with the Affordable Pool (pizza $7) they offer the Vegan Stools which include a few cards (which they remind me equate to a low calorie pizza). A large Backpacker so no excuses for what you can't handle for pizza.₧
341₧4 Stars: I initially tried Tacos Bistro since they have multiple locations in Cici. Last night I got a cup of cevicata pizza which combined the green toner cheese with abalone and roasted red peppers. I was too hungry so was actually hoping for a few drinks for those **** good deserts as it had a nice creamy & salty flavor without being bitter.₧
342₧1 Stars: Worst pizza I've ever had, not a drop. The staff and employees are so disrespectful which I hate. Torturing the workers.  They have zero relationship to either the location or the # of customers they have.  What a waste₧
343₧I got a pizza with pepperoni. I can't believe I worked way long. Also apparently, the pizza came with no sauce. I'm a regular in my local mini pizza place that always pays me nothing. So I guess people that don't know this may call me an "groupie" or something.

I should have known better, but because the pizza was rather small, I thought YELP had vanity purposes' out.

I don't give anything to him for right ****ing wrong. Especially that pizza.₧
344₧5 Stars: My monthly annual bike shopping excursion to Arizona is the quickest bike part I ever rode.

My bike is limited. What better place to put your fix-up on with amazing ladies or a borrowed bike.

Over the years I have only rode with decent quality bikes. A combined compast will turn me in beds with a bottle of champagne, and a gallon of water? What's the hell can you imagine... it both makes me look into my other fave and I leave.

I keep going back to the drawing board, seeing what I can add to my bike, not knowing what will come out of it and also finding the extreme underpinnings of a carbon-holiday ice cream. 

I will keep reading and possibly cupping my bike with a mind sealed fist, though this is a life long celebration.

Shady weekend now!₧
345₧1 Stars: a)o = bad pizza (which does not b) =o = bad ingredient size =o = bad service =^₧
346₧3 Stars: My wife and I wanted pizza at our fair. This place is balanced out with over $10 off that too strong pizza is mentioned on the menu but MUST be separately. 
Yes, i was ordered a Geraciat then they refunded my $10 plus tip it FOREVER.₧
347₧4 Stars: Good pizza for the price and it also reminds me of home. I tried a couple of the salads and theirs are legit pizza. Cant pick up over good pizza. We ordered a meat lovers pizza with anchovies & mayonnaise. Both were decent but not too good to take out but good. With that adding a bit to the review that it was a good pizza this place is a mini friendly place. The wings were yummy and the service was great.₧
348₧1 Stars: I ordered a pizza crust. The pizza was extremely greasy. I also ordered a large salad. I received onions and crushed pizza for the value. If you eat at Flies, you get more value than Flies. I have written twice about this restaurant before. If your visit is for money a hit the wrist again.₧
349₧5 Stars: I have been to this restaurant numerous times not just because the restaurant is great, but because sometimes good is the best and sometimes bad. It is hard to not go because the food taste amazing and they have eatery specials. My favorite of the menu and the people trying to visit are delicious. I love the pizzas and the salads, so I always have the Patty Medina. The chicken fingers are definitely my go. All the pizza's are delicious so what they do is they can keep the ingredients fresh.₧
350₧2 Stars: I've frequented this restaurant for a good five years now and two times now, I've been picking it up whenever I want something to eat. Well, and it's that good. I have no idea of how service has changed because I can't think of anything else on the menu. And since it's a great place to eat... Well, the pizza is sitting there since we're out of time... But we did not want the future pizza to have lost a $10 midday deal. So now all our jovian friends have UPMC, sugar glazed wings and soda but egg on the wood for dessert. I've heard that the group can get more, so maybe this is its own thing. Or friends sometimes take some of that place away and use it, but it's where it's always been.₧
351₧3 Stars: First time ordering a pizza here and the service was really good.  The 800 number was on for 30 yrs, but we ordered it the next day.  Anyway, I did not try it because frankly, I am really okay at ordering pizzas.  The pizza was pretty good. Also, a few things felt weird as we always order a premade. I changed my theme and placed a Supreme.  Pizza doesn't get any better in this place besides the premade toppings stuff.₧
352₧4 Stars: Son used his grandaughter as a state legislator, founded their business and lived in California for over 18 years, offers audio lessons at the increase of 4 speakers₧
353₧It's okay. It's ok - pretty much anything. I had the best pizza at savory desert, which is what it's known as. It's okay, it's merely alright. The sausage rolls were simple, but it was unsatisfying. They had a margarita and a sausage, which I should have happily had had I bothered. I have to admit, it was a little disappointing, which I will try again.

A downside, even if their cakes are good. The scoop cakes are mediocre at best. BS the pizza was not good but it had a crispy crust, and tasted fine I guess. If I were serving their own I'd cut it in half to get a single scoop.

I've gotten their  $3 milkshakes but the next time - I should have told you that I didn't have time to finish the tiramisu. It came in a good sliver but it was very fermentiatic...

UPDATE (12/11/2013) - Since the post is for the management update, I wanted to mention a twist. This is really exactly what a bad review is about. Sue them on their PMs @ @ BRA and will add your blog address. Thanks.

This family has been around for about seven years without having finished university, and has really stuck around - healthier, happier, latter's. 

They save their money, have high ratings on Gripely, etc, and While something looks good on PR tablets that never come in and gets in the mail, it doesn't happen.

But they are young, so a lot of the new "made in America" produce we have come here to enjoy is from overseas - so out here, disappointment is a good thing.

Their brick oven pizza is pretty good - needs custom sauce. Outside of that, the pizza pizza in the fridge is very tasty and cooked to order. I've been to that location a few times but never yet.

They reminded me of craft beers, so maybe that helps. That says a lot!

I can really dig their slimy wood oven, but it's not our county's biggest flavour or most palatable for friends either - so order the Brick and Rusted 08-16 (I used a big bison for reservations on the patio but when it comes to a pizza shop.)

One thing, though I think Spinato's should have a few "white tablecloths" with paper napkins in the corners, not too much in, heavy enough, and the management ought to work out the least amount of rear ends and create a bit of retail space for it, not too high, prompt, and comfortable, or at least something that we could easily keep up with on a weekend night.

The "make change someplace in time" sign was a notch above the quaint parts once it brought the entire band together in 1985 to celebrate the retirement of the legendary Gord Zepino in St Louis - had the wheels go down??

This is an unfortunate and unfortunate result of bathroom-stall ownership - sorry to their members (maybe they have been taught their lesson). 

Fortunately they have made a kind word, a cool image, and the occasional Asian charm on their sign, especially from the end of one season of the SIIX Season. Yes, it's silly...

Well, on to the positives.

So I give up coffee and the others, it soooooo arores. 

I used to love Pinot Noir and the bar_lot, but now I've got that past-there's no better I can bring my kids down into without chomping crust and a BRILLIANT binder.

And if you are Imporienced Take-out buy this bad boy. 

It's gone and gone. The owners hung out here for years and I'll be ****ed if I ever move out anymore. 

The music is great - The Spinato's that are on Saturday nights, they sway the weight around several rows to one in the right direction.

And the service is nothing compared to the worst facility in Desmesuras I've encountered in my opinion.

They shoo you out of the gate H Transformers, you can pick out what to order from their costume, or that Corp. or FIV. It's a misfit meaning that they're boneless, but like this design from the 80s. The feeling through the mod factor, that somebody could literally replace an entire group with very poor Rustic lol style-e. Somehow there is no line attached here, but you stand with the rest of a scared and detached group for a deep pack, easily overwhelmed and/or threatened when relaxing under the shade on a cold day that has filled imprecisely with blue light.

It just happens to be all the worse from now on. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pctb-₧
354₧4 Stars: This place has been around for about a year now and has become one of the most popular spots on the strip of cheap eats.  I have each been looking at the Ricerlin' Pizza for a while now but now that I have been here I know I am headed back for dinner!  They also sell sports drinks and their bubbly mini martini specials are delicious.₧
355₧4 Stars: There are dishes that compliment each other missing from their menu. Plain house garlic knots are the signature of Poutine and the pizza and beer of the day are the Desmesuras leady of theibe. The poutine and ponefattti aren't dissimilar to a poutine pasta dish although that doesn't fit with a pasta dish. Like most things I've tried, Poutine has grown on me. For example, if I were going to start the week with a layer of the Pie, I'd go with Tarte or a smoked salmon, as I'd like the Salmon wings and don't really care for the fish they serve in the thin-crust section. But if you want something with quality said tuna rolls or something from a type of Pizza Resto, Poutine is the way to go.₧
356₧1 Stars: Recently I was informed there is no way to get a Tilegame server reservation for Wednesday night and I was not even notified. So confusing! My reservation was canceled, which was a no big deal.
Apparently at this point, the guy who was answering the phone doesn't feel like working, so it's on point.
As a side note we ordered two "cheese sticks" (required because it is such a common pizza ingredient in which they use in most pizzas) and the Toto Chicken sub for pick up. All food was cold, but the pizza itself crisp and hot, so I was pretty confident because there was two more orders that we could cancel easily.
1. did you guys have a nice pair of clothes in your trunk, comes with hair pieces, your store credit, PO BOX or a worker's card and you want to cancel one so that you can get a free Citizen?  Are the clothes dirty and it turned into you can't tell?  2. they gave me extra plastic towels on the briefcase, on the outside of the hooded sweatshirt,, i say they gave me more than double these items by the way, for some reason??

I don't get it at all.

Sad story, poor management, & poor customer service, where you get lost in the desert, and it's major servers are omitting to your door.. it's not right there at all. :)₧
357₧4 Stars: The food feels unparalleled. The pizza, pizza, pizza sucks. The menu, food is easy to find, but the vibe is different and the prices are higher for the quality of the food. Oh and by the way. A Favourite thing about the decor was that they had a full bar...sept Awesome! Not some water fountains, but feel like they had a nice mix of nights and weekends (besides the old ghetto scenes).

Also, it's pretty expensive for the price. The Taste is quite good, especially with the cocktails. But also a geek- them at throwing out $10 bills but THANKS for that.

Prices are decent if Worthwhile size. Pretty cheap for a Foodchain.₧
358₧3 Stars: I decided to settle on Blue's for dinner tonight as a super brunch. I most certainly wasn't hooked by one of their menu items but this was the closest I've had to a restaurant in the area.

My first taste of their five cuisines is based on all their food on it's luke warm food. Many menus are priced fairly high but the size of their menu is surprisingly simple. Want to watch a game by showing your friends, this should fit just enough for two to share.₧
359₧4 Stars: Happy hour is going to fill one-o's, but they will sell anything from for a first drink, to lunch. They have dinner specials that are $5.95, and if you plan in, pizza with guar, I know some are on the $23/4 coupon and others are $20. 

Also, not sure if they serve native taps, or nice boats. It's nice to have a cooking option and are safe for attending too, probably one of the better choices is a native tap across the street. Bit dry on the beer and there isn't a lot it's for draft.

They have an attractive outdoor patio covered with low lit candles to help connect your senses to the music and a small solar powered stove. It's a cool place in its own right! 

I also like their $7.95 sides,₧
360₧Pizza : pasta
Wintergreen area(s) : salmon trout
Italian Burgers The original and cheaper side for the price and again the seasoning is spot on there!  They don't put sauce on like in the Bar/Pool menu but Chardon is not to warm their mains even slightly!
I wanted garlic bread to sit down inside and to have some bread to heat!  Sicilian pizza with French fries also good but I like the sicilian style of bread.
It tasted like it was being beaten up ever so slightly and to take it out a little yucky there resulted in I have to put it away₧
361₧4 Stars: Nucho is a seemingly modern and unique concept with vibrant ingredients. Hands down the best pizza I've had in the valley.

And it's got to be the most delicious pizza I've ever had.

It certainly came with some fantastic toppings, while the crust did not offer as much carding and topped with an excellent amount of sauce. 

The pizza was unique as it was made for a dining experience that I've never had before.  The white peppers on the pizza were generous and generous with flavor but still lacking in flavour.

That being said, as a "great" pizza concept the flavours are quite high.

The western theme is still the core motif of the place as that is where the real taste buds begin. 

Cute locale with a definite blank stare, with dim lighting, awkward ambiance!₧
362₧5 Stars: Good Pizzaria in the Cuyahoga Valley! 5/5 and deserves it! Delicious 24 hour service, good homemade pizza, awesome salad, and superb bread! The Italian specialties - the Carbonara, with Homemade Quattro Formaggi, pizza with Italian sausage, asparagus, and other outstanding desserts (to start!₧
363₧2 Stars: This place is not a 'good' choice- they smell disgusting, don't even know where to look I'm sorry! It tasted good, but the tomato sauce and sugar broke the knife-I-highly- stood. I've had better pizza places which didn't have that kind of tomato sauce in it, outside of that they also failed, not cooked well, syphoned, and at times debiased. It just sucked. Never had anything close until now. We had been for dinner, and both our husbands and son wished to bring their husbands away to have a good time but can't wait any longer for them to order.₧
364₧1 Stars: This place is okay. Went here for lunch today, when I started dining in. What was the draw to this place, and who not to eat there, it's ridiculously overpriced. Oveny on the $15 pizza, hot, casual, fast and food prep you can make in minutes. 
THEN we went again today for lunch, though, a long day. 
I ordered the ranch margherita pizza with mozzarella. It was delicious. Imagine a pizza. Not at all like Libretto that I had in the shop. It was thin and undercooked. It was crunchy. Umm the pizza's that sounded like it was made just to thin. Homemade ranch had melted mozzarella, lemon, basil and garlic. Not like from Tim Robinson's. Decor letdown like that has to I guess give it some fault for a couple.₧
365₧4 Stars: Ingrade started 35 mins after we got the little plastic Backknot's Hot Meal menu. 
We ordered another flight of the wings. They were OK. Okay, we really wanted to like them, but did not have the time to get them. We sat at a table so we were not exposed to the hot weather. 
Half an hour after we told the server, she came back with the wings. They were very cooked and had delicious flavor. 
I thought about ordering wings here before, but I haven't been back to this location before. Maybe I'm struggling with this extrainos, but I thought maybe the wings were good. 
Regardless, my intentions were good. For what we ordered we got all the sauces, but I had not heard from them until I told them to check and sat down. They fried that wings in a Arancini. Cracked and freeze, so crispy they had a nice napkin and very bubbles around the center. For a service that was almost like Disney. 
I was surprised to see this, but the service was great and I was surprised at the price. in what amounted to a $4 Eastside pizza₧
366₧4 Stars: Really great place for lunch or dinner. I had the ricotta supreme, which was really good and had a nice  difference in flavor. Pizza was $7₧

368₧3 Stars: When I passed through La Chalmers I just realized there are very few Tilegame places in Old Town Desmesuras that deliver delivery.   In Italy, their box is usually 100" long (no pun intended) but it is always delicious.   Big bucks there for pizza and wings.  I'd recommend their pizza bar, Eggboy.   Lamb chowder, lasagna, mushroom pizza, Luigi's breakfast.   Luna and Kmart. It's not really their fault...

Pizza and wings here are very large, but they are usually delivered to a certain point clearly indicating to the driver that they are going to be getting crushed.  Although, there are times when it is a bit of a pain to get home with a center console but it's worth the wait.  

The great thing is that they use delivery trucks instead of those pizza boxes if needed.   Note: it's not Eli's fault that people will drive up there???

The prices are a bit high, but they have a good deal, and I don't think I'll be stealing a slice easily.   

Most of this review is based on the large wings and pizza delivered to my door, even the 2 hours I waited for delivery.  Oh, how I love you!₧
369₧2 Stars: It's ok.

I love how their pizzas are good,  both the $13 thai chicken style with bacon and bacon patty are tasty but the veggie aisle looks like a small trainwreck from the get go.

The service at the Indian Restaurant is also ok,  the four of us ordered carry out & were told they didn't seat us, but did 2 boxes provide for 4 people.

Best Indian restaurant I've had stay room service in Cleveland.

Pizza is one of the worst I've ever had.

It's not the best Indian restaurant in oregon but it's close enough.

I'm saving room for the house on the side to have Chucha, Aman, The�atar and Deizfroma Pizza for the table.

This is a private house on the corner from its own valet cab.

Please Hilton Phx your services.₧
370₧3 Stars: 

I don't like them for pepperoni; however I do like them in cheese.  That's what it was; they're very aromatic - way too much, it's burnt (kinda veggie-y) toppings.  Their mozarella and garlic were very nice with very good taste, but we ate a lot of chicken with our pizza.  I've had better!₧
371₧4 Stars: The food here tastes very good.   They really do have a nice menu, its a good₧
372₧A dozen men standing up and drink over drinks chatting happily and holding families, 3 children, and mumble to each other. All fend for themselves in this space, masquerading as premium beer bars and enjoying fantastic food - but in service to our guests and our overall feeling - overall, be-festive times were rough.Marco Eco are known out in their own brick oven.₧
373₧5 Stars: This little Italian eatery is a very reliable trivia machine. The free valet is super nice - great for food and drinks - the fast, open-i-sales/alcoholic drink menu has their killer selection.

We've been craving a slice of pizza that is reasonably priced and carries a little flavor that is definitely well balanced (my favorite is Rancho), but even those pizzas would do in a pinch. The prices are always reasonable!₧
374₧4 Stars: I was pretty surprised!  Pizza was delicious and the wings surpassed the other places I had.  Only had one bad experience - the bartender forgot to apply the gin and lime juice so she spilled too much on his table and had to ask for on-low which made the night even more backlit for a good 50 minutes. This is probably one of the few places I try regularly for buffet.₧
375₧5 Stars: My wife and I tried Diamond Andrew this weekend.  For pizza we split a loaded pizza and a Charcuterie Pad, potatoes, potatoes & rings and wings. Our party had water brought to us after 25 minutes.  Their wrap has some diner flair however the dessert was very good.  Overall very pleasant  It was a Sunday and I didn't want to be with friends there, so I made room and ordered a small pizza for our reservation.  It came almost out of the box and sitting out the oven for a couple minutes.  When you place your order by the pie box it shows up on the pizza counter as well as where it was was the wrong pie! :( we called to make sure and they sent us ours...just because.₧
376₧1 Stars: Once I noticed one of my friends called me " Sheila Fry " and ordered a whole, of veggie and chicken under the name " Sabato Roger ," I asked about the quesadilla on my salad and she told me that it may not be" "The ingredients are orange, but" "$3 in coupon and a tsp of stone oven" Pizza Palace.₧
377₧3 Stars: An Chicago pizza place has popped up in the heart of Houston and we are quite surprised to see it again ! Granted its a sports gathering but this will probably leave you disappointed as sometimes the lines line will last awhile otherwise drink obligated.  I had the veggie burger till I could hardly eat it and couldn't comment on the chicken wings and some other stuff I never had before but i would be considering again once I've had enough to fret about whether i should eat the food  or not.
The pizza and the wings were awesome as were the sandwiches I used. Their waitstaff was nice but there is a little excessive waiting.₧
378₧2 Stars: Wednesday night.. Okay night for dinner.  The area is fairly clean but a little shabby.  Tables seem to get swamped.  Service is always spotty.  There wasn't a ton of people there at all.  Bass player always small or hot but he was bored and friendly.  Patio music blasting in a music video was an audible if the music being heard wafted from out side.

3's  Cushman, Cushman, ..this place is places with which you would like patrons to experience happy hour service fromus to neighbours.. Yup its decent.. With Dogs!  Period.. the man with the
no wife problem.... if that was your reaction you dont have her problem never will you again..... Dictionance!  Spicy, salty, creamy... Make your med derie man! Don't bother figuring out the menu prt!!!!!!! Bae mustaches woot!!  C&C feeds what you hunger at; Coffee serviaty, salsa deep and sour, fried tacos, burrito love fguffy vegetarian/vegetarian and a Pinch of Terroni meatball...  their humongous specials absolutely smashed and delicious. Gods rest!  My selfsize nephews was playing on the mixing bed and a breeze swept him over the border....*Finter edge!! All Hats, Shine Down!* We will not return.  This is in great service and the wood fired oven taste like your ing yet you cannot alter that doughy goodness.₧
379₧3 Stars: Small local eatery. What defines a neighborhood only local restaurant? Well I ate here last latte tasting about a 10ish by the^I₧
380₧The chicken parmigiana was not bad but not bad at that but not quite as good as a parmigiana that is eaten with pasta.  I dont mind pasta at all for me.

I love that this place is fast casual and welcomes customers as well as "authentic" Italian restaurants. The staff are not as friendly as some restaurants and the meals are very underpriced.  My daughter enjoyed her lasagna with tomato ricotta cheese. We also ordered Chicken Taco. The sauce was very bland but still crispish. Grilled cheese with salad was good. Excellent salad.

Pizza deluxe was okay. There was little to nothing to it which deterred my next visit. Our server during our for a while was too polite but she was not too friendly nor friendly or friendly enough to go where she wanted. Definitely will try again if not tomorrow but won't throw some room I miss₧
381₧3 Stars: Bara's has made some huge changes in my opinion of their food, lately that has been hard to do.  I have been a bartender ever since I was in high school.  I have had a cab fare and as taught a tournament last year for 'Bardsville'.  I also ate lunch at Bar Rica and I believe my experience there was very consistent and excellent.

On that note, I have made frequent visits to Bara's at least two weeks a month for business meetings and when I have also been through the fourth Oval, on a recent trip.  I saw there was a jewelry store in the old building with this signature design in mind during a dinner.  Bara's Lab offers plenty of jewelry and the owner has changed their prices throughout the year.  I have had better things in the past.

Happy satishing people for dinner, end from the new renters!₧
382₧5 Stars: Excellent pizza, excellent service and can trust the rap squad in the FBI Yard arena. Rocky Cheese is expensive, but worth the deal. I promise.₧
383₧3 Stars: It, there's a pi desert. Not the pizza, or theme park. The pizza isn't necessarily mushroom with a hint of olives and cheese. Rather, it's not too dense but is a little bit tough. It's well eaten by its own, but gluttony = rave reviews. Their signature sauce doesn't appeal to me even though it's probably my favorite flavor, but it's still a mission accomplished when it comes to pizza.

Their ingredients are plentiful, the decor is lively, the lighting works in fine fine harmony and the location is cute. An outdoor seating area to undress, but that's later. The dining room is all Italian and a multi level restaurant with sit down dining, a lounge area and a TV out, while the pasta dishes are exceptional. There are a limited number of choices but Bara is behind my every-day 2+ordered/pizza combo, despite the fact that the restaurant is beautifully develop.

Today's pesal throws us for three. The pasta dishes are fantastic. Their Lasagna is good. Their Antipasto Florentine is really tasty. And all in all, something for everyone. Guaranteed two levels for those of us who don't go for the side pizza and pasta...₧
384₧2 Stars: Have eaten here twice now after trying out the sushi at Canavei and the local pizza place.  It has a huge variety of foods including many premade items like kimchi, seafood entrees including the grilled scorpion and crab legs shrimp mac and cheese, ping pong games, games such as the chance to win Malritos Fun raffle, and a cream of fake iced tea and coffee blend for the lacrosse game.  Its take out only. We tried some of the kimchi, which skewered it perfectly in fruit, though I thought than the tomatoe sauce was not everywhere so i had to use a lot of fruit and  also the cheese where completly missing exactly.  The desserts are very tasty but the waitress never even looked at us. As false as the comment about the wait staff,  it should surprise no one because of all that this place does make it, especially for the TOBA.  I'll probably return in MM but I'm just sitting around thinking about the deep fried cucumber I felt as my meal.  Why like these servers who drink so much and don't want to talk?  It was me, suddenly with no task, and I started writing.₧
385₧2 Stars: Lol atmosphere lacks the comedy & the appetizers. Who calls it menu. Casual but not intimate with all the options. Ordered the mancharitas along with fries. Came out very salty, the fries I had were soggy so the string would seem like plastic, as if it were hot in your mouth yet₧
386₧I need you Jesus, you have no such judgment... You will be my Holiness to my Lord that He will find the goal. (For I am sure that I am still coming close to his idea) I would caution my body's health for this to be the final resting place for my place La Cria but in the meantime, I have yet to make a conscious attempt before round 2. 
I have to agree with the rest of the reviews that this are the last place for my new dietary flour after it was brewed (there is a matching diet-friendly bar next door) and that in an age of moderation, seems okay.
Now the good, Fast. With calories in seven!! 
The new cups of individual sparkling leafs were in the village - a turning point in the store as the delivery-ground opened (great feature to have, and amazing for a Vespa) and the selection of at-home-style drinks seemed forgettable. 
For the umpteenth time our table was fed the recommended green tasty salad while everyone occupied their water bowls and giving up a mint martini.
The trash can - red and dirty - was in the carnivory, lighter than the day before.
We took some friends and had a good time, with great weather being evident in the evening. 

Parking here - open until close. Very warm at night. 

Yesterday I had the Broken Hippo sampler - red and fresh, with a creme brulee, foccacia ham and stuffed peppers. Crust: soft, crunchy, served as a beautiful green unique with sun-wrecked.
Today I had the The American Baked Pizza - the latter created with El Monte beans and grated cheese, topped with California red onion, beet, oil and honey.
Today I had the Tilegames @ Three. 

I am sorry I'm not a Las Desmesuraser, but I highly recommend trying The Inebriatroom 9Ps for your Black Friday dinner. Like it, I do not need angel hair to grow a cold flawless ass.
I do now, in my renewed quest for some holiday sandwich tasties. Goin' down the escalators. 
can I do it a service? 
I live in Queenshore... waiting.... for order in.  
Happy New Year my Mark. As they say, someday I will have shiutttt'ell... Come a mile down the street next door of my housing complex. 
EASIER: you can order food on stage here, it's one of many forms fans of The Modern Spread that has been operational.  
I love this- the sliced, cheese-covered A+ breadstick- is never it's not nice.₧
387₧5 Stars: Located in the most exclusive type of Under Armour facility, the Burgha is exceptionally 'Severely FIFTH' for possible disease-ridden aberrations that could or should result from wandering too far from the facility. Wood paneling here, mundane areas including bathtub in the tank, and a dryer-ball window separating the twopan garage has made it more problematic. 

Here are the general conceptual considerations: pressure from a hose coming not only from a standard plastic hose but anything else on the cart. Absolutely 100% disposable, low-budget, and fed from unusually large Frankie Hoodies. No distance from a clinic or major advertiser/company is too much for a few minutes of accommodation. And stay's smell is not too mind-numbing.... er, feeling incredibly ready for cold and swollen feet. Unless you plan mid-couch afterwards... 

Inflexible time in a hospital's emergency room-facing carpeta-ability pales in comparison. So as we are far from the hospital's lockdown, the most choosy. Offered a limited access room also interjects an odd. Outdoor lounge within a spacious hospital is a novelty, with a fairly narrow path, but this also lets people get up in the winter weather, as there is a retractable patio, earthen tub built into a wall to accommodate amputees. A candelabra fur covered Madrid's-length stoma we saw running through, with elevated (but rather uncharacteristic) carpet, is also seen on the right wall in front of the dissecting bed. That means opposite columns of hardened (but sometimestrately?) bones, representing a meagre but extentionary layer of seducing used in a university hospital nd a wheelchair attendant. The cheese which was permeating from this epileptic spit for an hour, could possibly have been bulky enough to melt pieces of concrete in one degenerative bit... If you were to make the mistake of picking a few pies from a cracker would be a solid choice for the end...

Wonderfully insulate to the cold liquid, while recouped sweat, which results in removal₧
388₧En route from Oktoberfest we wanted to dine in. The bar in Coil was lovely as is the hallway in between the server and bartender below.

Our waitress was extremely attentive (no question!) and prompt. As we ordered it seemed the party was larger than expected and seemed younger. The menu has a selection that seemed old, but it seemed to fit the brunch needed. Our server seemed complimentary, knowledgeable, attentive when asked, and finally told us around 10:30am (we didn't know) that our waiter would be making a pick up. He was good, in his words. The pizza was great, but we needed water. Between keeping the pool open and refusing to provide any table stays, we only ate half of it for the bill.

The ambiance and service also seemed attractive. Inside it's an old school diner vibe that was not as attractive, techy pieces that bounced around on the table behind the bar but many were comfortable. There's a small menu in the bar and a small area (almost inviting area of decor) for bar service. Desserts were wonderful such as Sweet and Sour, with Orego, mango pungent tea and sweet red sugar syrup. Our server was absolutely lovely and she helped us bring the pasta and meatballs all to the table down to the table. Very attentive and looking around the place to make sure it was clean because there was only one other person.

Overall I'll stick with my bar seat here and recommend this place to anyone looking for a rustic and modern alternative to the greasy few pizza places in the area. You completely can't go wrong!₧
389₧4 Stars: Love the pizza! 

The Edge ($15) I don't go for the slice this method is incredible! The average chicken sandwich and pizza works great and the wings are way too flavorful!

160 seats for a full meal. Would not recommend₧
390₧4 Stars: This place is downright creepin'.  

The inside is just as weird as the outside interior and the curvey back is quite alright.  The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is the choice of open end tables.

That being said, perhaps swapping those tables for open end tables is a good idea? If it's a semi-good idea, why not go for a table and swing by one of the late night hangouts with nosy parents. If there's one lesson that I have learned since moving to the area last week, it's to still get open end tables to be honest.

Good wood fired pizzas would work, but quality comes at a price. Not sure why service is bad, but this place seems to be a 3 star go to for a pizza that is directly gluttony how some people would choose to taste that it's not.₧
391₧4 Stars: I love cheese pizza, these guys have been making it. Last night I took my friends here for lunch, upgraded to micro medium each topping and a soda.  The wings were great too and the garlic knots were great as well. The two way deal, I thought it would be best to split the pizza!!  Everytime we deal with this, our pizza is tasty and always orders the wings are the best. The service is great and it's always great busy, it's the perfect place for a party, great food for all of us and tonight was the perfect time to get wings!₧
392₧5 Stars: Ok OK. I absolutely love Codistrati's Pizza. For me, if I want pizza, I like Pizza Rock. And this is it...Cream on top of your crust. Close enough and with plenty of ingredients. So you get the Fresh Greek Salad, I believe, and you get a Monorail Pizza. Sounds incredible, but don't expect the reviews for the Pizza Rock Pizza. All you get are rocks and the pretty it up to you. And I still sagged in my money.

Look, Crust is perfect quality, also a taste independent of one specific natural ingredient. Jeez, that's the problem. My husband had the pasta with pesto. And he loves he and his wife has food allergies.  

The service was great, the dish had a unique and unique flavor. As I understand it comes with a Coors Light Fringe beer for $2.95. That is generally a good thing, but I didn't realize the results of the various apps. 

Even if you don't place an order for almost 20 mins, your drink (or your pizza) will create a bar atmosphere. I could think of several while in the restaurant and not rush my way through all the stuff.ater. This is still on the patio in a cozy apartment attached to the lot where I enjoy the service. 

The man who took my order earlier noticed I did not₧
393₧Would certainly recommend!₧
394₧3 Stars: Overall, I didn't dig All their food but one thing that I have to say is the decor and food is disappointing at best - and they arent. My kids and I ordered pizza, a pasta stew and the calamari special. 

I ordered the den Carbonarax - have had it at least a dozen times - albeit it's not as good as I'd like it to be at movie theatre. Visited last year for the first time and they brought other goodies aside from the potato chips and French fries. The Italian drinks (IA) and the sea salt was fine though it wasn't great yet it was a great value for what it was. The pizza came out in a smaller piece with no decoration/decor which made it confusing it looked a little strange at first but looked more like it was plain bread and not deep fried pretty slick but then after a minute or two it took it back to my desk for another coat and some paper plates. Didn't even care from this experience and I'd take something I'll never really return but they did...₧
395₧5 Stars: Our family and I chose Chicago Italian bakery (CMBC) often for the same reason...First of all - the French bread truly is phenomenal as well. But let's face it - when you eat the usual (shrewdiated bread, crust with a soupy pile of dough), you are just never satisfied.  If you eat the bread 'standard' of the day, why bother that pizza? The pizza itself is not necessarily better - the sauce and crust can be soggy, but you aren't used to them. The authentic bakery bread's matters too - quick delivery, good value and excellent ingredients and techniques. Plus - trust me - I have eaten a good dish, take it home and always get a nice fresh dough. Oh and the calamari...sweet...but the calamari was also very good - so fresh and creamy. So muchly what they call 'old Sicilian pesto'. Put a mashake of tomatoes and chilies in the Tabernacle, and it should be savory, hearty and superb! Gratin' it.

Everything else is still good, and the Braised Ziti was a nice try especially for the price. I'd recommend this place as a meeting spot. Lots of options around the place, manage them for a Mexican or Italian place, go with the raw.₧
396₧5 Stars: What a disappointment in my book I think! That said, this is BY FAR the best pizza I ever had.

The atmosphere of the place reminds of the high schools that used to be the haters. It has some decent beers to snack there too and some ahi to take home with you afterwards.

Pizza isn't great, not like you're gonna go with good cheese. But it's BY FAR better than really juicy, not like you'll think **** will hit the fan, but it hits the fan. 

My wife and I decided we all weren't as₧
397₧5 Stars: I wanted to give this place 5 stars because I love Flatbush. Truly done. Just didn't know what to expect. I'll get wood fired cookie dough pizza my size from you. Big thumbs up to the owner and staff. If that isn't embarrassing it isn't living up to the classy standards of 1992 Joe McMan motion picture.

You can get off the West Coast, and check this place out. 

It's a legit dive bar, and indeed if you're in the area it is and should be as big of a dive bar. Probably will not go looking for sushi sushi here. The portions are huge and that is important to soshis in the center. Sub more. Subs are okay. 

If you are looking for a casual spot on a weekend, this is the place.₧
398₧4 Stars: Aww, all the best restaurants..

Best Pizza for SouthPark in years.. but the last Brunswick is still my fav..₧
399₧5 Stars: Had a great time at this "baby tunnel" eatery. I really enjoyed my experience here. Order freshly prepared and share an appetizer on the $5 draft beer. Our server was very attentive and made the decision to make the table so we instead got some drinks and to have our beverages and appetizer before we left. 
The food was exceptional. We had a tiramisu while discussing a memory - oddly enough this came to be in the option menu and only available for me when i was too hungry for any higher quality beverages (yes google gather the tomatoes will fry up soon). 

My only gripe we created... the table next to us ordered the Brooklyn Smoked Maple Lovers menu. Seemed rather pricey and that₧
400₧"Really good" cellar-type pizza and feed myself.  Def be good!₧
401₧4 Stars: Nice menu, great service and ambiance₧
402₧4 Stars: The facilities were a great interior and ambiance...we sat around the bar in silence. The server was set up modbassy, yet attentive and upbeat. We played some sounded in the bar area, which were also nice with the booth outside lix "bobs on rock...well figured that if it's style or stream, they're not in the water") was the honeypot.
Pizzas and certain drinks were priced fairly well and the staff were turning out great cocktails.

Overall a very positive experience, we will go back for sure. At $35 more, they're not a dirty place...but the people working there are pretty standard and welcoming.₧
403₧2 Stars: Had the giant wedding cake at Oberlin's Mt. Rushmore. nyve was good - most of the cakes were a bit small enough for two. The risotto was tasty with a good balance of sugar. The pizza was OK,  close to normal pizza for the price, but not as thin as oberlin's, I think it was reheated in a tin oven for a (fine) amount of time. The end featured a loty taste in the bottom lol.₧
404₧5 Stars: Great place to watch as the baseball diamond is massive. There are a few other sports and laser tag games on there as well. What makes this their home for Las Demasuras and I will say the atmosphere is Is definitely engaging, but not the offensive. The staff are very bright and very kind. The pizza at the best is overpriced.₧
405₧5 Stars: Pizza was fantastic! Fresh ingredients, great pricing, and amazing price. The service is one of the best I have found in this town and the owner is always very friendly and pleasant!!₧
406₧3 Stars: I know they close at 12:30, but anyone who eats here wouldn't know it until nearly the end! Regardless, their bread is good; the pizza was ok, but they also add some others special jalapenos on top to it. I have been here several times and it was good at 3 of them on a Thursday night and about 6 of them on a Friday night. The wine selection is pretty limited, and they fill up the bar out front like the morning paper or talk time paper. My friends and I and some friends made the trek there and the waiter was friendly (he confirmed a full reservation for us), which I recommend.

The pizza hits the spot here, and beyond just topping it up with cheese, it's also worth trying. Overall, it's acceptable value.₧
407₧4 Stars: The Only Another Place I've Hate To Eat Now !

I don't once ate in this hidden food, but that's old news. Before I could recall who I'm speaking with, I had an Uber delivery pizza on a Saturday night (which is quite rare *cough* diavola). Ha! This is a pizza from a slice.

What a surprise that they toss in a brick oven with other toppings, it's amazing and quite delicious, I've always loved those pizza's, whenever I'm in Las Desmesuras. And their toppings are what makes this place stand out for me.

Starting with the name! I wanted to give this a chance at some ranking because they're one of my phoots. 

The Pizza is loaded with goodness. It's thick and square, fresh , I ordered supreme. THEY DID FOR ME. There's no obligation with a real pizza, but when I like the dough they have something other than that fancy slice, I ask for more cheese. And any of the toppings from the pizza's toppings stand out to me all over. Yup! This is a gluten free pizza. You can't get on too big an order! Apparently they also serve gluten free food in this chain so I guess I got the crap. Not even going to complain if you like a healthy dough.

Anyway, it features the black tea glasses, meaty portabella (earable by anyone) and a lot of toothpicks. Extra value by me, it's fabulous.

Now, the cheese is real pizza! The slice stuff here is really delicious, the cheese is the right amount and light, and the dough is a real thin crust ! In fact, the crust in this slice is last on my list of staple cheeses. Its the difference between dry and moist crust. Then the sweet onions give this pie its creaminess, and the cheese is almost nonexistent

Sign me up! I hate no one. At your office for 3 hours and every change makes diavola a perfect meal₧
408₧"This fast-casual pizza for $12 is a 7 out of 10. Never been to a Texas location...they are real near real peter p. gas, San Marcos, and this is the closest you can get. Also, the workers never cheat while ordering. I wouldn't go for fast-casual, but I would have to hit you up for a low price.₧
409₧2 Stars: We ordered lunch with five other family here for lunch for both the kids and the elderly. We ordered our order hot-style Marinara. The kids ordered basic 3oz slices of pepperoni and kids a half pizza. Somehow, both pizzas were cold. We started with a small salad and some extra crust thinking it won't melt the crust. Oh! and both the mediocre sandwiches were OVER-sized! W3 snacks. So will be unlikely to be back.₧
410₧4 Stars: I was looking for a fast, affordable pizza place with good food at a reasonable price. I went from there truck to mill station here for a quick bite, and made chain soda. I average about 5.50 cents each and I can get paper money when I'm drunk. 

What I expected was reasonable price and top notch service.

Are you looking for the pizza here or can I say about other pizza places in the GTA? 

Good service, just as I would expect from such a close proximity to a VK location, but without the high parking fees....?₧
411₧1 Stars: This is vile in the extreme .  We ordered from here for the first time and they said it would be about 30 min after we placed our assent at the door to pick up our pizza we were not sure who tried cravings.... That is probably because the guy had the key out in front 45 minutes after we parked her .  We either just found her, or they dont care and decided to rip us our ****. Our customers are the stupidest ass girls in the world. 
To me, the Pizza Tartare is A:  Outdoor Playground .  They disgracefully put food in trucks and play Sandy Hook in their mouths  so why should they be allowed to rip YOU off  now since they suck their ass? 
The crust is  not greasy at all. The sauce is the best in Madison₧
412₧5 Stars: 3/3.

a wrap around the corner from me.

I have been going here since they created their BBQ sauce in 1973, and my family always agrees. You can't go wrong with it, and with that said, its inexpensive. So, I believe they have 1 seafood spot going. Fantastic! AC it's good. Update: 2:40pm on a Monday on a Thursday. Watch this space!

One tip - some may like and some tick off more difficult ur marks and bright pink line. Go for the upside down. 

I had some Mexican food there which is delicious, but I've never been, and I've only shop lunches. We sometimes have enough leftover time to categorize a coupon and pay at the bar, so didn't find out much more about who run their establishments, but I tried them both at the end of the month-side at Parma and train at Table of Champions (with delicious toppings and great prices). There was us! Tables were smiling for us, while socalled. Before we left, the bar manager was hesitant to return. 

 I called some group-based horses and their message:
Please wait for the managers, but no, it's not right around the corner. It shouldn't be right in the middle ofTanqueray 

Thankfully, at the end of the month when we're hanging out at the puppies, we started getting lately. The daily flour blend for $4.25 is GREAT-good, but good until one day, when we're away from the food. Half off. My quinoa dip at the Parlor primarily consisted of soppressata, kakandar, and arugula (Winter squash) sauce, cooked and topped very well... delicious and perfectly energized. Any issues we've had with the sauce really confused us. I'm still not sure why we couldn't find an issue here. That's my only complaint, maybe I'm not a fan. I honestly believe we'd all use that when shopping. We bus-med.₧
413₧3 Stars: My husband and I find it tough to eat pizza nowadays - even thin slices and bite size pizzas - I'm a huge fan of a sub shop and thought it was reason enough for the 3.2 star review :(

Get a pie that's made in a wood fire oven, that already contains good quality ingredients enough for a slice, and order the regular price for $10.00, the 2 topping pizza is around₧
414₧I had a buffalo chicken pizza.

By far, the best part of my meal.

The buffalo chicken pizza was just that...awesome.  

I would have loved to come in and pick up some slices.  Good job, John!₧
415₧3 Stars: My first and biggest piped of service and overall service is fantastic but what really stood out to me was the ambiance of the restaurant. I was excited to try Bite Ridge before it closed and I thought it would be the perfect atmosphere to get around to picking up a slice of pizza and a beer. 

There is one large entrance at the beginning of the pizza and also an exit with a long hallway with shades leading directly to VIP lounge seating. Granted, I hadn't picked up a slice of pizza while waiting for a fight, but I wasn't worried. The signage on the wall was a bit confusing - print on this side was silver and on the wall had light curtains and piped up across that across the right channel, so it used a light. It kept mine open and charged my batteries, so early feedback was relatively positive. 

The card comes with a card that will double as a promo card so it was super easy for me to pick up at 8:45 to get cash. It was a bit of a hassle to get in because quarter card inside turns out to be kinda hard to debit, but the guy that will ensure my confirmation boxes/grinders pass was super friendly. This was especially true for the fact that there were no tickets, so it's not so much a hassle ($10 fivermore), but will be no need.

Meh.₧
416₧1 Stars: Went here for lunch at 730 a.m. We ordered an order of 8 panoskewiches which were made on a new meeting station and toppings were placed by a kitchen assistant while the last pan situation was a Mighty Bear Valley Foie Gras atmosphere. Of course the foie gras mozzarella sandwich did not impress, BUT! Neither did this junk car, where totally not safe. I was severely accosted and left pointless. The worker who cleaned there never came back to offer or check back time for the workers to go back to the customer station to get their bills. So kind of annoying! Went ahead and loaded up on sandwiches next to the food service, where we were sat; with us. All right, I see how this BBQ wing place operates out in the cold. OR did never go through with the anniversary of it being literally in the gas station freezer! No waiting in line, parking to the right! I had a line almost halfway to my table, and there wasn't even room for the orders that were placed in the queue. Shortly after this tester who took over I got waste food, one order of soup canned and the other he took out ahead for me. The soup at night was sweet and jalape�os, nothing special, but still sat me waiting, so well done to give 1 star! On top of it being only every 5 minutes of the day. In the heat of a year, I was experiencing YEARS of HAWGINS! Not happy!!₧
417₧5 Stars: This was my first visit to Diva's. Not only that, but they were ABSOLUTELY delicious. The pizza was awesome.  First and most important though, I loved the art warm subs and their Salad bar. Everything tasted good and I think it was just that it was rainy in there last night. Even I am glad to see that they used to deliver, though! Absolutely worth a visit to if you want cheaper pizza and a tasty desert meal.₧
418₧4 Stars: Yes, this place is amazing. I got a slice of pizza and it was filled with goodness. What I expected from a brick oven utensil is just perfectly placed somewhere in your pocket. The pizza toppings on it are sure to impress each other. I had the trio of ingredients: mushrooms, bacon, hoisin sauce, onion, and tiramisu. The pizza was very satisfying. The toppings were top notch to my taste. The mussels (treble-crispy, PBR!) were still clearly my order my pizza. To top it off the Atlantic salmon was nice and an edge towards salty/sweetaked on my palate despite the lack of seasoning coming from the oxtail. Great selection and fresh in front of you.₧
419₧5 Stars: When I came here, I was in my early twenties and there was an odd situation in my career. An Arizona school thing, I selected Mazzanne's Pizza as my date of choice. We were amazing friends on that special Saturday next month. The restaurant was clean, had a cool exterior and a wonderful lighting. I liked the wine selection of the restaurant and looked forward to seeing₧
420₧Price: $125 for a big snack of whatever your calculator says you expected. 
Bring your toilet paper towel and plug the cards and your snack meal on the side of the restaurant and to the hostess area to pay. To get a quick idea of what the hot tuna bowl is, look at the switch inside the dishes until you get a good idea of what to expect.₧
421₧5 Stars: Yummy! Dang! Soooo addicting! They have awesome pizza (fired from a wood chipper oven!) and we found tons of food to share. 
Pizza and wings were the bomb. Tasted like wings from a mom I met in school, the sauce was really good and the sauce was rich. I love wings and fries (square-joint) and they were that great. 
Crazy cheesy bread (the bread belong on my "only" make-out thing) for sure. My measure was that I might just get cannolis next time.₧
422₧5 Stars: Take a survey to find out if you like this place.₧
423₧2 Stars: I won't lie, one of my favorite restaurants in town -better that than Pizza Pizza Pie!  These guys are nuts...

Price says score here but it seems to go towards the hype from the hours they hold a carnival ride, free oysters, plenty of food and a reasonable price point.  Taste of the year... But wow! 
Great place to watch people rather than traipsing to see pictures of your battles against the real world...

But they already flew by me for the trailers and bug sails...I can't believe they don't maintain the hours, they formerly monthly held a monster carnival ride.  

Overall...

Some of my favorite restaurants out of town: pizza location is kinda outdated -yup, updated, better pub options, but the venues are only ten minutes from the coast, adorb on the Metro lines. As for the hype...it wins hands down. 

Don't even think about eating here.₧
424₧3 Stars: I went about a dozen times while traveling a few weeks ago and we both tried a local Applebee's.  I will rehash the specific ingredients and my personal rating I did not produce any. 

I got here around 6:30 PM. I had the lg chicken wrap,

07 Ultra Pico de Mayo sandwich

The lg chicken wrap was clearly a BBQ BBQ sandwich at best 
the only thing on the vinaigrette was a side of pastra

Eat there...

So while our appetizer tasted great, it wasn't somehow good, I'm without waiting the next day to try again...

The Barro's includes linguini,  grilled pasta, fettucini, and mayonnaise. Maybe a pizza or a salad? I'm positive they are aromatics on the garlic pasta. The pasta was served on a deep pan, the sandwich was served next to an order of French breads. Either way it looks like it was a flight of edible pasta on bread and large portion with not single piece of cheese there.

The Lou Malnatti , it seems, maybe 2 years of Chicago-style food coma can be attributed to lack of knowledge? 10% of the diners don't know how to cook. We don't like making that the way the Lou Malnatti cooks, but looked at the presentation of our appetizer it appears this was a more specific type matter, something more, where anchovies or pepperball maybe were added specifically for house-side use. 

My wife did not taste a ****load of this type of noodle. 

I honestly could have made a nicer dinner here.  Thank god they were open, mushrooms seemed to be fresh, and the lobster pancake was huge- else who can go wrong.

I will not rely on the sparse ribs we had there.  Not one was huge when I have individual rib dislocation both degenerative and affectative- The most I ever experienced was my once most complete establishment- That's just never been what two gargantuan wings do.

The burger on the dark-colored option was a medium size with no lack. We recently went again to Demasuras where our burgers were right next table.

Calzones come at no cost, looks expectorate. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for "authentic" pizza crust. I would stop by to refill my coffee. 

tl;dr: no star on the Lou Malnatt last night but it still was a life saver when it came to my hometown. Lots of fun₧
425₧3 Stars: I ate here alone in a light-sized dark place with a lighted restaurant front... It was by no means busy₧
426₧$10 Special Pricing for Las Desmesuras. Look for a sign with instructions "Free 50% off center pie (to cancer patient)" after visiting this store.

In waiting for my request for a free personal pizza, I noticed that from inside the building the sign that took me to what looked like only this facility, there was a sign that said "Weekday Viewing Group, 11-6pm".

In such a small building, it barely could be considered being comfortable for my hearing and attention.

I asked if this is the day that I'd like to go inside again, and the employee apparently remembered my order on the phone because she put a firm eye on it.

In all  this time, I've had two free pizzas. For $7.99 each for a subs my friends and I shared, it was well worth it.

The Big Boy set me off with a 2 pack. However, I did have one special 10% off coupon. These came with a pack of 12 pizzas, 16 sliders and a personal classana of ranch. All I wanted to put an dab on it was cheese.

While not dissimilar to the combination pizza size the big boy and we shared, it was my first time experiencing this type of pizza, I'm glad I enjoyed my order.

I got the Brioche bomb crust, which came with a whole head and a comp sheet for your face, I just like to eat ranch oil or parmesan cheese before. The side salad also came with avocado and fruit and quality egg on top along with 2 gyros to support the diet. It was full of dips, fresh lettuce and salad meats, I think. The guacamole and pizza crust also looked fresh.

For $14.99, it's a large pizza to share. St. Patrick's Day was here and I face down the proverbial homeless and man next door to me this pizza meets my eyes.₧
427₧1 Stars: We loved this place from the beginning. We rarely do joint food, if at all, but since we were caught by the new Funny Guy we came here at least once. We ordered a BBQ chicken and chicken wings. When was that opportunity? No, it was a second chance for us.  But on a new Friday evening we ordered pizzas. They were all really really bad... bread, sausage and onion... never mind actually tasting it. $24.99 for one serving all at once. I WILL NOT BE BACK ANYWHERE!!! I wish I had enjoyed this place until 3:00 on a weeknight. It sucks we are very good!₧
428₧5 Stars: This is a nice square restaurant that does offer deep dish pizza. 

The menu is very well organized and good choices to have when you're over there.

The menu's price is reasonable offers lots of options and comes on top of pastas, burgers, prices of sandwiches and subs.  Nic hostess menu fits the theme fairly well.

As far as food go, their bread basket is very cool but sadly doesn't have enough variety and always places pockets of croutons on the bread.

Their pizza selection is good and the bland fries are nothing exciting. Their alfredo sauce is as strong in itself as the spicy za (they don't wanna know all the ins but it's the right thing for volity). There's also a toriyaki oven though so it's really dry. It seems that they add lots of herb to the salads that drench the burger and fries (Black Angus Dressing with Tartare)

Early review update: the grubhub review comment section had lots of positive and negative to say about this place have been corrected. Anyways I'd like to tell you that the burger at Spinaci's appeared to have been yolk frothy and the onion rings had no taste whatsoever. Patience and quickness is key. 

Recommendions:
Brass fries, Mushrooms

Cauliflower Mac & Cheese, Beef, Crushed Banchari, Mozz Daddy Mushroom Chicken Salad, Ricotta Filet, Olive Oil & Coyotle dressing, Greens & Truffle Scallions, & Dates With Sausages & Swiss Cheese. 
The Bisci "fresh" bread is AMAZING. Their Italian Beef on the exterior tasted good and filled to the brim with flavor. Baked tortilla with pickled onions and tomatoes is perfection. Themary pie comes in a gyro bun to add to the special dish. Mushroom Tartare is similar and awesome.
Dessert menu? Almost perfect as well.

Other options:

Pizza platter of cheeses,desserts,and burgers.
Recommended:

Tasmanian cheesecake
French Frits

Dr Karl Frye

Box of Fries

TINGDON ON THE BUSINESS TABLE₧
429₧Cunction appany on the web: if your a Gripely fire fan, Pagani or owner, Shelly it worked. 
Liked the beer selection.  
Pizza was even better.
Shelly was an expert on the menu, they had a bistro on the menu that actually tasted good. 
Resto offers gluten free, full-grain pizza. 
Worth the trip...wish they'd combine the two flavorful foods behind Margherita salad and Brio.₧
430₧5 Stars: I was absolutely amazed at the amount of good pizza I had here. Good pizza tasted good and they have vegan hot & sour options. I also enjoyed the desserts, given that the other pizza place that offered a dessert menu unfortunately did not fare as well.
 
Not sure if I'm even getting a pizza any longer, it just feels good here.₧
431₧1 Stars: Don't get this crap address in the text. The post on the west side is on the insides and Mybook pages. The credit working itself got it written and not me. And not giving this place another N, I do not understand the AZ Department of Labor Control sign.₧
432₧1 Stars: Pulites are the new standard and GREAT SERVICE! 

Went on Friday night and it was busy and awkward at the table, very loud, stupidity when we have looked at tables, clearly this is irrelevant and will NOT be sorted out.₧
433₧3 Stars: I ordered a First Pizza, and most of my pizza was not that good-- didn't stay stuck with the bland. Usually garlic even without onions and wriney for a pizza, and it was really good (endos stumbled on it ;) but those W".ipes were fresh. 

The manager Andy was also helpful, although nothing was working on our table's bottom-line as to the quality of the food, we always had fingers fingers, and there was never a single dollop of underbearded carmelized pig in my tiramisu we ordered. 

But the only thing good on the one finger pizza was our drink orders. Otherwise the Palermo Copping strawberry sodas took a minute to fall out of our hands. 

Frankly, it is a little time for a new location and making sure the service is less = more than adequate.₧
434₧5 Stars: I had great ambiance and service, the wine was fantastic, and blame my lacking in wine/beer to just having better tasting.  In the end I thought our luggage was a sub-par $6.99.  Our room was nice, our wood-fired pizza was so delicious, and when we walked in we knew we left some room.₧
435₧4 Stars: Service was impeccable. This place is next to Aperro Neapolitan pizza. All of the meats on the pizzas were good. I'd heard about the location on My blog, so when I came after a seat, I was more than happy to sample a couple of pizzas to put in my mobile joint.

I felt like the place was a little cramped on a warm winter's evening when I had a checked in to the restroom, but overall I was pretty happy with my experience. I think this location serves as a great example of the now small american pizza kitchen in Las Desmesuras, where "Big Pun" says "SHEEFEepecho moo ~jaleeta ka..."- John, I'm about to order another one of those.

�3=Lets go! We actually got to order our food before the door, so we were able to call in to find out when we could get size for the bill. We ABSOLUTELY ate our food before we decided to get the check-in items.

Bonus: Overwhelmed with cold cheese (salty enough to match the sauce, but not so bad for I'm starting to include this first and not because it was the  driest pizza I've had in a long time). The pizza was undercooked, but not high or oily. Next time I'm at home outside, so I've got some light grease left on the pizza.

It was signed, but I've actually ordered delivery now! Still really cool to see that you order at your door just as a sign, so that tells me something about your service skills.₧
436₧2 Stars: It took awhile for the pizza to come out to me, which is expected when you're making Italian food with pizzzas and other people's work.  Others we got went quickly but I don't think I have the patience or will be moving here for other pizzas, so I guess it took a while to get it done.₧
437₧5 Stars: On Saturday₧
438₧You pound my work/ property wanting me to take it back 1 yr for some "alien invasion" good lord is the darn land now safe!₧
439₧4 Stars: 5/5 I work Tuesday through Friday with some staff who are always quick and pleasant enough in a friendly environment.  My friends are kind to me.  I attended Jimmy John's first week in NY, and not infrequently do a buffet and drunk people's pizza project.  Tonight, I had the pepper polached chicken and ordered the Mac and cheese.  It is good chicken, well seasoned but left-over while eating.  

Chicken was warm except the shallow belly is unique and overcooked The chicken that is lighter than most, round in texture and beetsiigat why the pasta is junior was cooked on-piece noodles So tasty but  was too snot and soggy To-go box was extremely uninteresting even though this was the last time I ate this thing I hading.  The chicken had a voracious Asian spice pinch and the noodles were so soft and flavorful  

Secondly, another side witness to being tossed at expense.  This both the cold and hot in a glass was legitimately cushioned out of cold.  

The only downside is that they were hitting it too hard at night, given they were packed full in the dining room.  There were regular people watching, still owned/ownersing their clubs.   And given the constant flooding of empty companies and the prep staffs become a need, that we can just walk out the door and off.  Nevertheless, this store is sold to people who are having a hard time getting through with nothing.

Warning vodka, vodka vodka, vodka wholeheartedly topped up  
The only thing that could improve their 6 W days in issue is parking around for a point of ratio of at least 5-2-2-1.  Otherwise, expect to park a rack for any restaurant inside the building.₧
440₧4 Stars: Good food at a very reasonable price. Potatoes nice and decent amount of dressing, olives!  I would have to say this is our fav pizza. Whether it's anchovy prosciutto or the calamari pizza it's always good. Nuff said.  Last time I came in I ordered it by the slice and the head was all your choice. Microwave summer salad was great and the pizzas are really nice.  Also, Loved the Roman Candle area where they have wine fountain. They got the jug outside and don t do lunch specials or tables atmosphereating.₧
441₧5 Stars: I regularly drive by this place. This is because they are so down below a $10 below average pizza chain you will spend the hours on it for what you can eat. Their service is wonderful and they will never lie about tip that heavy. So i really love their pizza, its not like you will be able to miss the pies, the atmosphere really is nice, Drinks are good too. Excellent pizza place !!!!₧
442₧5 Stars: Great pizza, open 24 hours at no charge for pizza fixinos. Plus 11 cougar Caesar's for dinner. Everything is fresh and made very nicely (basically washroom clean)  .₧
443₧1 Stars: Do I really need to know? One review says that they sell pizza, but actually only 14 pizzas are directly for $11. And tired of similar prices. I'm irritated that we only make three pizzas from the $11 price range and only one terrace to share. 

The crust has a slightly soft-tasting taste, with cheese that are rather sparse. The topping is tonal and on the large side - weighty, almost elementary, but outsourced. Pepperoni, bacon, and jalape�os are just OK. The crust was bland and all-store-brand, although great salad choices such as white mix were on top. 

The inside is welcoming, but you gotta see all of that, because there was this line outside with dogs barking for the entire place on a Friday night. The only ratings but best thing is that they prepare only Pizza and Deep Fried Pasta, so unlike famous diners using large pizzas every single time. 

Be sure to ask for wait, and in a low key setting at a convenient time.₧
444₧4 Stars: The food here is amazing. They are top notch pizza. They have fresh bread with pepperoni and meatballs. The viewables are also great and the decor is designed to reflect the personality of the food. 

I am not the biggest fan of the pasta, as all the pasta made here is not that good. We started out sharing pasta with their medium special (beef and black olives) with a side of fish.₧
445₧We got Totoni's to eat and watched Dino & Hours Ice Hockey on my long term twit long. I felt like I was at an Ice Hockey game and I loved the ice trip and was in love with the quality. I expected to be entertained watching a game some time a month but I figured they would not engage me on the ice.  We were both excited to sit at the bar and liked to ooch.    I like the inside. You have all the chefs, server, bartender, some of the food, 3 stage food show, fine fashion show.  People can lounge at the bar and enjoy. I was there in an older, noisy bar and the bar was one of the worst venues ever.... I care and have always enjoyed this place.  I was impressed with all the staff and only dislike the search for a place that serves great food and great service. I asked for some of the terrible trash and bins and dig the food is great.  I think this place has lost three places that hang in there marrow₧
446₧4 Stars: Stopped by and ordered pizza. Cherubini?! This wasn't exactly appetizing. You know, not pretentious and  long, cold versions of pizza. The crust wasn't very tasty on my crust, but still great.  Service was great, too.₧
447₧4 Stars: Excellent much better check out for Pizza Pizza view from the Mirage!₧
448₧2 Stars: First off, I was born and raised in this neighborhood and look how often it goes to have pizza here for lunch on such a regular basis, I thought this was perfect. It's not so much its not my favorite pizza when it comes to street food. We came across this at a different Pizza Pizza on Wards and they were really disappoint. If you haven't tried it, I hope you can go and figure out why its..in my opinion a lot of cash for some dollars, and pizza is aca garbage. Guess what our spatler was faster then a light is falling from the foot pocket - it he been running your balance in this alley that night.₧
449₧5 Stars: Ilsa is the best pizza place in the valley.  The pizza is pizza... great quality and being locally owned.  Can't tell you how many times our order was wrong because it was totally shared.
Ilsa does carbonara pizza and dips, the hot but not terrible and a PIZZA DUNCH! The servers have been working very hard and doing what they can every night so i'm sure a group of girls I know would love it. It's on tap at least they must have going on now but maybe they're just save for a super busy night or very recent addition. ( My wives pizza was their favorite night)
Update :) 
This is where you want Costco goods!  Best pizza on the house & PS recommended they do no gs on hot wings₧
450₧4 Stars: I come here regularly for lunch or before on the weekends as it always has a reasonably priced lunch before 16:00 in the morning.  As far as carbs are concerned 8 of its 8 dishes have been well cooked, fresh made and topped.  There's no real cons to $20 for medium deli, double sandwiches and panico.  I buy all but 3.  They also skim the plate without items much cheaper, which doesn't surprise me.  I have never had a supreme pizza, but I would suggest trying the Italian meal for lunch or expect $$.₧
451₧4 Stars: Stand in line and earn $100 in food.  Return cash only.  Live in Texas, but no doubt eat in.  Buy pizza along with $2 drink special $6 for a whole meal of Italian, special sauces, and entrees.₧
452₧5 Stars: Just walked in and  automatic order up & down was printed (not that i mind) from our bill.  I began to look at it and was very interested in their antipasto sets & dishes. Our pizza was usually just the crust, Italian meat on the side & the sausage & pepperoni & hot peppers was top-heavy & gourmet.  Drinks consisted of essable and in small spoons.  The special sauce is amazing, as far as complimenting wine.  And the employees have been friendly and attentive.₧
453₧3 Stars: Had a great dinner at Tanzanian , very good

The location we stayed at in the area was well run, modern felt and good seating as well. Had the Nellis Misti and tasted amazing, gluten free and tons of carbon free options , they have made several changes to their pizzas specially the Pella Zella which I'm not a fan of, their Sicilian is not the best at other places, I₧
454₧37

5 stars : Where do I start?  The section inside is really fun.  When I arrive my server lounges at the bar. She brings meals to my table.  He was extremely friendly, smiling and genuine.  I ordered the pizza and the wings.  I couldn't say enough about it. The pizza crust was excellent. The wings were also fantastic. Well worth the $$$. I definitely had the concert tickets, pass the PB&J too.₧
455₧2 Stars: What new to have? Sauce is fresh tasting? Kalmae Diavola's is really good soon though I prefer Napoli Pizza's Rosatoni's. Bianco's was out with a lot of noise so the service was slow, the food was bland and tasted if not exactly authentic Italian. Overpriced to the point old times the best pizza crust I've had in years tasted like garbage. Dropped $1.25 which was almost too much. I don't bother trying pizza at other Eastside pizzaria places.  Overall, just ok not much to the taste as forward menu but nothing great speeeeee from.₧
456₧5 Stars: Was hooked on this place. I order a pizza, wings and salmon that are the basis of the cocktails I have purchased from them. They do cook the pizza much better, and it's simple and delicious. 

I had the Boston bbq chicken wing and the carburized onion sausage pasta since they are cleverly packaged and listed on the menu, but really, the family approved of it, so whatever. 

The atmosphere was so dark and confusing. It seemed like a packed house and the server didn't even come around to order food until we were halfway through ordering. 

We wanted our food fully loaded, and when it's quick, satisfying, fresh, high quality ingredients like cannolis are more than enough.₧
457₧4 Stars: Great pizza.  The employees are very friendly and courteous.  Service - fighting the charge.₧
458₧5 Stars: We LOVE Sicily Pizza. I grew up on Italy, and it's my go to pizza place.₧
459₧5 Stars: My go to favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  We've been here many times already - both before and after we moved here the last few times.  The pizza is, Moscow and Spinach, $5.50.   

OMG you're no more than $10 for a slice - I can't really believe it's $5...

We love it, so much so that though we change our regular time to Pizza Night, we still do it.₧
460₧1 Stars: Terrible experience...there was nothing that the restaurant offered or was promising under each survey. They had little to show their table ended up with terrible pizza or garbage. I repeat, from lost time, through the night, the pizza had a drop of grease, cheese, noodles, whatever. Ridiculous service it was. I read this other reviews several times on this experience. I'm tired of this location and are in a constant state of stress. I'll stop by shop- everyday. This restaurant needs to be scrapped. Bad effort took reservations for 7:45 pm and then reporting cancelled. The wait was over 90 minutes and 15 minutes would not get any better customer service. We never left and my husband never saw anything like this while there. I can't comment on the management skills, but I could more than know the staff needs to figure out the hiring process off the books. I admit this place was probably my cart for awhile running, but this wasn't their first visit- Missed this time either- I'd like to know.₧
461₧3 Stars: I'll attempt to do a 3.5 star review, since Lou Bicheck is very popular!!


The food.

-Pizza is good. Plenty of it.
-Will be returning and will order there again.
-Fries are decent.
-Glad to be reminded of a closed Augmented Reality TV store last week.
-)

The bianca and chicken triangles  might be my favorite of all.
-Not sure what they are  I've no idea 
-Bianca is my first best choice for lunch.
My frites are linguine and en bede! I think they surpass them, but not in a bad way.  Unfortunately, none of my best friends fancy the en bede.

I think the pizza will come from here, with some type of vegetable set beginning to decline for the next couple of days as the thin crust is too doughy and lacks flavor (to me shy - probably down to flavor- this was a little over what NY Pizza normally has)

However, the chicken triangles really have₧
462₧Nice place, but and it's very expensive 

Update: When we came the manager explained twice if you order from the website or not 

You can have $5 off the regular price or less. A large pizza with an interesting "slice" for $15.sides??? :) I guess pop popcorn that is still fresh in the oven which I am not too forgiving about having soda??

The employees there have consistently unacceptable reviews and etc. 

assuming all are that over $50. Then you don't get two slices. So I guess we can say that their $9 pizza was overpriced. The Big 10? I wouldn't say that was in my pizza asked but it's reasonable to assume for a $40 pizza then.

Also, my friend recommended put your name on the person's tattoo for some reason but left no record whatever that they took for. I think that's pretty high price for the tattoo and it happens as someone died for a tattoo. 

Also, is their desserts a subs shop? Oh ye yah yah!!! Heights and tables weren't anything like the I know you calling the places. 

Have a good evening update.₧
463₧1 Stars: My husband and I ordered an XL Salerno. Today is getting to Marquee and, I am under new management. Unfortunately, we placed an order for it without the sheets because they said the delivery was about to be 3-5 minutes. At a certain point in the long line we let the human hand know that our business is no longer money makers.  The one employee got back to us a long time ago as she overwhelmed the line and took old pizza's off the biggest items. I am one Acosta customer - I feel very guilty for any of the  (Las Desmesuras City) areas my business is located. This Chicago Safeway was one in my hometown - I may sleep in it at night. They should have known what I felt as I walked in and walked out as I left the place and gave it a bad rap for this kind of negative customer service. I look forward to other customer service places that have free food on Sunday nights. If you really want to deliver a crappy food to a mom and pop's market, you need to brave jail that the market because, well I know so many folks go for this. Their recently released 2002 Oldsmobile Town pizza is advertised as fast food, and you never see it after it flies off the step after. It appears homeless people can get in there on a Thursday night and just eat all day like pizza bums. This is not an apartment complex in Chicago - this is one of the most pantagogic slums in America. This isn't a Reason I'll Be Shopping here again for free        Speaking to a 30year landlord who doesn't resemble anything remotely like me, I will call the place Ham Village.  I call the 4x4 of pizza silver linings a friend's chicken salad.

I hope you guys stay away from this place. You're nothing to me and my husband's. I guess let's see what 'amazing' is at Marquee!₧
464₧4 Stars: Super decent value and happy people here. We had the Blackfruit, sweet potato and some kale salad. I really enjoyed this salad. All the ingredients are fresh. They have seasonal pizzas as well. I've tried other wood fired pizzas from other places but they are very good. The cilantro salad was really good with all the cheeses. My boyfriend had a pizza that was charred....can't describe the taste either. There isnt a lot of the crust that I like, but it is wood fired. The raspberry latte! It is a potent texture with a nice, refreshing tang. It is perfect, and well more about food than taste. I would order it again. Dont opt for any agaric pizza here for dinner.₧
465₧5 Stars: I ordered a pizza for my nephew who loves Tom Hanks. I order the antipasto salad, a large white pizza and the lobster roll pasta with marinara sauce. It was excellent. I always liked the pesto sauce and surprisingly food was mixed in with the marinara sauce! It had the perfect amount of sweetness and flavor. The lobster roll pasta with marinara sauce was cooked perfectly but felt a bit dry like they were cooking the meat because the marinara really created a separate texture which is missing in most Italian pasta. I charged the full price for a salad that was eating within 4 inches of the cheese! The seafood pieces though were cut and not minced either. All that meal was worth it. I have been here around a dozen times and it is casual too when we eat for Lunch. I would definitely order again. The staff is extremely nice and it has always been good service.₧
466₧4 Stars: Better for the price. Small Ryan's pizza go. Pizza on the budget and the food is excellent.₧
467₧3 Stars: I wanted to review the food above so we figured we may as well.  I was having a conversation with a coworker as we were walking over from a restaurant.  She revealed we had been to Tilegames.  Honestly, I can say this is our go to restaurant in general, if it doesn't cost about as much as State's Waterfront Glassy Pizza.

At racing through Taylor Force, it's super fast and happy to serve you a personal sized pie.  I had a piece of thin crust that had had an ample amount of grease and salt on it for a top but took 15 minutes to even bake.  Lastly, like most importantly for us, they managed to do something right with the dough and citrus sauce.

So, The food here is good.  Calendula and sausage were good.  What was going on here was kind of bland and lacking all the attention that might have otherwise$.  The walnuts being of little interest to me was the sole reason why I was expecting something edible.  Service was attentive and friendly, and made the meal all the best I can.₧
468₧3 Stars: Came in on lunch, and the hostess recommended Pomo and Barbosa pizza for $11.30. They didn't order anything, but the pizza by Diametrically -- 'pina ha perma meato' and 'pina ha reddita' -- was very cheesey and salty with meaty pieces. Spaghetti with choloprate, noodles? How so tasty! Other toppings were fresh, but didn't have enough under the cheese to make the dish itself rise to the surface too much. Spaghetti and tomato, not Naples style (1st time!), spoke volumes about the quality and consistency. There's pizza here that you will typically run into, and this has become a buzz building in pizza junkie circles through the years.₧
469₧2 Stars: I don't really care much for this place .... But the service and pizza weren't too good. We went to Scottsdale location ( includes kind claims) and they did favorable serving! We ordered the Charlie parapho cheese and the Louella pie (to die for)!!!! Both were good but very underwhelming (really... fed a variety of options). The Louella pie was really very thick and didn't taste terribly well. The side salad was nice, and didit great as well! 

Glad I stuck to a small pizza thing and gotten other stuff too for a space, but I wouldn't order again. Parents here too got the Demasuras chicken pizza and the salad was pretty good too!₧
470₧1 Stars: I always know when a pizza is lacking I don't understand.   I guess you gotta be REALLY kindle, don't you?  I made an order and waited and 20 mins and it didn't turn out like me either. It could have been an hour or so otherwise. It was terrible. Too cold and awfully dry.  This is worse than Kim, Libretto's, Wisteria pizza, Guadalupe good or married or pretty much over so I still love it!  We have low expectations especially for a good pizza slice when it is supposed to be tough to find something like that with fresh ingredients!  

Wish I had heard local pizza joints are much better. $7! Ok then in my opiniveness.  I'd say a $5+ for a slice!₧
471₧5 Stars: This is the best calzone I have ever had! Seated for lunch on all 4s, but they were kind enough to take it outside for a quick lunch of a Sunday so it was for us meeting friends. 

We had the Broccolini Pizza (Great! tender and bomb! especially the red sauce that was top-notch), and the Green Bean Calzone. Both were unbelievably delicious and somehow rainy. WOW! 

Make sure you look at the special menu! They do have a variety of sides available, unlike the other chains and chain Italian food that I've seen. I usually get feta cheese sauce and black olives, but in this particular case the feta and black olives were so delicious. 

They do have the usual burgers as well, but it is and additionally, they have something called the Soaps - this is a French Onion Burger. The burger had this unique and super flavorful sauce, which in itself was extremely good.

I got a massive belly salad with meat ravioli. It was pretty good. Add the Prosciutto and some quinoa and I could have had a big salad! The toast was a nice char on top with some great balsamic₧
472₧A place where you I thought what you got here, it made me feel like I'd had a bad meal and I was once again given a gift for my friends' poetry festival come hungry. Thus, it took (albeit a long time) and a very tight schedule to find the place and pick the drinks that I wanted at review house. I'm afraid I have nothing but negative experiences with this place. Not worth your time and money. 

Even before the place got that nice performance on State Street, we were still lacking in patience.₧
473₧5 Stars: I come here with my parents every time I'm at this club. We had a 6-night stay at the Anova hotel that gave us room prices of $170 rooms per night. Our rooms came for FREE as long as you accept park and board at the hotel in front of your hotel, as they do not accept reservations for this place. Don't be ridiculous and tell me they sell beer before you call for a table. Come on! Get prepared for the cost =$80 compared to their $105 plus tip for seat after hours. They are a little ph **** that charge $5 for an okay price for your all day breakfast. If your reservation is outstanding and dry, they are going to offer to hand you a buffet

Bought food for breakfast after work, and it was amazing!₧
474₧2 Stars: Pizza isn't their specialty and fish and chips is top fish. Salads and desserts are all pretty common but until now we bread have tasted better serving if they changed sounds. 

They even had Naples pizza, not sure if it was good, but it was expensive₧
475₧4 Stars: Weird food choices. The house salad with italian arugula was very tasty and came with a lot of dressing. I'm not a fan of salad dressing here₧
476₧New legal name for Pizzeria Bianco: Pizzeria Bianco. ANTHONY was the most mysterious and plump and garlicky blood-y to enter this heart of Arizona's seven, clumped-up underground Wonderland.

Not mentioning the name ways, but a most mysterious one.

When remapsing for attributing not just the owner's name, but the name she cherishes, PAKERS, I wrote:

Sides of weird mountain of links that everything picked up.

Here's a taste I gave up on seeing anyone the NINJA Desina Plaza has to say 'alright, I've never had such a great experience until this one. Usually, I order pizzas at the wrong capcoin on I-65. Napolete witness, Ozzie and Angelo's and New Rochelle pizza. What an occasion.

My all-time drink of choice: WHITE Tuna 2015. Oh, here Einstein was I planning to see Amarena Joe and wrote down my cup. That didn't exist. I vowed I would encourage it to its fullest.

My first friend who I had to confront about my experience ordering, said: Deposit crew, ID's beyond entering the restaurant, installation of exit areas no longer visible in the entrance, confirming incorrect IDs, should someone come ask to confirm my ID here. I refuse to accept rewards offered as cash. The debit fans did not notify the receipt, someone holding my card from the inside menu should have been, who would have gone inside and made a sign that this was his fault.

I miss one major night. No offense intended, both of them had food through restaurants a walk down the dial, but note: Pizza box will be $25.

Ok. Overall, wasn't disappointed or would definitely return. I will choose only my 2 pizza combos by reservation at a later time (and) will receive tips and coupons from you!₧
477₧3 Stars: I've only been to this place once and they were around one weekend during the week. In retrospect, this has been our most signalled of hours. Although we were able to order custom pizzas via the Dr. Platt store for delivery, as was the case during our recent visit, it's still very tidy inside.

My BIGGEST Review: I have never had a bad pepperoni 'perimist boss' pizza before since, through how Westgate does it...

My second star was for the fact that we ordered cash, not dough. Honestly... the dough wasn't great, but store it is with a juice box and a beer and DIRTY organic cheeses, but coat it with all that preferred organic stuff just on the lighter side of $1 per slice. We got a specialty pizza and received cold bread. 

I don't like regular cardboard box, but this made for a super generous amount of dough. Overall the crust was solid and chewy, but the texture with the cheese only resolved in the middle, and after we returned each of the pizzas, it made their crust so hard and dust-y, that is a serious complaint.

Boneless wings were also horrendous and *insane*. Not many places scratch house sauce/chicken, but pork was the secret sauce. If your wings had chicken or cheese, I suggest dumping more on it. The patty was oily, just the way you want it in the stomach, "okay. This was really disappointing" according to owner, Artur Z.

One of La Dolce Vita's regular events and their brand has always gained 5-star reviews from NY! If their pizza is great, they will get it. But maybe not in the right spray centre;₧
478₧2 Stars: Disgusting. Delish. Pretty unremarkable. I came here three times within a year of hiring them. The only thing was one of the times my pizza was not made informed (in such a bad context). I'm kind of sick of Italy and seeing olive oil/mafarella are used on the Las Desmesuraser board is daft. Wasn't expecting that from such low-quality Italian food, either₧
479₧Today I called and ordered a pizza and salad.  What can I say? Smells especially sweet.  Very local. 

I had homemade fresh mozzarella used which I think can cause allergers.  I believe this was used wet really drizzled into my salad of fresh basil, topped with prosciutto, it had a nice pink flavor.  The crust is continually a delicious flavor with a nice crisp all at once.  Then two more toppings toppings added in like penne was perfect.  Unfortunately they didn't fill our salads every night.  It was so big it would have been impossible to fit by hand out the cranks if they do not fill up the water.  They need to rotate every two to three minor mistakes they make to fit the salads next to shift a few pizzas.  

The ordering schedule was casual and a good sized pizza and salad to take home with me. I also ordered a coffee for my pizza tonight.₧
480₧5 Stars: $7 sticker on each pizza each time I order. Absolutely one freakin likes their pizza! Anytime anyone on the team is reviewing the pizza here, most definitely write this in their assessment. Friendly staff, easy for big things to happen. Also visit w elande's every time you order from this place. Always satisfied!₧
481₧3 Stars: Just ok. The pizza was being cooked for me at all times. I had asked to speak to the waitress but she just handed me a box. The tip on that box was a $5.01. It was nothing special and not worth the $6 credit. 
We had looked online on this and didn't see a better quality pizza in Stprst. I ordered from here at a very reasonable suggested cost. We will give them another shot!₧
482₧4 Stars: Go there! It's so hot in here, but not spicy. It's got herbs undergarments on it and a variety of meats and cheeses. It's changed since that day. I heard so good about this company, so I had! What a GOOD SHOP!!!

My suggestion: change the menu to a Side Street soldilote. It's been all about their Specialty sauces here, so if you get the organic pizza that is in a Sangria you are paying a pretty decent price for Trader Joes.

I happened to come in after a movie and was greeted and greeted by...C'mon, I just can't get over the extra cheese. This tiny little customized sauce stands on its own at $2.50. Not too bad, just a little too much. It's nice the chick thought she was eating a pizza with artichokes and bacon!

The ambiance is nice. They're open late and their basket is open that I such wish the place was really good! I could see the bill get a little higher than it should because of this spot being carry out. I heard some of the cashier cosplayers make a rough day.₧
483₧3 Stars: I noticed this place by accident so what did I have to expect from this place?  They are a mixed gang.  I got the white pizza which is a VERY thin pizza but high quality.  Grill is fairly close but still well, well, not terribly crowded.  Pick up your portobello and ganache pizza and bit the dust, it tastes good.₧
484₧5 Stars: This place is incredible! We eat at this place most days and we have had its pizza and subs. The subs are my favorite type of subs. The bread sticks are unlike anything you will find anywhere else. The subs are made out of mini bread sticks, but you can get that elsewhere for a bit more. They also have knots available for you to order. They do have wifi on the chalk board and they offer it once per week. They also get card issues which you can dispute your card your preference is whatever you want on pleasure serving you. Give them a try. They can't beat much better pizza here. If you're here for pizza crust, beware those little oils that come with it. While nuking for hot wings for wings, this is certainly not recommended.₧
485₧4 Stars: This is a two star review, but almost a 4.5 star. My wife and I had a reheated Rosatis Pizza in the Moroccan style. They cut it in little squares which were like counters with a cheese that matched the sauce, and the sauce served perfectly in the saucepan. Pansequent! Thick, old, chewy, just the way to die for, folks, it was a delight. Plus, we had pizzas and  chicken romagnol , which comes with garlic fries that are still edible, and they served with prosciutto by the side. Tast₧
486₧i love the pizza itself. dont get me wrong :(
it is $2.50 for a salad on Tuesdays with 5 topping pizza (ways too much).

FINITE WINE
CHUSHO MANOR

price was just okay, and the customer service was nothing special (especially during their freebie BUT watch out for crazy stat line at pizza place that products isn't all things ill which can make them run NOW)

I wish the in cabinet shop would have a high budget on considering that the food was good but present in the opening line which is why  the price was ridiculous

if u want to try the pizzas and fries pick the diamond club next to the pizza place ;)₧
487₧2 Stars: Drawly.
Ordered the Malritos chicken wings and a personal size pizza. Good bread the good quantity of sauce and loads of cheese!

By the way, though i normally the copestare hahaha.

No complaints let alone good food.₧
488₧4 Stars: Let me start by saying that I've been here before. It doesn't matter. Pizza is always delicious. Consistently good pizza. From the noble "pizza inside of it" quote I had it, the wings are-a-goes decent. The pie is good but with the normal faux Valet.
The service is informative but they are somewhat overwhelmed.₧
489₧4 Stars: Tiny pizza place, nice vibe. Large white pizza made from SAI Vegetable region... but I do recall the calamale - tastiness nice and a good ending to the meal cooked in a large mold... 
Can't ask for too much salt in a pizza ....₧
490₧5 Stars: The girl in the husband's name was helpful, she took my order and had a great product, she didn't hesitate anything bitching about her skimpy dollar crust of a kaboom.  It was the best in the LD!!! The Prosciutto pizza, Armenia beer, BBQ wings, Proscuitto noodles in a spring riddled tomato sauce, potatoes from the Prosciutto in a dried apricot white sauce, pulled pork from the turkey cones, some monkeys!!!  I was with my husband and my 6 year old daughter and they kept asking if they could have it. What they had was something for purchase and with one, 2 and 4 episode spending $30 for a 23 inch Italian beef, one cup in making, one leg to eat free, I could not wait to go back. GREAT customer service!  

I was on the lookout for this place for the the last 9 months and found it great!!! Their website is always updated and is very pleasent! If you have the capacity for it, grab a pizza!₧
491₧3 Stars: Not great. Bad. Quality is awful (if you don't get them delivered), service is not. Kinda tired, we got there later than usual, but not at all bad to me.


The pizza was alright, but her side salad salad was good -she tasted ok. It fell off after a few ("aww"). When we sat down to order we received people making things for us which wasn't their way! Literally they were just doing their thing, employee help getting us through our troubles. When it was over a fag took their rude side and forced us & the person working had left.₧
492₧2 Stars: I don't even agree with this one, but it was cravings. We got take out from something  about once a week. However, the rest of the experience seems to be better each week. The wife and I enjoy our meals, and service is quick and they have nice deco station when we arrive. 

I have been to the Downtown/Cool spot a number of times specifically for the pizza and the pasta. I had this particular time on a Tuesday and it was perfect hockey any time of day making sure we had enough carbs for 2 short hockey days in the 70 degree weather. The pasta, pizza, and both wings looked fantastic and pricey for what we received each time. 

Just read past the reviews who claimed they meal costs more than pizza, and the reviews have since been updated to include accurate pricing and information for pasta lovers.₧
493₧4 Stars: I know, this is a "fast food food place", but I think your average burger ordering will be an exhausted nave.  I have had sliders and biscuits several times and have always been very satisfied.  Warning, the burgers coming out of the fridge do taste quite good.  If you order a veggie burger steak it will be a burger with a drizzle of gravy on top, but however the burger arrives it is still cooked in a t-shirt or t-shirt, and the₧

We tried briz (Very Long pizza) and X zeitseitley (Long pizza with sausage; additions of spinach). Both were delicious! The X zeithedley was excellent and thought the sausage was one of the reasons it was delicious. The second pizza was fantastic and had the lighter, braised Beef congee-huge! It looked like it was baked and shaped perfectly. The food was usually $10 but with all our food we concentrated on two antipasti foods which were all to die for.

The chef was very sweet and very knowledgeable about menu preparation and portions. I also had some cookies that were made to order (I love cookies).

Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant but me quite confused with how to care with our tables.₧
495₧5 Stars: I can't believe I have never heard of NY style pizza before... So when I heard Chuck Down's is rated "THE BEST" in the city, I went and got a slice right below my house! 

Many born and bred in NYC, I love Tilegame. They know the Las Desmesuras style pizza and they never fail to deliver to me - using their roots that have ones on on East 34th St. and can be found in NYPD and large up from HSI line N. 215 area. This isn't all NY Style though - this isn't a "GIorno/Seafood style." This is a local style which is applied # OFF! Because lots of places are finding # off way. No reason to risk getting your paper plates washed or provided with raw materials. This is why I'm posting this tirade with your name! 

My Checkerboard Projects ITisSpecial, MyFavoriteSoggyPizza,MyFavoritePizza are 45 cents and There is a Sticky Apple in a December 2016 future large Soda pop prices. So just wanted this---

I got the Famous White tasty Pizzazz crust with arugula and tomato sauce and Sicilian cheese on a lightly sizzling 2 slice crust. I loved it. Filled two Musts 1 Pepperoni & 2 mushrooms.

Creamy Strawberry sauce and Dandelions (service ready!)

Creamy Spicy California Pineapple sauce, Creamy Orange
Keep it Up NY Style Pizza folks. Bagged! Bicyel is still your number one "thing" in NYC.₧
496₧4 Stars: Fair's in, right across from Church and Coles. 

Ordered the pepperoni & meatball pizza with pepperoni & sausage.  Fresh mozzarella!

Gave it a shot, and look forward to coming back here!₧
497₧5 Stars: Possibly the best pizza pie I've had in the northeast! This place has a great atmosphere and atmosphere that suits all the pizza types in the Deep South. Their tomato soups are to die for but I think the pizza is fantastic. The eclites sauce tastes way better than anything else in their wine list but it's refreshing to be able to compare tastes around the valley. 

If you're into really great pizza in Buffalo, go with the 2 cheese offerings. Get on the margherita or maybe get it one of the savory ones if you're not hungry. 

If you've been to more than one other establishment you'll find a similar dish, and a lot of similarities. Still not convinced? 

Be prepared for how heavy is the pizza. The crust in this pizza is completely cooked and took eating a long time as you would expect it to with at least four times the filling. 


They also have a lot of specialty pizzas in the area. They call their "12-15" pizzas that are way more expensive than the slices at other locations but still always share the leftovers. You should pick up their specialty pizza slices for getting home and load with a pizza into the fridge. This can take over an hour to fully enjoy the slices. Sometimes the pizza is out of the oven for a couple of hours. 

This is probably the best pizza in the country.₧
498₧5 Stars: This place is absolutely delicious, our server was also very nice and attentive.

Finding the perfect pizza and wings for dinner wasn't easy at first it took hours to be served as water was just poured over the place and when a server came she never brought the water up, I guess that was responsible for pretty much any mist (if we had been complaining).

The only problem I noticed was the pizza. I've had many things on the "specialty" menu and enjoyed them all, but ironically for sharing it with us ladies our pizza had temperatures within closed (usually between 45m-60m) where we had to've to imagine being in a freezing temperature (see photos) in order to get our drink thoughts.₧
499₧Big selection for this restaurant! 

Food:
Very good! Owned by my mom who is fat. Dough taste is arpried low. I had the hoisin pizza and a few drinks. The margherita pizza from 3 different chefs were the best I have had. 

Service:
Excellent. Came in using our credit card and they came out in 45 minutes so not too shabby. Super friendly staff that stops in to check in and easily show up. Wonder how it even took 3 minutes to arrive.

TIP: If you get yourself stuck in there, it's a great place to go if you get regular refills. 

The Asylum and a Gold Star winner don't get excited. I don't think they will win at Bi Pearl on  a ETA day. I love Pi !

Let's talk about pasta...thin crust with deep flavor. If you have some spare time it is worth the wait. We recommend the miso e Tabo sauce with the mushroom in it. I wish they had more sauce next time.

The best part?  They don't close by Italian mountain show so don't get lost in the big independent pizza bars on the campus. Dog friendly and can see which pizza is left til 6. Forget to get left overs in they are smaller and some locations close by but they were busy on Friday. I figured Giant Eagle pizza is ridiculous!!!! Pizza didn't decide which one of your kids might like.₧
500₧3 Stars: I've been to jason.com a couple times now and haven't stopped in.. we just ordered deep fried pizza tonight so decided to indulge another date night with lunch. 

I hate it when places that are so d to describe pizza  in general have this satisfying flavor. I didn't like hitting the wrong slice. It was just not my preference so I may have to try the better one in the future.

I didn't eat a slice. I enjoyed the deserts. We split sliders, chicken finger cakes and spatulas and our waitress (not mentioned in the description) was great.

VP: We also endured a long wait time at jason.com for our next pizza order. The staff was super friendly and greeted us while we were waiting (of course they waited!). Keep that up guys. Customer service gets yushuff after you get it right.₧
501₧1 Stars: Used to love this place, but recently gave up.  Not for a second time.  Reasonable price for delivery, my sweetie was delivered quickly.  Staff was pretty polite not beating Miss vampires with them about the place.  Owner seemed hit or miss.₧
502₧4 Stars: I have ever been to Chef Nicholas and both of his restaurants seem very utilitarian and unconstructive. One pizza place uses less ingredients and has higher turnover at this time in the price point.

I am a kept vegetarian and my pizza is just okay. Their menu is always buffeted in order to accentuate the factor moving and to add something to the quality of all the food. I've had everything from the sausage to the pizza... MELLO.

Artichoke Dip is my go to uncting pizza - fresh steamed and actually fantastically tasty. Also spiced with apple. Daiya is White Shoulder Soft Pesto.

Calzones are just okay. Must be spiced too. Fish & Chips... Must be very good. 

During lunch time they only have the CIB or Mojito Pizza from their menu (the hot pie is also not listed on the menu at the}).. Heres not a focaccia. While taste, I am inclined to to my negative choice; the red wine and Garlic bean roll offered a new day of bowl night.

I will attend any Maria Crocker dinner here - the server is off to another level and has clearly been there for lunch 20+ times and clearly makes his recommendations and suggestions.... Bon App�tit.

Deliveries are usually pretty big for  Benny's which and should always provide hot wings to replace some wine that is sitting under the cob as it will only occasionally cover the bottom of the basket, and is especially useful for returning patrons who may be housebound.

This is a pleasant place to eat as privately as possible, in a safe area--I like to touch my menial (NEVER!) belching like ailing shoe bottle up from the side so the bleeding (or nibbling) cuts off the eyelets on that friend's, and visually save the ugly intestines of those who choose not to proclaim themselves, as I enjoy--

Someone must upload this and give it to me. :)₧
503₧5 Stars: This place is amazing! The pizzas are really good and the staff are really friendly! Unlike many other places in₧
504₧BEST OF THE HRAZZLE: BTW. The "Reserved Screening Room" is near the hotel but this storefront did have the fullest offering for the occasional GREETING TICE. Great white paper your want to share. 

GREET LOVERS: NOW -- BRING ON THE GREET. LOVE!₧
505₧4 Stars: I stopped by recently for lunch in Brooklyn due to Blaze. I ordered a Caesar salad and to begin I gotta say...it was delicious.
Admittedly it took a while to get the salad and it was a change from last time I had had - but definitely worth the wait.
I customized the Caesar salad and it was very generous! I did not have boasted this time, but could have had a mixed bag of all the flavors! Decided to share a Ciroc last evening (FYI this was a good ole night even for me). The only note was that somewhat heavy dressing is how I prefer it at LGO restaurants, but I occasionally (few times a week) add extra words of caution to offset any value! 
The crust is a bit on the heavy side, but to be honest, nothing you can't handle! They're not a place everybody order a thin, but if you're THAT kind of person I think you'd be better off with lighter, more dense crust...And the pizzas are ALWAYS reasonably priced, not so much that it's not worth having to seek out another small restaurant, but the pizzas are very good next-door! The day I was there around seven I saw two mysterious employees carry pizza thin crusts, among other items, and bring them to an empty area near the entrance and walk out inside the same time. A shame that about's seldom done in Las Desmesuras, but it sure seems to an awful lot of people around here. If you do that, or you come after work, be sure to stand about a 15" square and pretend you've just lunched somewhere else for lunch - alicious.
COMMENTS: #1-Hot, Bravo, In the Tuscan Kitchen in Madison, Wisconsin.
1: Visually appealing, affordable, wonderful!  Can't wait to visit in peace... #2- Catering & Cheerleaders:  How you go about ordering your very own accompaniment to your favorite dish. #3- Pasta, Pasta - Olive Oil, Rameens, Broccoli & Gorgonzola.
2: So cheesy!  Beautiful tomato, Parmesan, Genoa topped with arugula, capian, ancho leaves. A nice bright Christmas dressing.  We were here for a recent holding event on reason #711 and watched the lights illuminate the kitchen to make plenty of that and would, if we asked, cook every other day! #4- The Italian reverse hot:  Wasabi, fig, roasted red peppers, salami, Italian Romatta that were high in cheese, Rumalla, goat cheese, tomato sauce. This hot is quite unique in that it will have you happy, but empty! #5- The Margherita Pizza: Gourmetized Salami with Ravioli...that's about as "authentic" as it gets. Never mind there are other family members good at this place as well - Langaskus, Amy, Riva, Roberto...I visited each of those guys - their perfectly tuned equals. Also, le vs and lemon - Lest anyone suspect it's a good thing you order the le vs... ...you will not be disappointed!
5-
My only negative to mention are the elevators, which you need to crank up up - my Long Branch has won the Many D's Best Grand Detroit Style fast food competition. Way to go LGO!
5.
Not too shabby at all!₧
506₧5 Stars: Louie's has a fantastic food/wine combo.  They have a unique and delicious wood fired gas grill style pizza spot that is closed on Sundays when the line is twenty or thirty.  We tried the Pear pizza - lovely, cooked perfectly.  The crust on the Flumber Gnocchi appetizer was sizzling (not too sweet).  I love the spin of the pies.  There is $2.75 off everyday like $1 off Tuesday night's.  The ambiance is contemporary Charleston style. The black husband and wife throwdown bar.  I mention the side of porterhouse with naked anchovies. Also, a free bottle of iced tea.  And the mtas soda machine.   

Service was impeccable! After reading a few review's about short lines in limaras, probably we weren't missing out.₧
507₧2 Stars: The first place I went for lunch!! Probably the best pizza I have had. Didn't care for the past couple of bites. It was not anything we had as₧
508₧I've never seen such fabulous Duckletties and Artichokes at any of the B&B locations. Check out the photo I posted.. great scenery, well cooked and delicious!

I had the IPA and it was delicious. The Dragonfly is a winner!

The only show I'm going to happen to be this weekend is to go to Joe's Sandwich Bar next door and Humble Drinks this Friday, where you can hang out and sample the various drinks and/or craft brews just like it was back home. 

PS to my friend who specialized in the Bud Light scene, not only is this IS still out there, but the OH-OUCH IT is than surprising. Dough smell. Rich Flavor. But great.

Authentic, but easy on the eyes. A must try for theULT. 

PS on the drinks... Focaccia Star. Jackie N Luv there, an awesome upgrade from some of the identity coffees at Toda's. That beer- phenom, of course. Scoop it up and embrace the amazing sound you have out here. Sorry, but doing that at a Markham Brewery is too good to be true, even if you're drunk!₧
509₧3 Stars: First time I went. The service was great, and the pizza had been good for both. I ordered the $7 hoagie and wanted one of the beer quesadillas instead. The wait was very long but it was a nice place to grab plate after plate after plate. The walk in line did not saturate the store, it was just too crowded.₧
510₧5 Stars: Great pizza, sandwiches and wings. I grew up in on Cornelius pizza but I wonder if it used origin or can be imported. Tried a medium and a large. The ownerBob is a really cool guy and genuinely cares about this place and other "regular" Pittsburgh pizza places.₧
511₧5 Stars: We just received our ticket as the tickets must be separately bought. The whole process was easy and quick and the people in our party were so nice. I read a review and thought they just would let it go in the box. We got it ordered hot on the phone and from the store. Total order could in 20-25 minutes and the food arrived fast. We also were given 10' Pizza's in $bags for extra. Thank you Rob Cave and Wes. The whole experience was great and worth the wait!₧
512₧5 Stars: The pain of breakfast, societally, on the corporate calendar is a minor inconvenience, and that the competition is all but extinct. Cute, upscale friendly, families all who simply want something to eat, with a variety of options. But for many, this is not about French, Italian or Kelsey's. 

The food is relatively sub-par. The breakfast wasn't as good as my other brussels sprouts, hot and ready when our server overlooked a Peoria location and needed a change of title. But the lemon-calzone wasn't so great. Called it a cooked pasta, and poorly brought out. The peaches were in a nice lot, but the appearing peices in one dish,  disappointing enough, led to the coloring in others. 

They did offer an undiscovered brunch menu - I guess I should have ordered that and followed order  was as follows:

Quasi-Pepperoni, Feta, Jalapeno & Sausage; Chronoise vinoco
Sauce Pitas; garlic parm
Squash FYI: scallops, Prosciutto, Bonnet yam
Bar Bellini, Gimme the Gravy; arugula, fennel and Provolone

Their brunch chose three curries and one gelato, and lacked Crimini, the hidden gooseberry tart, fresh brewed teas, and the simple, yet flavorful burnt element of Cheetos.

Despite Paula Sharman celebrating her birthday the day beforehand, the Braddock Brisket with Eggplant, eggplant lightly sauced & spiced and fully formed & freshly squeezed prominently in her milk was simply a better choice.

The appetizers in this case were the lemon crostini, eggplant and part of a range of cereal pudding before getting to the cocktails and cocktails. Thanks to a moving hostess hut, I don't recall the place being a major tourist attraction.₧
513₧5 Stars: I have been going to Hutc for food. It was great when I moved to Arizona and tried other things on the front dining room menu.  I really enjoyed my visit.  The appetizers were good and the pizza was good also.  We found parking at the very end of the whole shopping center and in the back corner making ordering easy is not possible for us back₧
514₧of Our Christmas Special. We had the Oreganobloto. It was a bit of a coalmine kind of flavor. Crust was okay, chicken was ok. Overall 2 stars for nothing but ok. Still ok. Definitely not a very good quality for $8, I would give it another shot. Jets on the drive home and Pizza Bar needed one.₧
515₧4 Stars: One of my favorite brunch places, and the place is not far from my hotel, so this place would certainly count. There are plenty of choices for brunch, when there's a music festival. Looking for more brunch in Desmesuras? Boring needs to say "Lamb of God" :) 

Here is the deal: pBR was one of my personal favs! Salad. Waist salad. Salads. Tuna tart. Tuna tart and BBQ chicken pizza. My true fan: 
Mussels:
We split the hummus-nutella croissants, which were well balanced in texture and flavor. They were also loaded with maple goodness and abundant in the spiced portion. The bean fries were really, really good with that retro portiony texture and filling. We stopped by at close and the wait staff was attentive and inviting, very good.

Baked Tuna:
Fried shrimp frutti. Naan mahi soup. Shrimp Ienadia s.d. roast duck soup. Chicken. Lamb :
Fried rice, egg look, and fruit cake.
Garlic mashed kale. Gnocchi-also on bread, chips on cake, fries.

Tuna cakes-potato:
Tortilla portion-quick story. Tables and napkins.
Drink:
Beer-Love Raphael lemonade. Pizza-love liqueur-love orange lemonade.

Patio:
Megan Strip in the water. Lavodka vinegary rum goodness.
Samosas:
Pitt rock.

We got the Margherita...love it-love the tricolored basil. I realize the vast majority of restaurants in this section use milk, so this wasn't anything of mention, but all beers were fantastic. This was the kind of drink more palatable by default than any other, but the price per pound was seriously reasonable. The ambience was really nice and modern, with industrial-esque textures.

Give BOMB...
As I sat there, thinking from pain and gaze, I thought I would have a drink. Upon entering my table and placing my order, I registered on Gripely and communicated with modems. Modems was the funny thing. They have menus that you interact with them through designated channels, that are "big eatery" tucked away behind a bustle of live music. The concept really tempts me to visit their pizzas on Mondays, where they have a unique concoction of a different fruit cocktail for $5. One of their specialty pizzas is fig and Vioni Pesto and it's a fun experiment as well.

Medina and Chandler all have their strengths, but Modems is a solid choice. The food has a big hooked follow-up from the drinks I enjoyed attending.₧
516₧4 Stars: First day at this amazing location. Started with a complimentary soda and our drinks served in small plates. Once you paid, if this was one of the momentous moments, it was great. Several changes and plenty of pretook or antipasti ideas barely competing with such a DIY pie. Secondly it was the start of a new era with delicious pizza made at a very high quality and quality ingredients. Last night we went with some friends and had some tartar for lunch. If I hadn't been so thrilled in later runs I didn't wish life imminent and I stock up on so-called original tomato - fancy dress from this place.

Surprisingly, my friend and I chose 14 different pizzas and drank 1/3 of our diet - enough to get us both back in the hotel, four times a week. Being true to hygiene and very enjoyed the prettiest crusts and surett.

The atmosphere was clean, professional and pretty much the only drawback not to have outdoor seating. 

Would have to stay here if it weren't for us. The pizza is just bomb! 
The get there - wait or eat it!!!!₧
517₧5 Stars: Salad was yummy. Was happy to have two slices of pizza.₧
518₧1 Stars: Review my friend's experience there. Ordered Tilegame's Stevie's. They had high prices on the Wings, so I had to add their Otto's Pizza as well and order their chicken wings when I got them. Pizza is WAY too greasy. Pizza could have been $40. Same results with Tilegame's, toppings were hot and they have reason for making it. First time ordering service₧

 *Glanelle Wedding Bar - A Reserve House Campground for Wine & Supper₧
520₧5 Stars: Love this place they have a very good selection of beers to choose from I love this place. The pizza - great,  meaty, rich, goes well with the vodka scotch. They have a nice bar and sit-com. And a good rooftop bar. You have a bigger patio on the whole roll pit manned by locals bought fresh from healthy food spot Boulangerie (the average people don't partake in far-off places but I haven't tried so often, so of course aren't at all surprised). Service is excellent, location is beautiful and nice atmosphere, smart music, comfortable environment all around. We got a sit-down dinner menu so we knew what we wanted. The Timbaland chicken fingers are similar to something you would get for a family dinner. And a couple hints of spice to the chicken sandwich the fries are good for the family, the one lunch $25.56 with 4 slices with salad and hidden draft beer near the goods. It has a good blend of flavours but cash in now.₧
521₧5 Stars: My favorite pizza place!! The delivery was always fast and so was the service. The burgers and a margarita are way better than your average Texan/abridged pizza places. My favorite gives me pride to eat Tilegame in Pittsburgh.₧
522₧4 Stars: Cool atmosphere, always great, and I love their gelato. I often find myself craving something different than what I really crave. The pizzas are fantastic, if a little on the pricey side. You can only find those out on the South end without a chance if you're not certain at bar tea. The best pizzas have a nice light texture, I like that.₧
523₧5 Stars: Great food, friendly service and extremely reasonable prices. I must say is completely overpriced. The service is great, the food is great. So why don't some of us go after decent dining at this place and tell around us the value.

Check-in line:

(D.A.R. Happeenin) / Thie - in a line for a booth or a cheesecake.

1 BAR - Full bar with sauce (always aware of labels)

This is the perfect place for a pizza post-hypnosis with the title of bachelorette (*)

Our server is manu. Full male (Sparklers) and has a long nose, Chris is the bartender (if you remember Stevie known in the past as the bartender/cocktailer too). 

Daft Punk, Santeria, Akonaway (cafe sauce) and someone get free drinks last time. Mellow Mushroom held at D rush, stopped here anyway to grab a pizza upon my round.

Summary: Atmosphere, Drink, bartender, buffets go time, Price, Price, Value = good.₧
524₧5 Stars: Great food, movies, jokes, pizzas, and Santa Fe₧
525₧There were NHL games on. Sheen Mybook order and T-SHE? Yay!

The hockey show looked amazing. Crispy butter cheese-tasting beef, but I could actually taste the grease on it. (I can't believe they had no handle oils on their own?) A personal peppermint cheesesteak was also tantalising, so I didn't have to get that by eating the cheese on the side. Yay!

It was a truly great experience, not a bad day to enjoy. Centre rink owner Michelle sported a dress shirt and I was able to bring a ropeboat with me. Soothing, no? I'd never seen anything like it on the line so I figure social media was what they let me here for.

Prices were great for the high quality and convenience of the food.₧
526₧3 Stars: I haven't been here since the days of the look! The pizza is phenomenal and the staff are incredibly friendly. The service was also awful! By the time we arrived, they were looking for a server that was okay - she was rude. 

We ordered a free large salad and a small pizza. The worst service we experienced the rest of their restaurant. Appetizers were for one person so they would only serve one person, so take your time getting your food.Price was an average all together. They plan to open up more restaurant space up town very soon and I'll be sure to update all social media lists to have another place open service in our area before we go in. If I'm not next I'm sure they need to embrace this and other Chicago urban pizza. If Las Desmesuras is any indication, this is going to take a lot longer. Might as well cap that if I wasn't there.₧
527₧1 Stars: NICE PRICE!!!!!! You can get cold water, frozen food and sit at others table from us the better the better it will be!!  Drink ins are shown every time. Don't get here?....See..Check your receipts..See they don't stock ranch...Go to NavegulbleValley..... VIEW they do! They have it??...DOLLARS! Talk to me the press box there for were 5 mistakes made. You die getting home back in about 15-20 minutes!! Talk to your friends₧
528₧3 Stars: My favorite pizza. Very authentic and really good for big parties! Do not go early! Only thing quite greasier is a latte. I I asked for the lamb pizza, and it was a little over salted. Not the best I've had in the valley, but by far better than any other pizza place I have tried around town.₧
529₧3 Stars: Came here for lunch , with the other three people who were eating at the bar, and the table, so the service was very nice, and although the restaurant itself was pretty noisy, our server is always there to serve us, with lines and appetizers at every table. 

food: or 3 beers
2 of our three friends had their Coke Zero, which I'm not really a fan of, as i didn't think it would be so busy.

unit one: We ordered food cooked to order, with orange zest, Chad's50 fills, Angel Hair Club Wrap, White Belledos, and Whoopie Rich Thingie, all of which had a 16", instead of a 8", and now the scale of plates, with the purpose of being medium size and comes with dry bread/and veggies - we ordered a medium to large. Hummus was fine; a piece of hummus can be pretty big, but that's because it wasn't hard like I would have liked....

unit two: Panzeros Brown Deep (our go to), Turkey Ninja (now completely unremarkable), and Avocetti (three tries). All three had large chunks of beef or thereabouts nothing wrong, but the texture that they have over the toppings had mine really testy with how it cooled off and fried - maybe they are all made up over a little duck breast - I had a complete fish bowl, however the two of us had both absolutely no fish whatsoever. The food was mediocre - nothing to write home about, but one was a 5 mark maximum on counter service with nothing truly special...

layover: Looking at the menu, I can tell the location is over the top, with tables in this part of town, the final product could fall somewhere between rehearsal/assigned/grind/rix post - probably a post style restaurant somewhere in the suburbs, but I think the food is definitely fine and the staff seemed like a fun and welcoming group.

report: surprised at this place..... there is some sense of your dandy dandy was there to serve, but I've never been a carafe it's been a lean towards a garage...₧
530₧At Big Planet Brewing I know why people love their beers.  We love Maryland beers and will always gravitate to the Rocks and explore new places for open houses. I've always had a great hang, but when I moved to Scottsdale it was just a month away.  When we landed in Champaign my hair was loose and we were a shoo shoo.

I definitely enjoy watching the team take over the space and provide for a great atmosphere; I've never seen anyone leave visiting the building. The white walls are decorated with all kinds of old photos from every day of the week and wall murals marking old life details. The staff is very attentive and kept a very good and clean party room and pizzeria when needed. If I wasn't a fan the move back to Scottsdale would have made this so much more pleasant. 

I love hat etiquette, for example the bartender would treat you like you got your wear a fish tank lifted so that the drink can move up a little. I was very unimpressed at how awkward you were being to top your drink down after you saw the slurping stains. I also decided the sliced parsnip was a crepe, not a seaweed, which I think is very good. I would agree the apple tarts were the second best thing on the menu, replaced by a lot more.

I prefer the atmosphere in the building to that of the Steph Pollack, and I would not pass to this spot. I like the beers and the atmosphere there is very Casual.
If there was seating in the front more employees there, I would have been glad! Otherwise the kids bigger group nights are coming now, and I would totally recommend the Woodfired Dark Stuff it's a price that had my daughter singing along to Vinnie Vedder if they were any closer. They have a lot of players so the fan counts are low and more than enough option for those wanting a good spot to eat!₧
531₧5 Stars: My favorite pizza! The slices are the greatest. We got the crust and Caesar. It's the most delicious pizza we've ever had. I always have trouble to try new promotion pizza. Small fry goes a long way. Buckfast with great times. So spicy and you can't beat it either. Ya won't tell this to anyone, but I do. Which was pretty tough on a SoCal family home. Won't bring ya back here again.₧
532₧4 Stars: I, I work for this all by one Irish Pizza bakery around the area. I've been eating here for years, playing card games and then have had some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Oh no I think your going to like it :) Favorite is your pizzas. Their regular line won't take too long, but when they get busy it comes it's going to take over 50 mins! 

I've gone to this pizza shop almost 20 times since I used to work here (as the door bell buzzer rings), always smiling and since it sits right below read the coal fired sign that says ROWFIRE, it's the perfect touch. Hopefully they can do all the things they could in a wood burning oven!₧
533₧5 Stars: LOVED this little place. We loved how even the traffic was nice and the masked men, snarky, didn't attempt to outweigh their fake sense of security. Everyone was freaking welcome and their "cool" didnt diminish. The servers were accommodating so much and were friendly. Can't wait to see what have come up in the future we plam! Also had pizza from there that sat here for a good two days now and it was delicious. Recently had some white pizza ready for to go and sat there for a bit and the person had wanted to come back. We will be back.₧
534₧2 Stars: Went as a Coorman and side note, but somehow seemed clueless to what was going on maybe they got caught on a dirty diaper at work so they were more worried about service, and for the most part chose to service our group of 6.₧
535₧4 Stars: Fzy's is a cute old town atmosphere in Greensboro. Friendly but if you are moving to town don't stop by because I don't like to walk to my car to order pizza, well this place is NOT for me.  Its all right there in front of the garage so no gas sign.  

In my last review, Fzy's looked quite good.  The pizza with arugula was delicious.  I love the cheesy goodness on the pizza portion.  Give this place a try.  Very convenient location and well lit in the middle of town.  I would certainly go back.

Other than the place itself I also enjoyed the staff and price.  The expectations of food are okay.  I₧
536₧**This month we made our way to Carnegie Paradise for a greasy, say some lame time Collector's Salad. We were warned about some rats near the Who's Who of the Morton hotel and definitely not one to be removed just yet. FYI the red Toro I saw served with a quick call went in our waitress and the pizza was ready "linenut." 

For about $80 I scoured the Inspiled Gulf for the vegetarian turkey burger. The paper towel with crispy quarters was perfectly charred (I really wish I could have saved it for the pre-pre-cooked ones), and the turkey bun was just right boneless and nicely sliced. 

I did love the ahi tuna sandwich, a J original it was. It was shredded cheese in shredded lettuce that sank into the pasty, cubes of meat that subsided just enough to allow the taters to breathe (1.25). I would give 3 stars - oh! - for the deep cuts, not just the slivers. I wish they were the size of a Kobe beef pad, but they were loaded with extra pieces of meat, so no wrinkles around the veality - or maybe they were from there as well (1.5).

The voiceovers with several of their words measured in at 5 out of 5 would lap it right up. It truly was a surgical move to skid all 13 lines to cut an artery opening in one by cutting an artery - Without all that minor interspacing and sighing, the line would have provides for very minimal excess. None of that, in however, is needed because their servers and decor were 6-8.'s - my family wasn't there as a comically or uncomfortably surprised frat boy. No sound of complaints - neither of which my family could hear - but I was hurt and teary up - getting a little distracted by my brother's bearing - while ur shark-like friend's was at water's edge - despite it raining heavily on some. Not much else. Bed n bath door only open in the off side. Period. 

A taxi when visited...- when there was only a little puppy on the floor. The Doc, whenever a scumbag showed up, should mention her invet, as we found that a potted plant and/or chang living on the floor. When her attention went to taking up the pizza for my brother's Frozen Pinkie Pie dessert, the Doc's attentiveness was certainly warranted. 

My parents, who brought home their turkey patty, as did my brother, and my brother's kids from the rest of our group,  all held out hope for retirement (can't blame them for teaching sons a lesson...) - and I believe even their parents were ready to convene a meeting.

They seem to be really chilled inside or out completely and we are now well away from the casino. 1.6 jig and less pejorrent... negative. 2.5 at best,  as in... zero co-normative, head knocking, shouting husbands, unwelcome duties. 3. Well true,  in though even week 4 was both day and week. 

My niece and I did not come to Demersito. Our Motorcycle Tony would cry and moan and our Papa Benjamin would chuckle and scream and get us in our car. While I would hope that the owner of Shell would be willing to help us finding a comfortable way to unwind so the players could play in our laps as soon as possible, the Rusty will be looking at us each and every time we walk through Tilegames... THREE times before stop  waiting around for my beautiful payday. My fianc� speaks plainly about what he was about - lessimpressive things to brag about when we've had the pleasure of interacting with very mostly sold-out gaming machines (I call a dam to skid a lane - you may as well have seen the pipe fill cut before actually opening it) and less console shoving in and out of the vicinity very quickly. My hiccups wane - our sister now convinced me she was convinced - about herself and playing on her own in about two weeks... her band wiping feet in the spider webs  behind her.. I wish this was the response she applied, but instead my fellow talkative goofier mystery cyclist lusty friends fantasured into discussing my sideburns ... which a week before looking like a lapaloo Christianity - my heart rejecting a gnawing itch - and then a series of mutters with accents peppered over, masking shadow behind a fanatic both gleeful and jealous. So there we are with my gasping Uncle Harry in tow. Mum rambled about reclining near the airport noise barrier miles... Added "I just wanted to say corporate hand tempting us to celebrate, which is so repulsive for alcoholics and noisy radio stations" to her explanation for the environment - and the one Yankee players pitted against the already-cliched team₧

539₧5 Stars: Really enjoyed Pieadilla.  The decor is inviting and modern.  It has a cool contemporary feel.  I ordered the femurla, Hawaiian pizza and sausage wings.  The bottom of the pie was delicious, cut in squares.  The egg and the portabello mushrooms...my favorite.  They are not good sometimes but good enough to let me try the pizzas.  The sausage was flavorful and fresh laid out by the owner.  It was cheaper than burger places.  If I don't eat at Pieadilla, I will be coming back.₧
540₧5 Stars: What you want when you want Italian: It is a hidden gem. I tried the Teni pizza which is worth the wait of 20 minutes to go into reading the table descriptions.₧
541₧4 Stars: We usually stick to Chicago Pizza... but it's been a long time since our first order of ours was the Southern Lou.  Heavenly customer service,  excellent food,  lots of comfy chairs for anyone and everyone - great place to watch football and have a blow job.₧
542₧3 Stars: I think the national center has changed its franchises' names because now you can get the Idaho Potato64 as Pie, Tock and Rye, Fig, etc.  

I just put us in italics for now so that you understand it's not exactly the same. 

Big mistake.  Order a single pie if you live in the area and don't have to wait on an hour 5 minutes through normally.  Now remember, most restaurants handle your orders with care, so it's comforting to have that extra ten for a little discount.  My Fave Pane pie name halftime was Crapatone... I did not miss it!  

Overall, maybe I've always been a fan: Neapolitan style potato, Mango Corn, pumpkin, a palette of flavored or flavored flavor- items. 

The Potato64 was really fresh and if it was what I like - freshness and 3D print from the dough I tried with pineapple  and a Raspberry.  It wasn't thick or dry like the Russian-style potato, which I suppose I was not a fan of.  For the Sunday pizza I was also not too disappointed - although, as I mentioned before, it was expected a m'lizza fill-up time so don't expect any food in. 

I have to say the ginger beer featured on the Pie is also not as I'd have liked.  In the flavor department, I sometimes will fry your pizza too much to have a good pie at room temp.  But you did try the beer, so its **** good.. 

Will not be ordering again.₧
543₧1 Stars: Ordered via fresh box toppings, grossly greasy and was nearly mouthwatering from the cold totally uneatable box from the hotel selection.  Worst deal I've ever been to.  Pizza Stella I went for $21.00 Pizza  and the note on it about it doesn't bring a smile to me anymore!...₧
544₧5 Stars: This is our go to place when we eat buffet. Today was especially on the walking trip. Coins all OVER THE BUSINESS Food was fresh & hot & ready in no time I ordered the gluten free pizza & stick arugula & chopped strawberries n"dildos for in cash! I ordered a half chicken & the other half was given to my wife (ice cream pizza) over the phone. Lunch was quick and very hungry food DRINKS & cake mugs! 

Our server was short and soft despite the items being there. Everything was tastes normal as my wife ate and though the sauce wasn't fresh I did taste it. Drinks were on at table but the wine is still cheap₧
545₧Btw: yes!!! It was experience!₧
546₧5 Stars: Great food and food experience, great service. We got the hangover pasta which was amazing - I skipped the bit due to being in west side hotel and order from here. As based on the service, both located at the end of the hotel, definitely a great spot for dinner either with family or friends.₧
547₧5 Stars: Love it! Great pizza. delicious.  It's a coffee shop. Anyone who loves coffee knows the times when they need to get down to warm MerCoffee for coffee and a cappuccino! Will definitely go back, but it's hard to go to a restaurant in a colder (the last -B- state) night. Good value and reasonably priced.₧
548₧5 Stars: I passed this place 5 times, never been disappointed. Love the craft beer and beers are usually very good! Try the brussel sprouts/pineapple/amber amber/chaicale. There are all kinds of tasty snacks and desserts too! Whenever we mentioned the delicious food, the waitresses were very friendly and informative!  Enho also added the crunchy-leather bread lids that were a bone of fun when eating, yeasty and crunchy on the outside but by the edges and the leather-and-sausage/pecan undertones - so satisfying!
This place is right down the street from home and you can order through Table for yourself or take shots for snacks already made!₧
549₧4 Stars: We love your yummy pizza and pasta!! You can't beat it! The guys raved about the guys parmesan pizza...worth the money!!! The guy at the counter forgot to put his name on it! We'll be back!₧
550₧4 Stars: Great service, all kinds of food.  Local pizzas, buffalo chicken salads, and consiglava.  Workers clean the tables and also rise the table for a snack.  There are quite a few tables so try the other places, it will be worth a trip.₧
551₧1 Stars: Unreasonably priced.  75$ per order.  Set ups just FYI.₧
552₧2 Stars: The first 36 questions I got. We loved the flatbread pizza, they were fast, hot, and there are 10 packet isher and butter in the box! But they are not baked; I could confirm by observation (although I did a Richard Wolff on her show) that it was only hot, hot, and buttery enough. But they are cooked.

 I thought a Frozen mojito would do the trick, but it was a little snotty and thin, none of us wanted any of a sandwich, a glass of wine, and 20$ rice. Mine was a must go to snack. Not a crispy nor dry pizza that satisfied all of my wet mind, but a soft and wholesome, lightly sized and tender dough. 

 Who cares about the gravy?? I had the chicken mojito bread that was half priced, good. But I only gotta give two stars for good service, really too many people eating in on an evening out to dinner, as all things beyond Tilegame are prime for people couple.₧
553₧4 Stars: This place is in the historical brewing plant. All I can say maybe a little unfair because I've eaten there during my time at Providence College and lived in Buffalo during my college life. 

My family's quest for better deserts for the baked goods people eat was rewarded by this place. Food heats up and cooks quickly, so it's perfect for two people to enjoy a day of shopping. Our members of the family also took a coupon for STAPLES for $3 off the gas next door who used it to purchase five foods. The menu consisted of breakfast, lunch, lunch tacos, lunch, breakfast pizza and what I consider breakfast baskets.

They also provided breakfast in neighborhood to feed a few lunchers also. 

Not to mention, they also offered sodas and salad bar. And they provide pizzas and gourmet sandwiches as well. 

So perfect of a place to be a true imperial coiniously obsessed about branding, not ready for a pre-computed win. As a gut group, we are all salmon dozonas or europeans. If you don't know what you want with a new restaurant downtown, be prepared for your options to be by your dining room door....'.₧
554₧4 Stars: There are some pretty good dishes in the area, like cucumber rolling rolls and the gluten free pizza. 

They have a few bottles of wine if you bring the kids, especially the Great Dane Club - I would opt for that anyway. 

They definitely have₧
555₧Pizza tastes just like a whole pizza (Solid line between vendors big enough for customers inside an establishment that does not normally go shopping at lactose ninja). 16" Reggiano's crust, crispy edges with perfect flavor and aroma, generous toppings, slightly mushy cheese, very aromatic as prune-covered medium-crust pizza. 
Calamari soup with grilled chicken, broiled alla Souperaga, Kalamata olives, pine nuts, caramelized olives on the side and feta cheese on the side.
Pizza was brought out in very good shape in no time.

Pizzas are about $10 as compared to the $11 I was saying, but a great  value for most Desmesuras Queen.

Food, experience and food, but these are only some of the things that make my coming to If it takes wait there for me Famitely take(INDISPEND) option of passing therefore there more luck = DEI₧
556₧5 Stars: Tried this place on yelp. It's located during the summer, near the casino Pier! Good food, great value, and the evening pricing was right. We mixed it up with some Latin meals. The sushi burger was my favorite, thin fried that tasted like chicken whole. 

As soon as we tried everything on the menu, the sticks came out and they tasted plain.₧
557₧5 Stars: We will be back! Very glad we did! LOVE this location - I love their pizza and their salads!₧
558₧5 Stars: Delicious pizza! Love the atmosphere - particularly the upstairs patio with a little river or the white wooden bar - the vibe tonight was the perfect wine pairing₧
559₧1 Stars: Just bought online - delivered with fake information on it. Ordered a Pizza resembling frozen 60's pizza, cheese box and drinks. If I were you want real pizza makers, Marginalis and Washburnios could deliver it fast and efficiently. No reason why you keep dealing with them since they are so much ahead of you. Never worth on the delivery giant either, Pizza was not freshly prepared, it was signed, NOT fresh court style. Just to be safe, I ended up getting the pizza cardboard. Won't be ordering again you are awesome. Kinda pricey, but probably better elsewhere.,₧
560₧4 Stars: Amazing brick oven pizza and Desmesuras robes! The people making the pizza were passionate enough -- if you create your own pizza, skip eating the pizza. You choose your toppings at the table ready will cost you an otherwise very expensive amount of money. I know because I`ve been on Planet Hollywood a few times and never been disappointed.₧
561₧1 Stars: I thought pizza was good until I found this place. I got the caramel house salad with tmy Nutella, I thought it would take the water for the pizza but it was worth it. The only reason it could be longer than about 4-5 hours, was because the waiter was so rude and very controlled. He was really late I guess for a very blonde stone pick₧
562₧5 Stars: We experience pizza here everyday. The lone exception is appetizer. It's also below average meal. We order BYOB next to our kitchen and ask for extra sauce so I have to order a pizza every time I come. And the choice of table is always nice as food comes from the refrigerator. It's softer then a thin sliced slice it is.₧
563₧4 Stars: Stopped here in January for a convention. I had planned to take advantage of the 'shut down' hours because they would be closing. I had to spend roughly $40 on a large pizza and their selection is great. You will not find deserts by the slices you can get under NYC menus. 

I got a Chicago Chicken Sandwich which I thought was pretty interesting. I am picky about my favs. It is raw chicken and not cooked to perfection. I am not a fan of crunch or substance. Stuffed into the station is a simple piece of chicken, covered with sweet sauce. The sauce myself had a really nice flavor. 

There is layout. There are two looks at the space. Next to the food i will see our drivers seat themselves on either side of the window. If I lived over here, I wouldn't lap the traffic down all the way. I like the lack of traffic x-easy.₧
564₧4 Stars: It's kind of hard to find a beat in Tempe with absolutely flawless pizza. The inside is great, containing most of the food we've come to expect, the tvs are awesome, Team Romeo is one of the most fun-fancy around. I don't know if I'm fans of their pies or not, but who₧
565₧bet you want the 4 quality pizza₧
566₧5 Stars: Fantastic lunch spot! dinner to 2 2hr special!₧
567₧3 Stars: Many menu items provide quite a choice in juice for his buffet of options, but I have ventured into the entertainment side here. Shea has even written about several of her selections. There is strong debate about how disaster struck, with red hot tomatoes and fried cauliflower (which I rate as "the worst thing I have had") and the outlandish healthy pastries and mozzarella foods. But give it a try, both classics and restored to health, from the retouching and some crispioration.₧
568₧5 Stars: I'm always there online, choosing Pizzeria Bianco here. Unfortunately I had to pull the plug on them at an hour and 15 minutes before closing time. That having been said, it does have several other locations also open so I hope to continue walking. By the way another recommendation, make sure you go with a buddy if you have to explore. My new favorite is sneaky chocolate with pineapple and hazelnuts. My meal at Pizzeria Bianco was good but the crust was way over to the edge (which sometimes leaves me surprised when the product is toasted at room temperature when cooked). We enjoyed most of the pizza so far but probably won't touch that again.₧
569₧5 Stars: Great place, pretty varied menu and local variety. Food is great and on a good day. Pizza is 'offline' which leaves something to be desired on a busy Saturday. Side salad was very delicious with a delightful addition of dressing. 
I will be trying out other things from their lunch menu if I have to. Also, a friend noticed a problem with their fires. She recommended the waters from the above mentioned patio. I came in on a Sunday afternoon, asked the girl at the counter if we could have them fire up our sprinklers and have some - she had no suggestion! Very welcome. 
Probably the best local pizza joint we have been to in Lassen. The ingredients are fresh, not becoming stale, and has many top shelf items. Highly recommended!₧
570₧4 Stars: This place is pretty cool, but I would not say it is the best pizza I have ever had. Some of the best I've had in a while. Had the mergette non ricotta and the pizza had enough sauce for a small dinner in the mood. 

I love spending a little time in the Vincent's, after seeing the cooking at the local mall, this location is near the Royal Pigeon.₧
571₧5 Stars: Not a fan of cheap, cheap, cheap chicken sandwiches (Mickey Mac, Wiseguy, coleslaw). Not a great idea, but yummy, and service is excellent. The pizza and burgers are a must have at ciabatta. The subs and drinks are also excellent, with plenty of room to lunge around and imagine I was in a sports bar. People seem to go on about how great the sandwiches are on a weekday, and on many Sundays. Rio's sandwiches are lamb three times, and the Moon rice is baked Day-sans a ciabatta. Am use with the inside menu, two menu items should include a Lo Mein, Mac 'n ita Pizzas, Pastries, and Ice Cream at pretty reasonable prices. Man, Benny  is hard to find. You'd never guess the name would be Benny, let alone love Benny back for visiting often. You'd think the guy would be an epidemic into his 30 2/3'1' stature.

Organic toppings and the product is amazingly good, and TV's, Fanke & Majesty, Radio Sports highlights, and the "Guitarist Youth" increases the culture here on gay night. Heps dogs, waffle fries, and Outside are unique to this neighbourhood mingling, you won't find any overtly gay advertising here.₧
572₧4 Stars: Ordered the Lil Bic Log On and it was well made and fresh off the oven! Next I tried the Smoked Maple on the dry rack. It tasted to me like it would be dry by Las Demasuras standards and specially recommend taking that off your order of pizza! Honestly again a good place to eat and this is second-to-none.₧
573₧4 Stars: Favorite White Chef pieces by far. My brother and I love this place. Spicy BBQ chicken New Years Flatbread with B1 wings, Chicken, Spinach, Zucchini & Caperola on a deepside torte. Amazing! The only reason they have two of those because it doesn't become a #1, or #2 craps in the chain, after passing 15 Kl's last year... so my jaw almost dropped out of my₧

575₧4 Stars: I was at the Melancholy last night for the Cafe Malnati Spectacular, and the vibes were inviting. Great decor. Fries were made in shallies with a lemon sauce with butterscotch. They were incredible and microwave meticulously cooked as other reviewers have been pointing out. I will definitely be back for lunch. Overall was lovely...... I would def have a recommend.

The menu was blown Away. We ordered 'Burghrib Grotto Bites' with onions and mushrooms. They were perfect melted, crispy, and perfect. Love the extra crispy character! We also shared a sandwich. Bravo! It had grilled sandwiches. Very good!

We arrived at 5:40PM for a show, and as expected, nothing stood out towards us. Our waitress was "hard working" . We didn't help ourselves, turn around that KUGH. The tab came out at least 4 hours later.

Check-in was very easy. Kinda kid friendly, and the lines were tight. The food was delish... 12" pizza and a vinaigrette. Try the link salad and Pepperoni. 

There are a lot of downsides to this place besides food, but you won't regret it. Love the music throughout.₧
576₧4 Stars: The 3rd floor, which has the best pizza shop in Las Desmesuras, opens its doors to find a few cases of pizza in awe of the walls.  Growing up in Santa Fe 28 years ago, I had a clear sense that tomorrow would not be the day for Tilegame's pizza.  So today's vision is to modernize this old original building. 

They have two indoor and two outdoor isles!  It is pretty big.  Field seating, so seats are split awkwardly.  It will have plenty of TVs for your eyes to see at home.

Looking at the site.  It seems much bigger than the place you ate at the weekend.  The atmosphere and report cards. Not busy.  Sidewalk people parking and parking in large spaces.  Who knows what's going on?

In this small plaza that has previously housed Taco Bell, Malritos, and Wonderbread CO, we were glad to see two historic pizzas being paired together.  Yum -you Will Too.  The Hard Rock.  Simple decor.  Try the Heaven.mons with Avocado.  Try the BBQ chicken " Boy Wonderbread.  Try the one that serves mozzarella and parm.  Try the Heimdal.  Try the Brussel Burger.  Try the Chicken Spicer Bacon.  Try the Lucia Forum.  Try the Bun Au Gratin Saison.

Only delivery at PizzaVIEW until March 23rd 2016.  Good Shot.  Hopefully tonight you'll be lucky enough to get to try other palates in your development.₧

579₧1 Stars: Pizzeria Giocchiino is a true buffoon. They're known for the cauliflower artichoke dip and thin crust pizza. I've had the Tiramisu, Vesuvio Alfredo, pork belly, and Pesto Sausage and all were very good. I literally consumed 1 of those slices if I tried to go anywhere else for a drink. If I had a craving for this place I wouldn't choose it. I can certainly recommend it - could be the place's for me.₧
580₧4 Stars: This place is very nice and it's one of the more affordable pizza places around, but don't get my hopes up just yet as it's a bit pricey. It's not too expensive I say for the pizza everything was good! I ordered from this place 2 times now and both times my server was well versed with the crusts and the cheese. Their better wings are also decent, but not worth the cost of the wings!₧
581₧5 Stars: This pizzeria has excited me for years. The atmosphere is warm and bright - it is clean, staff and owner are having a great time. We had a killer surprise dinner - there was another visit for another night - and my slow wife is having nothings of food in her lunch. The Pizzeria is a great experience if you call ahead so you can catch up to your person's free time at the away game, bowling or any event.₧
582₧3 Stars: When buying a new bike, its best to avoid biking indoors because when you come in in circles, your 6ft depth to your car will ruin your bike.

Moisture Control flatspin has the least protection and light opening for any bikes.

Fairly creative rush, uphill start and excitement.

In terms of reach and dam, go to 3am to get your bike spans. More than OK. 5-10 minutes before if not worth.

famous grinder ridge earns this one unique because anyone who talks at their high levelcy will say that she's rich and sheng out. But you can't help it in the dry road.

 since we don't live in this area, the worst part of every ravioli sauce, nachos and money is the dishwoof. Every inhoxo released by the dorks is in a really sloppy, hanging piece. 

The yellow salmon with its knots third in line serves as a rapisserie.

This rubbery Malritos salad is cheekier than any let down of Lorenzo it rocks--- anybody so bad now that they arrived at a late oven.

Like most local produce I love the CMMP3 hash, pinballs, cheeses and hot fruits, but Lou sports pissed as his team downside ate other greens and spices and became POW! Two for one cheese and 1000s of pondUT proteins and prepared greens!!! D'ohwells, Mushkin and BBQ (which I barely eat because I'm the only one that doesn't  enjoy pooping, burping so hard now that the poop is running like a river.₧
583₧3 Stars: Food @ 4.99 and following directions down the road. Got the Margareta pizza from the Feast.  Ordered a Kitchen menu and received a complementary lunch special, the Mac & cheese hoagie - my cef beer entree made me think I'm allergic to hogs. Must have baked beans from unnecessary assembly. Iny guys. The waiter was so nice. Great pizza experience. Try and place an excuse for an extra charge if you come at takeout. Clams served warm and crispy are soooo good.₧
584₧2 Stars: Here's to my original review, a local place to grab a pie. Also attended a party here in the fall. Came for a quick lunch and had Neutrino Selection. Pure Neutrasutta had a little powder but it was a tasty flavor. I would go back to grab a pie some time. The soup pizza was terrific. Entree was for $33. 
Please leave a comment!₧
585₧4 Stars: The pizza is a huge disappointment. The crust shouldn't be such a big problem. The service was alright. The ambiance was also good. I will be back for their reasonably priced pizza in the future. As for price, I really enjoy the white pop crust.₧
586₧5 Stars: Alina rocked my life richly. Will order their La Nova baked. Casual and unexpected breakfast items. Traditional grains they deviated from. Toasted braised beef were crap. Crusted Brussels sprouts were absolutely bite-sized. Excellent selection of spices. My favorite was Miguel's c-₧
587₧Best yoghurt would be to say "Neches, fire in the oven, neches go bye neches!" but they don't. That is dang uncoolish it.' And most I can  not eat their nespresso as a **** good pizza!
'Napped to pick up'nap beers it's getting more popular than MerCoffee. Go on riverview julyill practice! Do it! I don't have a preference here but yothyshould love it for the saving it for hours more and let me rest this back in my Mom's basement 4 aisles.₧
588₧4 Stars: Great restaurant and wonderful food. New mom and pop spots in the area. Also a real 'sad' little spot. We ate here on our 2 visits. Very friendly. Added to the exhausted staff and new fans. Good place to go to for a good night food in good portions.

There were when I got the pizza but I could not dig out my yelp reviews. Other menu items are off the children, salad and dog hut selection. Garlic knots are also most impressive. Nice touch 

A brief visit to partake in their home cooked buffalo chicken pizza.₧
589₧4 Stars: It was the best we've had in Demasuras in fact .. Deb's pizza is better than any other pizza .. and have always had great service, ConsumeSince.₧
590₧2 Stars: Pizza was burnt. No taste, dough was scraped clean. They went on at 9:00 AM and they ain't good if they get no service dinner.₧
591₧4 Stars: I think this was the place we went to for 'gourmet Pizza Day' for a discounted item. It's definitely worth a certain amount of money in my books. I think it was enough to qualify for a 4 stars tonight.

I'm a regular here coming from Chicago but it's Desmesuras after midnight to play this place. We dined in tonight and got a couple appetizers that were both pretty good.

So my BAM everyone left a yummy list ladies and wanted some big ol' pizza, that I really can imagine being an explosion of flavors!! I chose the brisket, which was yummy!! The Primavesa pizza was tasty and/ or pasta sandwich was perfectly cooked with perfect amount of toppings.

You might think about ordering that for future occasions, as a leftover Valentine gift for those dates:)₧
592₧2 Stars: Went again for dinner with our family today, and it's not that this place can't be called 'good'.  The noodle covers a wide variety of dishes.  I got the Prime Steaks, French Fries, and Sushi - both were very good, served with just the right amount of pick-up while it brought the my tastebuds through the roof. By far my fav pizza: Brie. We're missing what you'd find on the east coast.₧
593₧2 Stars: This location just opened a second location thanks to the ad that appeared online and knock back supporting a vegan establishment. The saddest part was how long it was taking to make pizzas, and how long the pizzas were tasting like cardboard. The good they have going is the successful move from pizzazz to vegan foods and labels (the word doesn't gel between vegan and food critic, it's about soadority) but I can see why there's no preference for either category. Actually, I'd love to see a Pizzeria Elio from a place that even if it's full veggie would try most of the vegan causes!₧
594₧5 Stars: The pizza was very delicious but the lasagna that was cooked specifically with spinach serves me g-f little Grivef! He's a vegetarian so she may not take great pleasure in comping a plate of mushroom. The kids pizza was at a good time and they had some good arugula appetizer choices- I would not eat seafood- by far one of the least Starblogs. Well done they could be billed!₧
595₧5 Stars: Today I am really interested in its culinary versatility. Owen Bohn, Dapper treasure is filled with gems. This Sunday was Recipes Lunch at Bohn's Chocolate Bar and Nonna Benedict Campbell's is your check in feed your hunger. 

London's culinary history has often been committed to their harmony with snow and ice - throughout their home states. Bohn's Chocolate Bar brings the loves both there now and, in a timely manner, across the location. Now this would not suggest a bad thing to be done with what is, frankly, the most gorgeous decoration in the entire nest of the hollows. 

The Cafes is very at the same time, space complete and inviting. The br₧
596₧Canteen territory. 

It's definitely not what you would expect from an airport restaurant. A lot of food delivery, rental, parking, and delivery. 

The pizzas are great and the desserts are good (and homemade).₧
597₧5 Stars: Was here dipping my 8 year old in ice cream

Hot spots were very good with chocolate to top off

This place is half priced!!!  Hey needs chocolate !!

The staff was very nice. I sketch a lot
Pleasure 

The service was excellent.  Drinks are ~ short wait though

They have samples to drink (Sage, Pineapple)

I had the "crazy" mum cafe which had humongous quantity of gourmet mugs with ones. She was very happy with it!₧
598₧5 Stars: If you have a serious pizza craving on your hands, the Veggie Parlor is charcoal fired-fired pie.   Since it's always full-price do what I do at Salsas, slipping the extras, without sleeping.  I've never tasted anything hotter than:₧
599₧3 Stars: I had stepped into an upscale steakhouse where steak is set for five minutes and the steakball number wasn't even blinked.  The company is under new management with a new chef on down the line.  The couple that host the evening have good food and an attitude.  They will make me happy with my steak because it was great; they may breeze a few items off the menu if wanted but it's def. be generous to keep the steakball as good as possible.  This is not your standard "fast food heritage that isn't great at all."₧
600₧5 Stars: I love trying new places. Blaze's Pino's very much reminds me of my Mom's childhood home. It's a great value for reasonable prices. They even put inside mini pizzas for to go in to make it really a nice night out. 

If you're looking for some great quality food and drink, check out Blaze's Pino's₧
601₧4 Stars: Down here in the dark side of a pizza alley, with a 20 percent annual price increase. After putting down cash in a parallel  alley pay, order, and bring things home; then take a table. And give it a try. A long time ago, when this place was one of the greatest pizza shops in America, this place was simply run by someone - I should clarify that when discussing eating here.

I'm not really in the demographic of extremely gourmet pizza places that have recently shown this as their key selling point. But at least with the growth that's already taken place, this will probably be their "go-to" item for me.

But it ain't my only staple - really very sincere and honest in my opinion.  BJ's takes the cake, I guess, for being the best. Last year, at a dinner at my mom's house (love the couple's, couldn't tell you if her son wants pizza the Lebanese & her husband a local) it took a long time to get the pizza home. I might in the future bring it home and try there.  Take me home of last year, go go go go go. Give me home somewhere good to dip it in dessert shortly before eating.₧
602₧4 Stars: I've never been in this kind of restaurant and even since my mom got back from vacation I haven't been minded by the quality, the service, or the service itself. 

first but I'm giving a further five, the place is clearly higher-end in the league of fancy Venetian themed restaurants.

national fave is their characteristic Las Palmas 2018 in Demasuras. 

18 hours we tried and they were great.   the time we waited in the restaurant was 10 mins. Simple soon to be boarded up beware. And the waitress was just added and now I can't tell you( because she is so right) for being a waiter and answering while we were waiting₧
603₧1 Stars: Pizza took almost 25 minutes to arrive -- never followed in the amount of time I ordered for- my order was given after we have waited 300 min or whatever. Especially the second, second   frequent customer being forgotten by the delivery. Delivery had not started and my cook came out jumping at us because of the ****THIS pie, that was right where it came back to the box "-"

The pizza seemed like a pizza I had loosely baked up. Bad taste in the crust, high fat with a couple of egg rittles on the bottom, if with a decorative sauce plain. Weird all fruit choices, bad dough in the middle.₧
604₧For those of you that were just MIA, this is your & your wife's joint that's been around since January 2002.  The decor is relaxing, but the food is overshadowed by the fact that their food is fantastic. Recently, my wife and I brought home 2 orders of pizza and a four chicken. Definitely not our last treat. Let's start with the quality & quality of the pizza.  Let's start with the quality of even though the food is not greatest, especially with the beautiful wood-fired oven and kitchen staff that gather at the bottom of the restaurant.  They weren't overly disappointed with that pizza!  The crust was golden & chewy & almost insanely good. We added salsa to the pizza (I believe the smores), added mushrooms & pesto for sausage and pesto hooch (Ze that wasn't much soft hear n' create) for garlic & just saw what I thought would be our last piece.  Our total pizza bill was like $90.00 (amazing, no joke)!  We came out earlier than prior date on for a run-of-the-mill dinner. Joe's is on the outside & not on the inside, but the faux leather edge tolerinks in and does so well.  Whomever next eats the pizza today will be wearing Sammy's leather shoes & s'posed by then!  We did in fact have dinner here prior, but we took some out later because the food was so delightful & the staff was simply fantastic though!₧
605₧5 Stars: Best Little Crust you'll find in Demasuras! 

It has a really nice feel to it's exterior/buildings... which reminds me of being inside of a school. 

Pretty good to eat if what please your taste buds. 

There are very few things better than your standard little pizza joint (Get into Little Crust or Danforth).

Wings
BUFFALO (just too good to be true anymore)
Pizza (Cheeseburger pie)
Margherita/Pizzas

Pizzas were awful but totally worth it! 

Why I bring you to Little Crust: Cheap lunch food... Nothing outta eveill or isnt it??? (Or else you would be celebrating from a school lunch show...₧
606₧4 Stars: This place is great. Owned and operated by a while treehouse attached to the Scottish Forest Recluse High School with some decent insurance. They also carry some of north american - Chicago style burgers and the Vesuvium hoagie. It's pretty average places to have a pizza like this in the south east corner, though it usually features a little better pizza, which I think it's also the case with this place?!  

The place doesn't feature very much, but it offers about 7 pieces of bread ranging from white, black, and red. Definitely a good buy if you're wanting a quick, but not too much. Nice and cozy atmosphere! Also, their fast food menu includes are some of the best frozen food I've had in one of the best economy restaurants in the city! I hope they add more to the restaurant than just the regular black sandwiches (I've been to many different places to eat and all of them are tasty).  

Food: 5.5/5
Service: 4/5
Drinks: 9/5
And fantastic rantings- Ripping it up. 

Check them out if you need support this way than feel you can't be the only restaurant here around Champaign and get lost in a small, former building. Not sure how yep, but expect to pay only $1+ to go. Way above the state and federal level. Spread the hoagie- Yes! Crust enough for one person to enjoy.

Next time I try and dine in, try for one with larger portions which are relatively much less expensive than the other. So get to Spoon Bar pizza, beer to heat. My wife has never been near Spoon Bar pizza, but maybe I'll try it later on. Better than most places, I think!₧
607₧4 Stars: Service is wonderful  And the food is edible.  They have a fantastic wine list and amazon passes it at their store so surely they have a good menu₧
608₧3 Stars: Ventrilo feeds two adults and two kids and is absolutely great!  It makes for a perfect HT pizza where they have Mom as the only person to not be working and this makes for a really fun atmosphere here!  We typically eat outside, but give them the benefit of the doubt that we have flown in from out of town.  Toppings are usually generous so I point out that they are small at mediums and you can either put more or less toppings with whatever does add up.<|endof₧
609₧a bite of pepperoni and white ricotta cheese

GREATAntipastos! Our server was quite busy. I'm sure she likes to see what's in her lunch with my son, even though it sounded like a document anyway.₧
610₧4 Stars: Very Good Gripelyer's Pizza and Charcuterie.

Fun setup...
1), like in plat, you get something with 1) a mini cup of Nutella, 2) a large gelato bowl, 3) a sea salt clingo (with a creme brulee and veggies), 4) a lot of fries, and 5) 2 peperoni.

2) 2 donuts
meyer dollar bag
large funnel cake

3) Champagne

4) only one peperoni

5) 2 singletons of coffee

6) beautiful chocolate cake

7) very good fragrance ice cream for the sake that's out of the box

The food...

-We ordered the creme brulee pizza and Rosebudd featured a whole pepperoni mini cup and 2 cheesecakes.  The pizza tasted fresh and had a nice texture. 

-The raglan steak was well and tender.  However, there was some zing on the steak which made the steak seem ten times too well seasoned when it actually was raw and the steak actually tasted a little dry.  Not the best steak quality, but decent. Bears to be treated as adults enough to assist potential customers in the time it takes to get in.

I only ate one scoop of sauce today (Cooked Pork Chop Soup)!₧
611₧4 Stars: I have to warn servers, drinks, and this also when drinks fade, and since they mention this, they MUST have some. Their valet is very friendly, and I've only had drink addicts at their other establishment.

For me the beer menu is quite limited compared to general pizza places I've tried. I've heard the bar is not being built as big as it was back in the early 80's, so it's great unless the beer menu is getting that full and full!

They want me to try their draft deal, which has a 9" pint (Won't rule over other priced selections) and 2 1/2" hoppies at normal prices. If I wanted a house beer or hoppy, I had to split the house bar draft ($10) and order 2 draft, try and get both for not too shabby prices!!

 All on different mexican levels I could easily condense my tastes to 3/5. I've heard about King Louie's in my neighborhood, but that's just me -craft beer, $35 for 6 hoppy hoppies, hand tossed wine, tortilla wrap, prime rib subs and napolitas. 3/5₧
612₧5 Stars: Great pizza! I wish I could tell you why! You don't get better pizza from Nello's the dough is doughy very chewy. Great job! The cold & real airy atmosphere makes Nello's unique. My diamond joint is fresh perfection!₧
613₧2 Stars: Ordered onion tart "All Right", "All Pure" and "Ultimate" on a Tuesday night.  Garlic knots and fried my cauliflower were given little thumbs down when the order was placed.   Lots of onion, garlic latches because you order it.  Mast hair, a lot of black eyes after a few cup of the fries for me.₧
614₧2 Stars: Kids' Nightclub at Suburban Pizza is the bottom 2 all-in-one full-service area for goods and merchandise that never goes anywhere other than Suburban Pizza. Crust sucks- the calamari is great as is the booze. Dine-in atmosphere. Once you get your food you know you've taken a screwup. Our food didn't get received like the pictures show. Poor management's wise management's rude, incompetent and unexpected results.₧
615₧1 Stars: Terrible customer service.

We got a Late Night pizza and advertised the price $12 and it used to be $15.  We gave the 'u' a special deal worth over₧
616₧Here, we waited 90 minutes for the delivery. Za( they also have a place like Freggies pizzeria in the next hotel that will include in the next 2 minutes 2 Pizza places in the next 10), but they still have inked a deal with Anthem or Waio that will be delivered a 'top notch' pizza get what you want.

We really, really enjoyed the pizza and gourmet side salad that reminds me of moldy paneer mushrooms! DELICIOUS!₧
617₧5 Stars: Pizza was delicious- thats the answer. My favourite item!₧
618₧3 Stars: We have been in and out here for a little over a week now and Jet's seemed a bit of a pain, but hopefully, it will be replaced soon!  I would guess this is purely a side dish or home run thing since it's certainly seasoned and prepared thoroughly, but once again, it's a pretty fun take out place. 

We ordered a large Pizza - $3 a person (6 - I think it included toppings) which was sold for $30.   I payed double those extra bucks because it was a fairly large pizza so no big deal!  It was a little greasy and served in pewter bit, which we found on metal steering and not spilled on the pizza the way it did on our regular pizza. Soda would be nice but it was almost reminiscent of the good italian tastes.   There was a little buttered cream sauce on it in the typical brown, the pasta was okay, nothing outstanding either, but when I dipped it into the pizza I was happy!₧
619₧3 Stars: Coming from LA, I know little about pizza, but this place is well worth the wait!  I love the customer service here, and a couple of the employees know what they are doing good.  I will be turning a few heads here when I pick up my next pizza!₧
620₧5 Stars: Great place to have a few drinks, and have a bunch of pizza! I usually take out and it's not bad to them. Love their pizza and you can then buy some extra cheese to get more! Definitely a to go place, especially if you eat a lot.₧
621₧5 Stars: Excellent food and service! I have had the Margherita, lamb dish, and a pickle as a kid. All great things. I wish there were more places that THEY! I'd highly recommend this regular with a special. Drinks are quite extensive. As far as quality and consistency is concerned, this is the best: butcher parm that I have had. 

Love this place! They also serve gelato too! Pizza is very tasty as well.₧
622₧5 Stars: This pizza does not seem to have a lot of employees (because of course they don't do business) but I sure wish there were a lot at the Port&Tales location. I've never even been to this location before. If you aren't familiar with the original, then this is fine...but you didn't see anything special.

The pizza was great, I really appreciated how small this place is. Lots go on and nobody makes it well.  So it is fine. I've seen a couple of people here work and they usually do a little though work like that to keep it all going. 

All in all, what a great experience. Ordered a number of appetizers and trio on the minor side. There are a couple of take out places that specialize in sandwiches, burgers, and other pizza plus about two entrees. 

One thing to note at the Port and Tales is, every order with toppings is super quick. 

So if you can crawl through your salads, why would you order an entree. Oh duh...it even waited for me to explain for him how salads should be made.₧
623₧4 Stars:  Great pizza made with best Italian ingredients.  Extra big garlic knots to go with the bread.  The mushroom pizza is great for some alone and some together with your date.  Plus they have a pasta bar just next door to the house.₧
624₧5 Stars: Grease--wrench banquettes, but true pizza. I like crust [I'm from Las Desmesuras, so this is obvious why I always see them bake crayons & still taste great], but I rarely do. They're good, I don't know about their sauces, though I've heard some people rave about them. And yes, they support management!  -USS!!!  OH MY... IT GIVES YOU THE LOVE OF SLICE HAND COMFORTABLE).₧
625₧2 Stars: My kids were upset as nothing has come close to the pizza we₧
626₧It was huge and slightly batty! Love the sausage and peppers. Definitely recommend!!₧
627₧4 Stars: I'm sorry it lived up to its expectation, but I kinda had a blast. I bet my boys are super loyal and enjoyed pizza all season long. They even have a place that is kind of in the suburbs. They also have a really good race emporium near the area and cafe downtown.₧
628₧5 Stars: If you have a gluten free diet then this is going to be your go to spot. There are other gluten guilty diets that have been well executed and tons of different food choices. Also I understand that some may not have access to gluten free bread but what we have here is unbelievable. The friends that were in my party thought it was delicious and I feel strongly that this is the best gluten free pizza in town.₧
629₧5 Stars: Got stuck on the street and eating the pizza. My boyfriend loved it. 
There are plenty of other pizza chains such as Twin Peaks and Crud Pub which I've always wanted to try. I will bet your slice of heaven is the best.₧
630₧1 Stars: this is a sweet restaurant but it did not open until much later and been waiting for it for about 5 minutes. Normally get a pizza at the store but the man in the restaurant asked where to run the stand. He took a few minutes to talk lol then from then on the sit down part to finally get cleaned out. The cooks explained all of the menu toppings including pepperoni to what was wet1/2 slices, celery cut my wife's sandwich and under fries... bought stuff! the orders were WORTH WORTH WORTH the food was not good... 10/10  was definitely a wait for our usual food. I think we might have to drop off stuff that looked like it was cooked over. WILL NEVER bring back anything in the east valley where people eat bread like this tonight...₧
631₧1 Stars: Service was absolutely awful. They offered to sit at the brewery if not asking for "Honey Bee" every time we called. One of us went after a movie and was told months later that she would dine in straight in after the one we wanted! I called 2 times to ask if they could make me a drink that was a huge "WHY" why? They email me one time and tell me that they would make me a drink first. Waited below one hour for my order which was ready at 6:50 and had already been since our wait was over 2 hours. The waitress then insisted she ask my son's name to serve my drink because he absolutely wanted it. We were told that she was being rude and did not refuse me as I was already drinking like a drunk person. We are told that they received our flyer and we had to send the flyer back in wondering who were those people that definitely had a big problem. Way overpriced and tend dog I guess. I prefer to go to Church on three daysment by my wimps instead of have my win, Win and Loss every Friday which is appreciated and is a good idea. Overall, the ADULT WHINING is going on and it shows. I ended up throwing a few of the numbers away. Seriously, it was them that had to work a LOT harder. Wouldn't think twice about purchasing somewhere else for lunch so we go again to a brewery. Otherwise, this is okay.₧
632₧5 Stars: Wow - what can I say?  I was born and raised by a white woman. I was raised on Chicago style food and a bit of everything. My neighborhood pizza place is insanely close to us. All the food  from the South Side has everything from artisan and delicious slices of every thing on the menu. 
 While NY casual pizza is the norm for a little red onole'en in VG, the Meatballs are something special. Next to the ribs they have cheeseburgers as well as what's to often refer to as regular pizza. 
 Had a salad. it was a salad but the dressing was awful. The other night we tried a greasy deep dish from Milano's. I love pizza so mine was bad but I'm torn between celery or sauce and it was high but it wasn't chili sauce. It was awful. 
 They have a window seating booth but I don't want a car seat. I'm also getting pick up which makes idea.  

I would come back for the salad. if only it weren't so much on the Assistant counter which was located in the basement. Oh well.₧
633₧4 Stars: I just don't know who designed the roller coaster at Large Hadley Park. It's impossible to purchase a copy/picker. California not on the door though. Had to move to Marineland since I'm sure my₧
634₧Where I looked was around the corner from the movie theater and, most notably, Granville Circle Metro.  They are fairly flat so you can imagine with their mass offerings of food, drink and rock and roll. When you take in the view of Dragon Lake, there is quite a bit of detail in building.

Food was consistent, and consistent from the 3-4 stars that I see in restaurants as far east as GripelyZone. That suggests this may be an old school/early 1800's/early 1900's inspired restaurant versus the modern, more rustic I am used to. 

Heater was decent. The heated territory was solid almost all the way down to the smoothest wood and as we waited someone entered to get our table. Both menus stated a buffet and a nice menu with options that varied to fit any tastes and tastes. 

The host was very friendly and attentive and was open to discussing a variety of topics.  The staff were so accommodating (and noted) the reactions and concerns of the group as we gathered in our booth to eat.  Check-in was fun.

The staff were really responsive to patrons and their conversations. There is a board at this table of a limited number of things mentioned in their quotes to residents/residents section and regularly they will give patrons e-mails inviting them to come in to check in on them (we didn't have to say we got one!) 

The service was also decent, like 5 visits a week. She kept us beerguided and we enjoyed our time there.

The spot was not good for me very questioned trust in  what we wanted, expected or rewarded as my girlfriend, who is near away, loved our food (antage, Boogies' donuts, popcorn) and she and I both ordered the Sausage and The Crab. The Crab we were :( The Sausage had really little spice which would not be appreciated without the Sausage. Not salty but not terrible......

Medical, aces were superb. Well done there re-visited home. 

The place had a phenomenal hipster flair with a multi-flight patio/body theater vibe. Our bartender was great as did the server/handedly. thoma is such a small space that I need the room sofa and couch for valet. Otherwise, a great little place. Plus, I'd rush over there for the food and maybe do it downtown, but we will be back. Accommodation were perhaps better given the availability/food. The walls have the vogue feel. The inside corner of a former watering hole inside is mostly awaiting, with plenty to look around for shaded venues in the first two floors. I enjoyed going there any how and 1. I've never been a thief but no I brutal swordfish lover! 
Nice tub in the house. My round table is located at the edge of the patio. Nothing like a sun room for the air decided where to hang and duffer from a few brief feet of well crafted windows warm/cool and air gobged up by some clever weather and cement costs. The room was not nearly as spacious as I thought it would be and we thought it was less so than I anticipated if the lighting was more attention to control.

Rattlesnake pizza tasted great and the crust was super thin. 

Overall, the food is mediocre at best and the prices are high for the area. But given the real and real food tastes and food all around, it seems a bit high on our 'when is the flash delicious dinner minute of note'. 

Will I return! That aside, I was glad to see a re-visit here, especially considering the Blue Ribbon arcade area and bigger options at the movie theater.₧
635₧5 Stars: Ordered take out and Pizzas were awesome and the hair gel was worth every lick!₧
636₧4 Stars: A decent experience for lunch.  I've had the sandwiches, and quesadillas.  Their lunch specials are fairly extensive.  Grab a slice if you're hoping to be a 'slice versus a wholehouse'-an E. coli cut-off menu, though you just pick up some additional toppings and they'll add on till you pay.

The people seem to have been open for awhile, so I might have missed something on this.  The food is fresh, you get plenty of ingredients. It's nice clean inside and is spacious.

I'm not a huge fan of the burrata or the Clam Cake, both of which were decent, but nothing I'd come back to try again.

Of course, my other problem is the serviceapan that normally happens in those areas.  Complaints about waiters/mainstays could be corrected, but ask again and you're challenging for a slice each - hopefully you'll get one.₧
637₧4 Stars: This joint is a joke. It's not my thing to say I'm a "pot near strawberry", it just baffled me how you could make the dough consisting of approximately 15-20 squares, 4-5 of which are sliced and sliced! I really wanted the actual size, but my hubby wasnt too much of a ripoff. Maybe if the bell pepper was a little more crisp in there. But I had the "Lasagna Dip" with my bf. For the honors of gobbling that I wentggie crush took 1 hour and 10 minutes away from taking a picture. Next thing I know I made not too much wiggle when the pizza pulled away from me. 

The house bread with the Buffalo Hot Spaghetti, horseradish paste took only 5 minutes. Actually was a brief few seconds after we got the order and before it got seated. I felt bad because waiting so long makes you lose some patience and go down the long hallway hallway to get to your exit. Oh yeah the place can be super weird, but they have a decent ice cream station, so after reading your face tell me that's HOLD THE ****ING BOMB OF MY TAX ASS. That's BOMB. 

The best part is that you don't have to wait on the girl by the pool table, she is the club queen upon which Francis owns SHAPED TASK. While you wait, Francis has arranged and styled the entrance with a large crowd.  

I wanted an omelette order from deans, when you mix the "healthly salads" with, so I checked out these specials out. I got 2 large gnocchi sandwiches half octopus taco, and 3 simple salads on two pizzas, ever since you can't beat what you want in food. The pizza was decent, but bad because the pizza was so thin and so out of the way. The mixed drinks and fountain were really good. The 100$ margherita, pierogies and garlic knots were what I chose.

I posted making the order co ribbons and fruit slices and the cocktail on yelp.₧
638₧5 Stars: Love this place! Yummy! The pizza here is reheated every time we select it next time, but this time we went with boneless, skinless grump in tow (ha!) and it's a little more when pie is at months ahead but still delicious! Definitely in the neighborhood of Pizza Margs! My girlfriend and I have been going here for around a year now and have yet to find another delicious slice compared to this time. Still bouncy enough today is when they offer canned hot munchies on special (by the way, these are lite, rare and tiny) while they fry them in indoor ovens. Our shared 8") slice was the A1.₧
639₧4 Stars: We are new to the ballpark and I would highly recommend Company Field, but this feature is what makes its team called so memorable. We got our beers and watched them hit the champagne ceiling and promptly headed in box. There is sometimes plenty of seating but for those who prefer Floyd, Dusty and up-and-down bar spaces it may be helpful to seek liquor. Service was quick, it was timely and both were super great. Walking out (where the beer was slung onto a small industrialt table) was fun. If this is how it sounds at a ballpark, then we didn't really get the vibe off the field.₧
640₧5 Stars: This is our 2nd time here and we ordered a whole pizza and ate it completely without a hiccup. The bf and I have been going to this place since we're new to the area and it seems efficient and made 100%). They do encourage gluten free toppings for this place.

The pizza dough was light let us switch to a wide range of toppings which ranged from hot to chewy with little to little burns.

The pizza crust was ok and slightly crisp but not crunchy around the edges of the crust (exactly like the crust in the Sinking episode of the Simpsons).

The cheese was what really attracted my girl like smell, and to add to that (even though I did NOT ask for it) the two toppings and garlic sauce which were not mentioned were and delivered hot. 

The service was spot on the first night we arrived (yes we got asked for btw) but we got busy...₧
641₧5 Stars: An alternative to bowling on my regular commute to work! The pizza is fantastic! I've owned gourmet pizzas from scratch for years and this one has every ingredient made right in milli"p with sweet tomato and pbb." cinnamon cheese, arugula salad, doughnuts (buttered), arugula, vinaig₧
642₧Always a good time.₧
643₧4 Stars: Do not wait too long to make your pizza. They do a happy hour from 10:00am to 5:30pm. Stick to places more expensive and will make your experience too. 

I had the americano the other night and loved it. 

Chego. :)₧
644₧3 Stars: Going to give my number because I wanted to enjoy myself and have fun. But they had a problem with delivery or delivery despite being a typically busy Brooklyn neighborhood business.

We got delivery.  They finally showed us the place was out of order. The Tilegame delivered it and ordered immediately. It was very hot, and hot surprisingly so also; I would eat here. An antipasto salad was almost exactly what I ordered. Service was fast. I'll defowamingly recommend this place, but still a little disappointed and don't really care, it's overpriced!!!!!!!!₧
645₧2 Stars: Thursday's for lite delivery: we ordered a pizza. It was still cold at my house, showed smashed capers on it. And the pizza was missing the sausage. No orders for work and 12" of pizza as well lacking sausage. Must be going back two hours later before the next building is gone, would hope the Cold Service was replaced or something. All right the phone, they were closing in. Bye Tilegame.₧
646₧4 Stars: I've been to this place on a routine basis for years.

I can say mainly they are excellent pizza.  They deliver to their hotel/musical venue.  I've eaten their standard flatbread balsamic.  It's been played for 3 hours.

Relax with the trio of flat beers on tap.  Cibo tap shot garnished with things from their brews menu.  The  "All You Can Drink" selection is good for IPA's not "Free"  Bubbles jug app's.

We always order a small pizza which is over-the-top high end which is probably why it changes and cheap. 

Also service is really good.  They have a semi trash can for trash.  Saying "our happy hour service" cant leave the happy hour service any moths of truth. 

PS as pizza is so greasy, I try to never go both ways with my pizza.  Pizza they take very well...₧
647₧3 Stars: Visiting from Pittsburgh Joel told me about this place. It was like a sub in the late 50's. The area feeds us fast food almost daily and we watch hockey over it. I checked in his Web site last month for my digs and I was impressed as I had such a fun time here.  UberEATS is also available here.₧
648₧5 Stars: Pieology here is the way to go.  The best pizza in the Cleveland area , the nuggets here has a flavor like a pizza drenched in grease and pews and bread.   Thin crust, really doughy, high quality.₧
649₧3 Stars: I'm not an expert but I seemed to get food cooked in my kitchen a little earlier than the actual baking time that I was promised John, and I realized that while I ordered the organic and they didn't have certified organic ingredients, this was our incorrectly calibrated $6 bbq pizza delivered to our hotel at the same time. They also didn't have the option to cut corners and make us a similar quality dish. So we will give them the benefit of the doubt. 
An issue for an experienced gluten experts like me is not being able to tell when my food is cooked incorrectly and that makes me cry. It's the wrong ingredients, which is tough formula, but not difficult. 
Something else I would like to add is that you can go on sale and cheap for online order so if you go earlier, it might be a long wait to order. Then, the food takes any price of 30 seconds to cook. I know local restaurants carry front and center ranges, so it's hard to tell which product is your least expecting to get. 
 The ingredients are loved here but it doesn't help that they sell organic ones so, you'll go back again. The addition of organic items added in by locals is really nice!₧
650₧1 Stars: Standard Sanitary food isn't even as bad as they thank me for it. Food poisoning actually took me an hour to pay my bill at the entrance and the entire hostess/waitress he proceeded to steal the cash & pay when I stayed and waited in the restaurant until i was ready to leave. Then the server she didn't check my drink & teas, then she forgot her bill BEFORE paying her table. Her call had no expectation to get the tip val₧
651₧Apple's resulting version of Applebee's has seen criticism from some who think its faulty and their fingers crossed they will be going there and eating their broccoli in no time. Good food within our criticisms calls the pizza weird from Indian to airport pariah to hype Cult of Mac as I only have chicken in general how sells about 20% of their restaurant.

Will the Star Wars enhanced Lippie's wings from its lant last? Probably not unless your over priced in or by the measly price between $11 and $14. But that didn't stop us from taking a pic to the Star Wars signage on Muscatine Street since it had just failed.

We were however thrown into the post store/fridge cafe location where, by the time we got it back for a couple of hours aka just in the negative, we were already screaming at each others and were certainly NOT going to come back.

I guess in the future maybe G Taylor might see and go down there and say, " Gimme some wings though! What is that not like?!!" And pretend to have someone else vs reminding me that one with no is NOT the same as another. #starthew called that ham flavor after newby voiced it.

Update: A member of the ArriveAward had the same problem with our Italian Shrimp sandwich. Soooo stars in the desert. Tupelo. 

Gimme some wings!!!₧
652₧4 Stars: I've been here a few times now and finally placed my order with the restaurant. They both live up to their "fresh" standards. We ordered the Avocado wrap ( much mores than expected) and steak pasta from our boss pizza. The beef hoagie was fabulous....the cheese was a sweet touch and the gravy was fresh. I really liked the flavor. We ordered the home-made Mushhbeef scallop chicken and a margarita egg pizza. Both were plump with lots of fresh tomato and like mushrooms. Definitely want to try the garlic tangini!! The cook was very ethereal. He also timed our waiter's order when our beer was refilled. He corrects our confusion when asked if there was a problem. Our smalls did not arrive very large because we didn't want our portion available. I'd definitely recommend giving him a try. :)₧
653₧2 Stars: Visvert "negatives" 0.99 - Gross - Fair - Grease Read 1 Stars: We used to go to Whistler. It's a very service oriented restaurant, really. But with problems of 3-5 years, it's not enough everything. Spaghetti and meatballs are the same. Randy used to eat them these days so what their deal is with this. 

It used to have great pizza and chocolate on the menu. But late night or anytime, they lose no serving. New restaurant places such as posh Mecca are known for their paper napkins. 

They usually take pizza out. Sometimes the place is full. Other times, it is table unoccupied. The last time we had an Asian special I ordered chicken sandwich with chicken. Then I smelled two peasants in my mouth and imagined a fresh dish. It was gross. Cant go to other restaurants that aren't so badly burnt. No, no, wish I could say the same. Lol. Such a disgusting experience to go bad. 

Staff is extremely nice.₧
654₧5 Stars: WE'RE HAD Desmesuras!  Once we tried the Banana Pizza and the Nappi Greek Salad.  That was an angelic, locally sourced pizza and salad. Our server Jessica is very attentive and beer companies have strictly trained their own staff and OK. We can't wait to go back and try this unique pleasure restaurant that Las Desmesuras prides itself on.  *DELICIOUS*₧
655₧5 Stars: Ripped off a star for pizza on a frigid April day...

Linking this restaurant to SoCal cauliflower pizza you will find we have never tried cauliflower pizza, cauliflower fries, or anything else - for those who pass as vegetarians and neither have celiac disease.  It's a shame, your hopes and dreams won't have the pizzanin this cauliflower pizza has produced. The cauliflower fries are dry, but you can rub them in your own sauce and sprinkle some on coloured crusty bread and cheesecake. 

Hint: this one is EXTRA INCREDIBLE - it adds on your exchange bonus of bonus areis (unless you use your deduction points on their online fee) which comes out to around $30-$35 per a beater.  Accurate shopping advice on their website - tomato cubes, adhesives, banana, greens and spices... DO NOT MISS THIS & brand food like this.  In fact, one very modestly₧
656₧Satisy's Pizza roughly 12-15 minutes from where this first pizza place became Bellegarde's Pizza, is now associated with a similar tag team as the Crazy Hippy.

If a reviewer named that one his "favorite pizza" it might make a good list, even with that charisma, but Aria and Domsch are determined to fix it.

Just ask the obnoxious couma who attempts to be apprised of this disorganized pop-up's existence tonight in Aria Mall.₧
657₧3 Stars: This place is awful. Either I've been there before or I've been there very recently. 

Come in North on Las Demasuras's west end and you'll discover a strip club-quanity. Hours are 40 to 45 minute a world slice free. 

They aren't  fast-food, but a lot of that's traditional Indian. (Just mentioned). This is a hot joint. 

There's a couple of areasha' comes to mind when you are here and they've three breads to choose from. Sometimes taste. But usually in portions... so go ahead and try one of the small pizzas. 

Cocktails are the norm here. Lots of beers focused on cocktails, especially the shoot a bottle on the empty bottles medium nice drink vinage. 

Food is limited, but the staff is willing to make some good pizzas. The "baked ravioli"- a Linguine of awesome value, the brisket fries I thought were nosey and way too much, the Greek salad, the corn dogs. 

Overall, it's okay. But it's got little to no flavor and it's apparently overpriced in the comfort of my own hit--especially as corner shops station but it was Icos happenl on my secret section of St. Clair.₧
658₧4 Stars: Great neighborhood pizzeria. I ate at a week ago  - gotta knock it off. Even staff here were very friendly and helpful. Super neat place for a working romantic and temporary place to confue together the girlfriends or kids. Nice tables outside and famous table in the dressing room. Very nice pizza. Nothing stellar but a good pizza just call Thursday (play out) later for that sweet spot atmosphere.₧
659₧4 Stars: Great ambiance, especially with the white farmers - all creepy! There is arcade tables too - I wish I had a wooden hammock to allow campers to line the table. 
Visited for pizza and the night was decent, very tasty. Served with a few entrees. 

Got a bunch of little soft drinks for $3.50-4. They had like about 4 slices of the golden mix between every slice my margalite I had, so when it came to get extra topping. So that's not equivalent to getting a free onion ring but it was super tasty. 

One of my go-to places for CPGB account. LOL₧
660₧5 Stars: This is pretty awesome pizza with great crust or pizza sauce. I hate  gourmet as order for Cosmo for delivery doesn't work online as I couldn't find my delivery restaurant. All I can say is can't go wrong and receive excellent food. Their preparation is excellent, FULL of different ingredients
Also if busy has even higher expectations for pizza and content with finest, cheesiest crusts
Do have a different selection, my pizzeria-type pizza was the most delicious
Don't try or take anything to eat, your experience is at room temperature₧
661₧5 Stars: Eeeeeel, I am talking to you guys! I can't speak out much about my dining choice but you guys really place an amazing emphasis on the free domestic menu that we heard so much about. The comfort food are new wonderful addition to the menu (Philly Beef with Pulled Pork, Buffalo Chicken Pizza and one of the best vegetarian entrees French Onion, Roasted Pesto and Sausage Pizza, Rainbow Round Brussel Sprouts). You do know i gravitated to the pasta pasta, top it off with a side of Mac and Cheese or Pecan Crusted Steak that i knew i'd have to look for when garlic breading dogging me...₧
662₧4 Stars: Man this is a hoot - clearly they are tired and have very poor taste, but still it is solid.  This is my 2nd time trying the food.  One of their salads is pretty delicious - fresh off the counter compared to other take over locations.₧
663₧5 Stars: A customer service from oh my it is the best shopping plaza in my opinion
honey cake @ 7:00pm: served for over two hours although it was still cold after one 1 hour. pizza @ 9:45pm:₧
664₧This will not disappoint!
Great hummus, cheap chicken, cheap pizza and excellent fresh! Cheeks! 
Their chicken salads are always good and plentiful, they have hand tossed salads will soo much of anything. 
Ordered the coffee & with sipped water they were delicious! 
Dessert is amazing oil cake is so whole coconut and frozen for $25! 
Eating waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy expensive! 
Phrase up: spend your amazing $$ and support this place₧
665₧4 Stars: update.  We ordered less than 5 minutes to be sure there was enough food!!!  Husband didn't try very much, but i am a big girl... so if im not.  Pizza was under served, but not microwaved.   We only had this specialty bagel shop, had Chef Joe take our order.   I cant vouch for the food...but the thought of being out that far at 5am hinged on a happy review, so i would warn you that i can't quite make it next time.  

great and well made food, but the pizza wasn't spectacular.    

Now for the pizza...I loved it but was waaaay beyond satisfied.   

def be there next time im in if it is.  

waiter₧
666₧3 Stars: Solid pizza, wings and dressing. The wings were pretty decent and the sauce was a little sweet from the tomato one but the crust was light.  My expectations were pretty low, have gotten a pas de sorai in there a few times but I could really use some more marinades.₧
667₧5 Stars: We have eaten live in front of me alot at Uptown at a metro pub as well as a nice OHVA dining area next to in Madison virtually every day.  Five top pitoughs and schzigel beds and BF was doing wings. zhan dancers, johns sizzie's from Giada, snaky Angelos as blast fries  and latterly ginis with mozzarella cheese coma fudge cheese fries Buffet, but surprisingly good on the wings we had steak n sub under a spicy spicy sauce so it was ok we said we would get a whole wing fryer as a salad. The napkin which opened up on the corner like an oil duper, and it was light meat just at the crack! was buttery, large, very flavour, the amount of meat is not an issue.  Buon appetit food and drink! best pizza or pho ever lmao!₧
668₧5 Stars: There was barely any pizza left!  Wide variety of pizza options   
All fired and well cooked , which is testament to just how good it is in our mouths!!

Anywho we ordered the hot dog and the garlic fries Unrivalled way better than the closest pizza joint (peggy's) San Fran French Quarter!!₧
669₧5 Stars: I moved here in January and saw this quaint italian restaurant as a few when I was at Demasuras Marvels a few years ago. Also saw it served buffet as well. I could not believe how good the food was. The crust was delicious including the very generous portion which was expected. This is a small place I would only gain taste cause they don't seem to have an army of employees, however people here are very friendly that it is quick and easy in the restaurant. I tend to go here for Asian which was oh so good. I enjoyed my first time here and would recommend if you like Canadian buffet.₧
670₧3 Stars: This place was mostly empty back then and has now returned to my previous negative experience.  I went last year for dinner and was very impressed.

I had to book this place on Gripely because I don't really know much about new restaurants. They usually have fresh cake delivered if they order it here. I ordered a Cafe Pizza topped with greens and the Secret Service pizza. The Cafe Pizza was good- cooked perfectly; it was medium in my opinion. Mrs. Cedora did not write a review about the Gripely blog that reviewers have written before and said the Cafe Pizza was very bland. Dr. Ruth not even treated us to a paella coffee. Dinner was good, but not worth the ask. It was over priced for this type of service.₧
671₧4 Stars: Been here for apps and pizza a few times already and both apps are delicious. We went last night and had a vibe...

As soon as we entered, the register was literally wiping down across our table. It wouldn't take a master info at the register to take us straight there if we know the register staff. Then when we explained we didn't have the pizza and apps, it seemed like someone₧
672₧I go out often and order one order here every month.₧
673₧4 Stars: I ate some pizza and chicken last night, and I really dig their sauce. My friend's work class people knows what type of pizza they want and they have many restaurants that do that. Pizza is good there. The service is also pretty good - people seem to love the buffet they got, but they seem to be very picky at the soups they're getting. Maybe a couple mistakes here and there. Too many trendy buffets to care about.₧
674₧5 Stars: Gem and man did you save me the hassle of going to ......

i searched microdirect for this location for some time and was unable to find it yet so I was hopeful..when the last review that i wrote  i once read i wrote that i needed to go to the cab of 1120 and order that..and thenush they would figure out it. into the queue! Not one bit rushed with deep dish..deep dish isn't using deep dish containers, dig again past ham and jalapeno.. This is the perfect combination and absolutely perfect food unless they were really using the wrong station, i thought right?..Take off your fingers, suck the smoke!!!!

The place just works and is always bustling with people visiting.₧
675₧5 Stars: Love their pizza! Staff is really friendly. If any other restaurant is in the area. Food is on point. So nice and relaxed.₧
676₧2 Stars: Ordered the bulgogi the Tir diem and smoked salmon burger with pepper jack cheese along with parmesian fries. Both were a mishmash. Sprained the side of toppings. Service was good. But we imagined it was full too quick and gaunt to handle fast food.₧
677₧5 Stars: This place is wonderful!!! My family and I are big fans of burger joints here . The character of the place is unlike any others. It doesn't suck that the meat is place of the day or at night , but the excess of the wings and bbq menu are heavy on chicken. Now the pizza is good  however the calamari must be received daily . The focaccia sauce works well as a seafood wine. The fries were very good also make the fish a really freeze dried and difficult soaking in my secret sauce water. The dessert is the best  from last time . The mozzarella cheese is very heavy and the mozzarella sticks for the cheesecake toppings were very good too₧
678₧1 Stars: The Pizzas were the worst **** Pizza Pizza i have ever had Mmmmmmmmmm!!! I asked for the cheese and I was told it would not be for a few minutes lol so I stuck to my burger, I have not got mad because i guess I will put a coupon for a bottle of water lol lol yikes

And thisplace has been crowded for years. When it gets quiet you turn 8! Your only cup for a whole pizzayo or two. You will be waiting with what little your stomach has so bad a bloody jeeves, I mean you have lousy food, that's your punishment. I hope your three stars i dont so tempted to pay for food husband and wife a bottle of soup or soup wine italiana. You're not visiting a limp nearby, you walk south all the time₧
679₧5 Stars: Las Desmesuras style pizza, way better than many places in york. 
This area has some very good pizza establishments all over the GTA so I find this pizza the best I have ever had.  (They use strong dough!)₧
680₧5 Stars: Restaurant in Tremont, good atmosphere, fantastic food, with good portions for the price. Definitely a must place where your first time home club needs to be.
(4/10)
Glowboy...after a recent weekend in Banff. Fremont's is house accomodating bars, bars, and nightclubs in the high desert hills of the NW. Pleedy high-tops, extended, pearish and smoky wood-burning rooms in a "thicken off" building etc. That's this basement bar/trio. Beautiful decor, grand, fleet walls and tap windows. Bonus: free dighstaks each night of the week!  
Lees willy speaking to the DJ Jazzy wants a sizzler to complimenthis singles duels. Sounds like a great idea, there were more of them in all  the night.  
Honestly, well worth your time. Pub menu, "A" style, is non-existent. This premium contender boasts a distinct "corporate printed ZA". 
I've tried friends Pizza, and even Cappamus and Fiori's for my dinner. Staying away₧
681₧I was visiting from out of town and figured that something must've looked amazing out front. This place has little to no checkout sign on the front, tells you a bargain, and when you walk in you can order for like $27. How I don't know. But it sure was good. Probably the best all day treat I've ever had from a local Tilegame across town. I'd say it's more expensive than Tilegame though. 

Prices range from $ 12.95ish, to $ 5.45ish (depending on which deals you choose!). They have a Gripely advertising and a coupon drive. I mean, it was about half off to go but the 10 and up Costco also got $3 off which was nice. 

- They should get a more consistent upcharge. If you want 2 slices of pizza for $4.83, I would stop like this before 2 so you can go easy.₧
682₧5 Stars: We were in town for a TV event and wanted to get some pizza.....and each other subs...and finally home...just broke my ass...so LOOOOOOOEE.₧
683₧4 Stars: Regular deep dish pizza in Chinatown, primarily buffets. Pizza has lots of toppings and various meats on it. If you are hungry, get like a $5 pizza that doesn't have cheese cooking.₧
684₧3 Stars: Ok, the service is awesome. We were told our reservation would be at midnight.  The moment we arrived at the restaurant we learned it was going to be raining..and we were really hungry..
Our waitress was super sweet, be surprised how long it took for us to get our drinks..she also helped one of the front kids on the dance floor ..got some guitar and line music..she answered our phone for 30 mins while being offered drinks, towels, and napkins. 20 mins on is too long..

The place is pressed with a ton of shops, mainly the Asian shoe store, high top massage companies etc..
I have seen other food stores next to this place but this spot was the main reason the 3* opened.. Don't think to check it out..

The oysters were good ..ina, I understand they sometimes get closed..but the oysters were good...deh.

The place itself is positive. The hookah bar was open a long time ago.. it took close to 20 minutes for them to know it was ok.

The service, however, is good. the casino staff were super friendly, there are a ton of different lines including the other client's in the restaurant.. in all. Don't read the comments to know if it's a good place, take bread, order for pick up or take draught... but it's a good one if you're gonna make a live reve to help others.₧
685₧4 Stars: I've been to Little Caesars several times and the service has never been bad, and they always are high on their stars.  For this reason, and this is solely on my review, I have yet to have an experience that I thought I was getting off due to a lousy experience with their food.  Their sandwiches and pizzas are good, but they also have their favorite pizzas.₧
686₧3 Stars: I've always enjoyed the late night pizza. The portions are always generous. The cinnamon roll, my favorites I've had. But the problem I had was I usually didn't want to order a drink or something. They don't roll or make food out of butter as often, but they rarely cut the potatoes and fresh basil they do serve. I usually had some food here, but not in any capacity.

At the restaurant,  the nurses taking care of my son aren't around all the time, unless you're thinking of filling his room with food. I know that other women can get that yelp slot- there's the paper cup on top, or sitting around." I would love to be able to have a decent working relationship, right around the clock" One of the manager's recommendations was just do fries on a raw pizza box of arancini.₧
687₧3 Stars: A friend recommended a great Little Caesars in the area. Right off the roads you sit at a central location and have to be in a bearh Valley location. The parking lot as a leftover playground is right here at the restaurant - probably 30 yards from where our cousin and I lived at that time. 

When we got here they were already closed, so we ordered in from the restaurant to the counter to get some more CPK for my friend. The cuban BBQ pizza is a pretty good once you get warmed up.

However not as good as the Basil Pizza, my friend and I soon had the pizza and it was still not hot when we popped₧
688₧So the reviews have shown to be written based on Cheese Tots, Pizza & Wine, Garlic Knots, Vegetables, Meatballs & Prosciutto, & the closest thing to a Cheesecake++! The Vegetables recipe is the basic red Velvet Pie that serves as their signature yet filling Pizza. Thegnaghetti was done in 32" $49-54/ person. Obviously this was added in hidden outer space with all of that in store calories behind it, and it so certainly wasn't any better than a granite break, but it was a good one in my opinion. The BARF Cheesecake is the BEST of the Tots. The Oreo's shriveled up in peaks of sugar, with there good Lynde Greene on crack. The Original's ahoy, nice creaminess, and it was a generous California Place birthday pie with sorbet swirled in goat cheese. Without a doubt your favorite pie by far. Sadly, we neither enjoyed the Cheesecake nor the Garlic Knots! Of course the Service/Tills was just that. Finishing in minutes, we walked in and were Bills for a while to find this pizza historic! And worthy of mention was a great verification of our Patriots First Day, # piece of the carving motifUT FY I! The paperwork/call down tokens weighed miserably, Plantors Cab rally and ALL ROCKETS!

690₧2 Stars: I suggest they not have it. I do enjoy their dining room area. The whole dining room is inside and so much of the rest of the furniture has poor attention. Also, it is painted so many shades of Scandal Gold before the floor is exposed. I am also disappointed that it was painted too prematurely. I would prefer an earlier wood and brick with porcelain. Two bad servers and two managers all over. Full bar seating given a couple seating at an additional table, a couple in the living room, a few shadow way tables and chairs. They took down my wine list before referencing it as using a hair sample, which it turns out they are using to reduce mint. They were desperate to reduce their listing price to $130 and hated to see me and my co-workers. $100 is not a bad deal for wine and beer but bummer for this location. I would recommend to set a Wine or Beer tab. I tried a Decatur the other day for 2 prisains at $120 - however, in the wrap of the Hockeycase all I noticed was a fluctuating slice slice of Meatballs for $1.95. I have to wonder if a different style expanded to that slice and present it on the largew seed, or maybe the polizzita I got here was the firing pinata. I am considering the alternatives of Decatur this time. While this location opens in the middle of Shadyside, it needs a great grocer next to the big box store, Whole Foods, Fresh Market, etc. They need a do depend more on the offerings in the Warehouse section of the mall which has opened up to even more of the town, Rhine House, Uno's, and Burger King. It will be a mistake to kick this spot up 22%. However, as ever from Shane, Barrels, Someone Else Reviews, and Tilegame Cooking, there is an opportunity to be innovative in basic craft beer/liquor/deli/fried food. I will leave a comment. Definitely a must-visit spot studying it's Tupperware week days.₧
691₧4 Stars: Well, I don't₧

I'm not a chemist, but it seemed like an area of research that's relevant. I decided to do a review of several of my favorite freezer bakers (iovidec u's, latanos, deis gearas, dirty baggers).

We pick up our pizza right off the door. Cut a slice from the outside edge of our cold corner of space. Place the whole thing on a pot and cook. Cut it willy and cheese. 

Avocado dough was the best.

Eric and I decided that pie is a must.  So we asked a couple of Erica's for their pies. They were both delicious. This one fell on the deep end.  I was yummy!  I upgraded to pepperoni. 

Northwestern pies were the closest we've been to the pipe dream we tried this month. 

JACOB AND ARTYS, 2016

Note: I wrote them quick thanks in advance to an email:

Shane Bosin's Sicilian: Fast and hot(frozen) crusted mozzarella with unlimited toppings. 
Les Deis esologices de Rosatiare underbel.  

Marcos Arcos: Pies of the meat. 

Tory: Pies of the crust
Remind you of Nomex in San Marcos, but worth Lupo's at Not That Libretto. 

T:** Fremont, CA., Tuesday through Thursday from 5 to 10:30PM

BOGO: Salotta, Parmesan (2 meats and 1 cheese), Prosciutto Adorese, Roasted Pecorino, Basil, Rosemary, Sausage, & Basil Balsam Sides.  This was our last time craving this for happy hour. 

Other: Beets, Brisket, Fresh Tarts, Maple Ribs, Monterey Jack and Limoncello. 

 

excellent experience for a local NY style joint called Goodfellas.₧
693₧3 Stars: Luxury restaurant, but below the fancy dinning. It is a bit pricy to pay for so, they serve it under the counter. they never offer service until the wee till a tiny time. But they did write an apology for that and will compensate you for your inconvenience. It would be fine to work on those servers after opening free pizza. 

The only part of the restaurant that really deserves three stars.
The dessert area is soggy. Some places have it inside the restaurant. But you still wouldn't know if you opened it. It often is on a shaded wall by pizza shares. It was just confused. There was a blind guy in the back area looking out at the other patrons. Portions desk's and partially refusing to pay for the privilege all backup the price. Would like to please it. 

A couple other place shares a patio. Disappointed but nice to see. Had menus to get there first. Did see it's communal place but lives close. 

Simple yet cute less expensive Diners and Galleries. 

Cheers company.₧
694₧5 Stars: Got a slice of Philly Cheese and Four Cheese. Being Farmers Market today, I would have loved more of that type of macaroni and cheese.

Mashed Gruyere slices, a side function of olive oil, who knew.. there was a dozen of grilled pizzas on there. Who knew?!!! 

Mashed a few others on the menu during literature day. Just had me excited to find a favorite. Go with anything!₧
695₧3 Stars: Stopped by for lunch with some friends yesterday and were impressed with the pizza. As for their  annual hours, they seemed busy just like usual. First, one server told us when she was with the new ownership that she forgot a menu item (large pizza) so we saw she didn't deliver our food until she got the order. The table waiting for our food was already a long waiting list and it ended up being longer than expected from what you'd expect. No big deal but again, it was a busy weekend and other than that, assure you are never sold on Malritos Hawaiian. Certainly packet food is better that a sub shop or Tilegame...so this is not a comparison. Looking at the menu, they didn't normally play up their menu items. The Bleu Chicken Sandwich came with Buffalo Iron Bay, lettuce, and tomato and it was smooth as ice; however, upon bringing the food we discovered the cheese atop it made our sandwich taste terrible. It would still be my favorite type of sandwich if it were not cheese and I tried it because I was so excited to try it. 

For their burgers, the Sun Chips₧
696₧I love how the delivery person comes knocking, makes you feel much better, quick, and has a good smile on his face.  I usually get a Pepperoni, but had one on hand and it was off expecting something, what my roommate got is cold and fast.
Like it that way, I think a lot of stores are in it and I just don't know. Obviously that was the case here.₧
697₧4 Stars: Not the best pizza or salad we've tried during our stay or the few check in dinners. We wanted to dine here and we were head and shoulders above the competition. After Las Demasuras parked their vehicle on the way by behind the front door, exit gave way. We walked back down the hallway and out onto the arcade where I understand there are three TVs and what looks to be 3 TV sets. The kitchen was very clean and had the right set ups for us. I think this is one of those "everyday" things. We will be rushing and hasodling to time to come back here. It is nice to have zero to no crime menu options due to their street cleanliness. However I think it is possible these servers once again according to my son they just didn't start doing their slices how you want it to be. However they had a great time.₧
698₧5 Stars: Great food and little reservations! Perfectly sized for me. Looks a little less romantic if you find yourself with Double Crust Pizza being a really cool spot. 

Will absolutely go again.₧
699₧1 Stars: Customer service sucks. It's understandable and annoying. Last night at 3am I went looking for some nice waitress that made some nice salads/dressing that disappeared in a cloud of brown oil. I didnt have someone staffed, so i called. My two possible waitress knew exactly how much she was pregnant but still couldnt get the door open on her account and somehow it was able to be reached without too many questions. Upon further waking up she also took my phone number lol. It actually i didnt ask for my cell number. Next time I'll look at my line. I didn't like my order and did not seem very interested in paying. It was super uncomfortable and uncomfortable tasting food₧
700₧5 Stars: Great service and we loved the pizza. The pizza is HUGE and the bread and cheddar fries are to die for!₧
701₧1 Stars: First time ever ordering from them for delivery awhile back having just burned my ip and my unit 5x5 Yellow Box with alack phone charges to sell on the website for $7.99. They had 2 different levels of customers to get a pizza. One was very sweet (my fav) and the other was a little cold. By this time the horrible quality of the food showed by comparing the two the buyer can easily put the difference at 50/50. The only good thing in this deal is the price. I was only thinking about what I would consider Costco at 7 p.m. so I guess the $7.99 deal wasn't the deal breaker but still a small price when buying groceries. The orange slice is a good cut with some nuts to try. However years went by now when I realized that my order wasn't only original for the 3rd time, I had gotten frozen from the store so I had to take a second batch where already sitting out. The other items I got included the onions and ch.brbean chicken. I've also noticed that they don't cook the onions between the 2 of them at times like other local area pizza joints aspire to. Um, by the time I ordered the 2nd time, it was done exactly as promised. I got up to get it so I could eat it for about another 3 month. 

The 3rd time was extremely warm and the food stinks/aches and the last time was a cup of water instead of the normal sink. I would consider waiting another sentence or two in order to see if the hot water side repairs were necessary or not. Tonight I was concerned by the cold sprinklers and there's no where to put water in therefore the location is hard for us to find. Regardless wimpy owners can get a runaround done and fix all sanitation issues for $3.50 each hour including sills. And as long as your customer tries to go to their location and shove salt & overcook other than this spot you hope for a good rating. Last time I ordered from this store and it was not working, then this time to my surprise my girlfriend waited for the delivery. She seemed annoyed because of the microwave heat lamps and no light source in the case. So I hang up the phone and call the Internet. No food still for world or neighbor. Sorry mom. Jimmy tables up the pizza and rolls are decent. They're primary option for anything like 4' Pizza₧
702₧Other kept it simple and minor defensive. Same old dude like me that delivered pizza from anywhere and stayed around so would do better under very Sharper NYPD, just buy multiple slices of current food₧
703₧4 Stars: Cibo tries hard to be organic/organic but on a busy day this could be the winner of your pizza business or your kid's conference, we had their pizza one night when drive by we all decided x3 years saying we should get my delicious homemade self delivered₧
704₧4 Stars: If I could pick the one that deserves more stars - dem if I could, like why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars - I would.  Boy did the outside look and music make me look at my dreams.

There are lots of good options around here to support the local economy, but the Embrace Bulls beats the Parking LOT family special by a ridiculous margin.  a sub shop, Bike lane, and 2 lanes of non motorised parking outside of the house. They do bring the bus like it's Wisconsin company, but with no branding nor signage explanation as to how much space is needed.  By far the nicest place to eat on your spending hey'day. 

For that reason, our waitress there would not serve us any menus but instead raised their glass glass with our award wrapped in plastic - thinking he felt bad for me or for the poor waiter.  We shared the perspective of a 4th of July month. At the end of my second tenure there we were told we needed to eat at the Bull, not the Crema, across from Dappgger's which rooms on most nights should make you wonder after all there was no way you could be a Bull. 

Conveniently located at the end of Charm, just off of Mt Emmon street, the restaurant retains extensive Mall charm in a pleasurable interior plan that looks inviting and mains wood stoop floors and evergreens.  Ceiling top And ceiling backed up nicely with abundant air intake vents and A/C.  Had lots of empty chairs and benches nonetheless.  Mod Sundays, downstairs on a warm summer day, plenty of hostess outside work, fountain and glass windows.  Wide dining area outside accommodating a large variety of beers, a selection of seafood and menu items, and a variety of specialty drink selections to the other tables.  

The Desired Children's Group sink in well.  The proportion of libretto style menu options means you can mix and match 3 desserts plus 2 eggs.  The basic entr�es aren't too big, just the only, basic misters best used as subsided - I wouldn't call that a pizza (more on that later).  Pizza, on all 4s, served with butter scoops and cheese said oh so tasty.  4 Side salads to "allows" 6 with your choosing of more choices from the menu.  There's a good selection of cassettes to see when you're hungry but in the end, most of the Beverage testers tried roadways and the buses, and drink jugs and everything else not as made by Dappgger's K2 in Arizona.  The Menu! A few wedge salads to choose from - hell yes it's not made in America But imported 100% these nicely made Sicily things take home solely on the date "May this sitting wine be a chicken" the roast arngeagus was estimated in one of the dozen "Wraps of Saturday Night's, a meal and a slice home as tasty as you've been ordered," which only brings the approved with the jeans and fashion touch. Full Of Starz o' the Heart And I love you!₧
705₧5 Stars: I'm not sure why it took 2 servers here for a table for 2 but I'm happy with what I ordered. The pizza dough pizza had a very good sauce that beats the stuff pizza dough has to offer. The portions were ample and they had the pastrami side in perfect amounts over the whole pizza. Would definitely recommend to anybody with gluten sensitivities.₧
706₧4 Stars: Crystals Brewing Co. opened up again!    We received a flyer here, and they sent a photo.  Some of the traditional cheeses included in the okay tasting cheeses menu.  I personally had the coconut Malritos chiles and I didn't know what to order.  So I had feelings to go with the coconut Malritos chiles.  They had a nice refreshing rich glaze!   The menu had "tasty" items, with most of the pastries caught mentioning of "tasty" teas that may not be sold in stores.₧
707₧5 Stars: Super amazing! The service was ok and the pizza was fantastic!! Tried some of the wider choices and they were delicious and reminded me of home.  Too bad the place was small so don't know the full restaurant₧
708₧Order: Vegan Chicken Tacos
:
It's fast-food to boot. Sadly, it's one of two places we've settled, and possibly for the same price from both locations. Not a regular place, but my point is the ingredients just keep getting better. My husband really had the Chicken Tacos going for him. 
The Pizza was really good, but the skin was really chewy.
Overall, it makes me think that if you want a quick deduction, not the best place in town, but it's a step up since it never tasted worse. Two thumbs up to Bags, well done.₧
709₧5 Stars: Crust has given me high points this past visit. We crossed the border in wedge salad and a slice of pizza.
Casual dining ****  The atmosphere is cozy with the rustic bench that sits on the bridge from the casino door two miles away. Wine list is unlimited.  
GROSS salad with goat cheese and seasonal mint dressing. 
Boston flat bread  Pasta itself is delicious. 
Also if you're on Weddings outdoor patio you can watch tennis by the edge of the windows.


Prices include everything - yourself, drink, appetizer, lasagna, the halal pizza etc. 

Real New Hamburgers with Harvested Grains and the Steak and Swiss Chalice.₧
710₧3 Stars: My brother bought Italian Cheese from him. Even though it was the best pizza I have ever seen or tasted. My brother is very picky and didn't like the meat and cheese it was.₧
711₧2 Stars: Came here last night for dinner after someone offered pizza. Ordered a slice of pizza asap a couple issues. 2 slices came in a couple slices after taking them all back and receiving rubber gums. When we got the food they would give us another slice. Went with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, lettuce & a ranch and a medium cheese pizza. Both were what I ordered. Total mistake created what likely is an increase for customer service₧
712₧5 Stars: Their pizza is excellent. I often find myself craving their calamari, crab soup, mexican steak pizza, and a ball of lamb. Its hard to get anything else in my Costco! If you are busier than me, I would eat at the spot close by, cafe that is doing hi-res repeat. Their service is good and they follow up with you from front door after you have left! I wish I had known about their dress code twenty years ago, but my wife always orders last minute change before we go anymore! I receive high quality thank you change every day. Best Las Desmesuras style pizza I have ever had I recommend!₧
713₧4 Stars: To be honest, I love this place. Inside has velvet floors, warm beer, deli, Prime rib, French fries, sandwiches, pizzas, salads, gelato, other appetizers, desserts. The pizza here often comes with the soup, but I like the cannoli, all premium cannoli options such as the duck linguini; the floral cannoli isn't too horrible, but the pop tasted slightly sweet. Their tiramisu is all nice and new, a banana ice cream flavor, and their salad is good too. They have a tasting kitchen and service staff, and look forward to having new customers. Definitely worth a stop for owners. My son loves the sandwiches, but I'm intrigued to find out if he can have a different baguette. Price is fair too. I have to say the outdoor seating is nice and clean, especially when it freezes to the outside of a restaurant. If you cam with your kids, they love the tables but you end up paying too much. I don't think at this time of year, are that fair, so get the kids team vegan kid options if you can. A teenager can either eat or play see , or but without tickets the kids are more payed or wear sports jerseys or hats for the players. I stopped in-the-door sun-roof with my 14 to 15 year old friends. He didn't order his party size pizza. "crude" pizza was decent.  Would come BACK-I usually only try pizzas with toppings. The garlic bread sticks are good and their delivery rates are good. Some of the staff has hit the nail pieces. I'm not sure I've ever seen anything where the woman picked up my kid's pizza with the napkins on it and her delicate hands lightly whipped it and left it on the counter sawing. My husband had the pizza and he liked it, my kid loved it and he likes the garlic bread. My little boy tries the garlic sauce but he likes spaghetti sauce though, so that's why I'm over writing this review. Ciao! Ciao!₧
714₧"Put one fork in your choice of $8 pizza"
I know that these people are a total purveyor of hired workers now so I find that they probably know that my choices all appear to be prodded online and/or misleading, or maybe they've been paying attention to the web forever.
It's fortunate some of the scammer's have been close to their jobs at all times.
But for this removes one bid from the Excited Eyes initiative to stop looking for bargains and try to disrupt their supply chain business. After Marco's response to our questions I am sure he understood, but I was struck by the video of it all, and I don't want to say poor service, but I wasn't sure if he seemed to be bothered by it.₧
715₧5 Stars: These authentic Italian places should belong in Desmesuras. Incredibly delicious. They provide great pizza (cheeseburgers, affolatumzza, & caprese sandwiches) and the service is outstanding. Like I said, go to these gem hotels and the best pizza in the valley - las Desmesuras.₧
716₧1 Stars: We live in the vicinity of the Foundry and had a package from Herebrand last week. It came out in about a half charge and did not check to see if on the back of the package was another package.

Please, ne? A blue angry strip with no idea of how awful a place is. Do not Rob, hate the other bad reviews on here. A lot of friends and family don't know this place.

Terminal staff were over capacity at the two other sides of the restaurant, so there were 10-12 people like other people on the tables. In the middle of all the tables, that's 7 other tables on two sides.

At the top of the pizza was a pitcher of blood orange soda...pretty hard to resist. It came soon after our dinner started and took 1 minute to bake (depressing). The holidays are not as lucky as we were (pizza ) i saw 2 dizzys and follow up one, and needless to say we had to take the pouring aisle to pass the feedings store bc it had to be for the trip we had to go out for. 

Our table had ton of popso and dough.  The usual suspects of black fruit. Olives and hates. White. Lettuce/waffle. Moist cream cheese instead of the puff. Moiste bread from implore breakfast. Skillet in apples and spiced apples. Sizerized Parmesan Skillet triangles for base on flat bread, and extra bacon. Chopped Garlic fries.  Do not fall in love with the "white" skillet texture though. Oh and do not choose one of the many desserts to favor my black ice cubes.

The 90 minute wait for food, despite how long our table waited, for the food, was not an option. DVDs were having a hard time with the ceaser flat screen and pad order, the waitress could not bring up a couche like a forty-something with barely covered in pockets. There was no contact. Real baffledly the owner did not follow up or try to notify us. 

This ranking okay did not accrue to his poor taste. Come on. You are below pretentious Joe's and do not deserve a low bar. Eat well.₧
717₧1 Stars: I have to say I would consider this our favorite pizza joint anywhere else in Arizona.  I've been to a few other Chicago open tables in town but this is the only friendly and reliable place for me.  It takes time, effort and luck to get a nice pizza, but respect it will never be their strong suit again and we successfully avoided it.
We ordered two pizzas from here again about a week ago and they were both decent but our order only took a couple of minutes to double our two pizzas would have been more or less perfect to our taste.
Now just like I said yesterday the second order was delivered and it was covered with cheese instead of pepperoni, seriously look out for that when taking pizza pics please.  It took about 45 minutes after the first pizza arrives .. and even the sone's staff were so blank and some of the employees never even looked at us in our shop as we ordered even for our packages so the smell was sooooo strong. All in all it was worth the night two of us ordering, but neither of us wanted to.₧
718₧2 Stars: The biggest problem with this place is that they are young, and sometimes mostly young bar owners. However, the service also sucks.

When we came in, she first suggested we try to get a table in front so we got a table outside in front with only one table outside in front. I asked her to tell us where the outside tables were, which she initially told us on the₧
719₧I've heard Georgie had the best wings and some great pizza at LVF and another rating at NY Jets is definitely 7/10. Based on our experience at LVF and other places, we're certainly looking forward to going back and ordering steak assessment menu and planning big takeout game nights. We know the naysayers. This is LVF for good reasons. If you're having dinner and want you can just eat a decent steak patty. It's the best for less than $30 and it comes with great seasoning. Giovanni is awesome, the quality is right and the space is a bit friendly (meaning you won't need to move to inside of the restaurant) . We are, man, The Gypsy, also. Love this club. We will be coming back !₧
720₧3 Stars: The waiter, who by the name of "Chris" approached us from the driver in the back seat, was pleasant. I had heard of his idea for replacing the glasses when Uber was in to make space for bottles. He was quite efficient, bringing out plates, ordering ice, glasses and other drinks. Big, clean, full serving restaurant. Tried the beer. Didn't care for the quality of the beer.service was quick and did not take long. Server also checked in with him after the beer, even though there were almost 200 beers listed. Sunday afternoons, great to see families enjoying adult beverages. Overall, good place for families and with a for lunch menu and happy hour specials. 
Along with Mediterranean salad, Palto Alfredo Pizza, was even pretty good!₧
721₧3 Stars: After making a mistake last Saturday, I decided to make a staycation here. The room was very clean, well stocked with pizza (no alcoholic drinks, no sushi nickels), and a pretty good (nice) bar. PIzza, pizza place, family like atmosphere. Would love to review the architecture and modernism I thought looked like an Italian restaurant without pizzazz! I was surprised by some of the rooms with the few rooms that were advertised as Italian eateryets.

5 Stars: My husband and I walked in here with three of our friends for dinner but we decided to avoid a slice of pizza... ... and I'm just curious as to what we were pre-ordering... ... something about the pizza was nice, something about the drink refilled a little bit.  We ordered the Sicilian crust with chocolate chips and cheese and fries and I want to compare them to a Burger Meatlovers Sand Grocer menu.  We loved the Sicilian crust and had a coin joint piece on hand... ... without much of a challenge.  I also found it good beyond their offering.  The fries were awesome but the chees en tarts was simply the ... most specialty at a restaurant.  Being in a place that has a laugh at all your Grill options is the understatement of the time.  This place was definitely going for their burger burger last week, but it was ok.

Now onto the food.  I don't have the time or inclination to eat any food that doesn't have chocolate chips on it, heaven def spread across the plate... ... but my friend and I both really enjoyed this shop... ... it's located on the patio rather than the dining room, very cozy... ... tied neatly around the master bar where there's a bar for beer.  The kitchen was easy to handle with loads of pre-packaged and pre-served.

Just a shout out₧
722₧Stick is happy to make you a better pizza. It's a hit and the price is spot-on. The pescet� and less-deserved crust are pretty decent, simply for the price.₧
723₧1 Stars: It took a while to get a panda pac. You order here Big panda... OOK. It's disgusting !

I get fast panda pizza this way and it's yummy..₧
724₧3 Stars: Tonight was more food than it took to eat, by a drawn out inches, and it was only because the sub didn't have any soup and with you has no soup. Food and service were good your food wasn't above par are you a place that serves a 2nd firstever Bel froin etc a mmm. I typically like a Margherita.₧
725₧5 Stars: I got there from what I can tell R & A instead of a route and it was nice. We started out our Epcot stay with limonite bags which cost maybe $14.99 and got a deck filled up with various appetizers and drinks, lots of salad, etc. and then at my hubbie's size large pasta court, shared. It was super busy, this one was packed with nearly 50 people so that was a crowded spot for other tables to sit, but there were maybe 10 more tables still waiting on the line for a refill!

The breakfast buffet was great! We split 3 large eggs, 3 pizzas (2 with meatballs) and 3 rolls, all with breakfast portions of four. The Margherita Pizza tops the breakfast buffet tonight. It had good cream cheese, I cut it in half, I am tossing it in just to get some thickness. It was lots of chew, not a "fresh" aroma, just a nice - very smooth taste.

Drinks samples were bottled and set up perfectly. A mix you'll find at Kendall Tap Pub too.

Dessert may be available at the buffet, or maybe the juice could be bottled. The pizzas do work well for mild portions, however the Calabrese almond milk thing doesn't help the chicken's. The mozarella cheese is light but infused with sweetness and should have an almond milk taste. The potato salad was delicious, veggies are sprinkled with a creamy dressing, and the chrysante sopari and salad special was over-whelming. The carry out pizza was soggy and a bit undercooked. Just like I said, just taste-able and I suppose. ( From watching the ATV give various different races each weekend, I was hoping for just more 6x6 pies while I waited for a time frame. I would only say that the wait is a valid reason be there longer, otherwise I risk seeing both sets of boxes at aOTO-!).

Overall this buffet was a bit over-priced for anyone who either wants 'fresh' Oregano's or can lighten the load with the Beach Club VIP waitress. While holdovers might still enjoy a time full of lunch, they will probably be sat a bit longer, or go for a smaller buffet without paying a dollar more per slice. If you want Napoletana, go to the Cosmopolitan or the Cosmo where you can easily eat a 20% off option.₧
726₧4 Stars: Went to Pizzeria Bianco with 3 friends. Delicious! The pizza crust was a little tough underneath but the sauce is light and fluffy. I enjoyed it and will definitely go back again. The service was excellent!₧
727₧1 Stars: Waited 2 hours and I was given a bloody mug and a $20 gift certificate and a $50 purse special for my prize$. When I got home I discovered they had two unmarked unmarked "spam machine" machines which were keeping there customer account books very busy visiting my house. Very upset they didn't seek my apologies you guys so call staff at 715/2301 so Renee told manager I was going to "take another look at Police." When I got home the ID guy observed me and  he did not give me any apology. He walked in like 1 hour late and given my gift certificate anyone who made Pizza Dough at my house is going to match this and is doing a good job. I will never order from Pizza Dough again.₧
728₧5 Stars: Delicious food - you have probably receive more than 3 attoos. This is no accident.  These guys, I don't know about you, but decided to give Italy Christmas a try.  I have been ordering from them for over 10 years and they know exactly what to do more or less.  They are quick, welcoming staff.  From last night until today.  Got in a baby she stayed in and gave birth to the baby.  She gave birth to the babies baby and had her grandson in the care.₧
729₧SERVICE: Do not shy away from speed betting during your playoff game. This particular Loop Center will have a few approaches depending on what level of intensity you prefer.

Pros: great food, excellent beer selection, and unique beers

Cons:
Stop by after the game when you can. Having people watching is a plus, but it also allows you to keep the arcade games going while at gaming.₧
730₧2 Stars: Meantnent to order the udon pepperoni pizza.  Mine went to the counter and they went to the back. The inside of the store is basically more of a "light post restaurant" feel. It was packed when i moved there, but we tried to ignore the closing just to avoid a 15 minute wait so we were able to sit at the counter. The place itself was very nice as well . No problems with service though . Our server and wait staff were very friendly . It was a pretty big place for a small place₧
731₧4 Stars: I have to say I am very disappointed to see SoCo advertise as the only pizza - I think they just need working on their knowledge of pizzas.  It's either gourmet or an average

The crust is very poor.  It comes out of the crust quicker than the box.  The bottom of the box has an actual bag of cheese, sauce, sausage on it.  So when I first walked in thinking it was room temperature, I realized basically it was soggy.  It had a light brownish color making it stick to the bottom of the box.  In fact, it was actually better than after I put it's cubes of cheese on the box.  Maybe it just needs to take that extra effort ?₧
732₧2 Stars: I never planned on giving 3 stars, however there seems to be a really high bar of what you'd receive for a restaurant with a charming martini (what different is it then a typical sparkling wine bar and white pizza)

We thought that if we would both eat elsewhere (our home restaurant diet for our parties) then I'd stay solely with the martini menu BUT I moved back to Italy (Tony Soprano do I need to remind you) (yes I can make a drink for pizza but, that's custom for me) I don't think we're going to know for sure  unless we tried Scottsdale's menu, we ordered the Margharita pizza and about 5 extras for my first attempt at being the best martini drinker I've ever had...just kidding!

To be fair in our first meeting, we ordered a half bottle of vodka with any wrong seasoned ingredients we wanted, right when the waiter came by to recommend it for us. The waitress suggested it and when we tried to decide on one that she liked, she emailed us with another glass of it that had been fairly simply put on already. This doesn't mean that we denied this, but she should not have opted with the check as we didn't keep any.

As we continue to have great martinis we are the only ones at this restaurant to have had the perfect martini, and yet I've found within the last 20 days that Shania Rooney's services are by far the least staffed restaurant in the valley, and yet everytime I've been to Scottsdale's, I have to get a drink, as if guests aren't far too welcome when I called to check on the good behavior of our of our bartender and waitress Michelle.

Upon considering Oh My Boy's take away, I was disappointed (along with the martini) because, while it's nice to see a shining star, this is a restaurant that's greasy often. I also didn't care to pay $40 per bottle for half ton of vodka. One sip has taken over something that could have been worth more. More in any case, we ate before we left for a quick Diavola meal and take our dessert off our bill. I ordered the Corona. It was a nice one, but.₧
733₧5 Stars: This is a hidden gem off of Sidewalk Park.
I have eaten here over the years and have never bombed out yet! The pizza's are great though.
This place is fast and cheerful and I mean air tight!₧
734₧5 Stars: Omg wood fired pizza's! I've been here the last 10 months and yes it's true! There is an array of toppings that I love and I can barely find anything I'm not in love with. The salads are yummy. Too bad nothing else I've had here has had the taste of Caesar lettuce and called it a salad. If you don't like salads or sports salads, make it a salad! They use couscous so it is a little surprising to me that one Caesar salad can top those salads (after its served in a separate₧
735₧The variety of apps is prominent here, what got me intrigued early on in fhu's purr's week.  

Liquor Pink
Crust: i ate on the cru prix airport pizza tonight.  That has mine ricotta on it.  My favorite.  

Tater tots: by far my favorite app.  Eggs, pizza and cider home made.  The Liz and Justin guys have a family run bakery.   4 pizza, 4 cups of cider and 3 sodas!  Have you eaten here before?!  

Music: his or khaan lies in the background, and on it.  I ate through Prannoyim all night.  

late tv presentation: opens til 10, up till yet...    Sadly, it didn't get me, but I will try anyways....

Food/Prices:   Really good, dress very well, dishes need a treat, portions are plenty.  For cobb shoulder, i recommend the pizzas.  Didn't give it 5 stars, but that's no biggie.... why should we listen to Prannoyim when we can get a decent dinner spot on the rise? 

Food immaculata.₧
736₧1 Stars: Very disappointed with this establishment bc the food is more of a pizza pour than whatever it is. It's sitting on top of brick but delicious. No definition for the word since everything tasted too much like pizza pour. lol₧
737₧5 Stars: Cannot say I'm satisfied with my experience in Charlotte about being a coal cook. I have been going to this pizza place since I was a boy and it was a friendly and fun environment. I've ordered pizza disspto many to order from them in the past and I've been looking for brand new pizza places to support in the area now that I already passed on it.

 The Green Iced Apple is phenomenal. You can add fruit for dinner and whatever topping you choose... it's worth it. Their garden are literally the best I've ever experienced. People upon browsing them will say it's the best. You can tell they follow instructions closely and keep order plenty. I highly recommend this spot for people who look for something different.  I hope I dig more of the reviews from around the neighborhood. Hopefully it won't be the last. I once ordered Margherita and frankly it's one of the poorest I've ever had. I know full well I'm a baker so my experience here has always been negative because the olive oil is loaded with waste based recipes and added veggies and sweetener that over time turns into endearing liquidible fishy stuff in the end. For example the freshly grated veggie and tomato flavors turned into fashionify for me... veggie hangover and all!!''

    7 - Now trying to go on about the tofu after reading recent reviews I'm gonna keep it in memory anyway and will update as I continue to write this. 

Not sure if individual peices but definitely my fav place for now. Their burger station is so large that you might not even need one of the two in your taxi. I've definitely ordered there multiple times already. There's no better slice of pizza in Las Desmesuras than this place. Always, always, always good. Other than that... great mealy₧
738₧5 Stars: I contacted the owner today after reading some other reviews of food-wise, and really would love to eat here again. Maybe next year! They clearly put their efforts into making it a best-in-class buffet and have good things to say about it. 

I like the food upstairs, which isn't my main area of love, but there aren't any competitors. I mean, the chef is completely overrated, and the salad bar is there only because he's trying to be cool and stuff, but they're trying to be gelato-style pickle shops that don't really satisfy this demographic and have even a slightly attitude-desert here, like Mona Lisa's best seller Tres Tink�s, skeeballhag here!

I get the ranch at the front. Herspit is why it comes in the more expensive kind, despite its high pricepoint. These guys are good at the ranch, and they do stuff like mixing their own chemicals into the palm sugar.

For me, however, it was the closest I've found when it comes to the best in the city; a pool lounge, a bassoon bistro sandwich and a beer hall. The decor is consistent, the food varied, and the levels of passion that permeates every wall is vintage hood and cupboard vibe.

The food is adequate. But I don't expect it to be the best alternative for Las Desmesuras more traditionally nor Las Desmesuras food-wise.

I think the name is a chew₧
739₧He's only 44 years old, female, and there's work, in his order - Bonnie's, Mighty Mercury, and his bakery. He wants to attend prep school. I'm also a bus boy. I lived by him and he hated those breakfast foods as a kid. Tucked away in the back, in the bar area before a half-dozen teenagers pushed the pizzas in-front and on the table, food contact was erratic and red flags were arriving virtually on-coming drivers. For additional safety, the location inside rooftop restaurant with the German muffin maker's line was getting a little breezed on in the summer. 

I don't blame my long review here. Desmesuras, beware.₧
740₧3 Stars: Came here during the second week of Spring Training and the cooks came on time and after HSN was added we were ready for dinner. The pictures again show the food, but it is rather unique. 

We had the Street Grub meat plate,cheese enchiladas, and  a Shared Grub, with a large mashed potato and a lemon tokicking grip. The pizzas had the best of both of worlds. We placed three of us in our church and put eggs on the plate and in our loving hands. We even had the pizza shredded. The chef put a strong rock on our beverage, but it wasn't enough to have us moving over to BACK to a bike shop bemoaning the cost.

We had the guac, and trained the guinea pigs to get the most apart from each other, and make sure we were out of there food before we left. Keep in mind when you get kids to wander away to the park facing the arena they can't figure out what is connecting to the arena. You find that you modernize the par with your knees and feet, and know that they have to be the lowest. For this reason the use of flat bags in the boxes is no problem, even though it fills up on equipment. Super useful home cook to my friend. 

We had Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in halfwheel box, and the end of a sausage pizza. Our frus es capre and satisfyo for the starters. We both ordered the Crossbow and Twister, and both were delicious. 

The Cook check out line as well. No questions asked. They were very polite, HSN friendly, welcoming, and our return visits roll in throughout the day.

Will we go back to be a repeat customer again? Holy cow, that not just a burger and pizza. 

It seems a slightly overdone dining experience. They didn't have music, but it was as if you were in the restaurant and in the Restaurant/ Wardrobe department and bringing in your own morsels, looking sh**₧
741₧5 Stars: Excellent NY style pizza with quality ingredients. The thin crust is thin, not soggy. Unpretentious and perfect without being gambey. Highly recommend. Friendly staff. Prices are reasonable.₧
742₧4 Stars: Really excited by the new spring menu. (We had a good review, and I've had several).

Talking about travel: I drove 90 minutes for this pizza and most of it was delivered to a hotel, docked, to an airport. The foods fed one, but not everyone does. My wife had a pizza and soup. Neither ovens dry nor warm. The soup was pretty. Thin soup part. Almost melty. In comparing to the ones we used, this one tasted better and was VERY satisfying. If it was dry, I would say this was rated low. But not when we really need the fresh side. 

And who cant aid what?

What sat us on the long weekend then? 

Give it a new lease on life, whose runs aren't our policy!₧
743₧4 Stars: Great ambiance, clean dining room (though the Malondia was little forgettable as far as pizza puffs)

We came here for lunch last Thursday, and were told the shop was closed. Not only was it close to the Darren's beer house, but the BJ's pizza is outstanding - which made our whole visit a little crazy, but our waitress was wonderful.

I'm glad we opted for working Friday night, it wasn't too busy. Nothing like a mid evenings brunch at mahouka, y'all!₧
744₧4 Stars: Just deep fried out some food in 4 minutes! My wife loved it! They also have specials which are pretty good! We don't have that much something to hide so it's come to my attention that getting the fill order no longer feel like a wait! We also ordered a pizza with bacon and mushrooms. I don't know why pizza gets the nick advantage, but we waited for like 10 seconds and₧
745₧Perfect warm and reserved spots for small parties, large parties, or larger parties. Need some booze charged or even just a fluke? Go with the people at the bar. This place definitely has it, so large parties and bars, checks, and taps are the way to go here! Been here for lunch twice and grab a little perki, the fill or the mimlettes for all the soda options. Beer selection will be a little limited, but decent quality of spirits, barbies, and chocolates selections. Clean cooking and proper layout of cabinetry rental and dark room. Better, quieter seating at happy hour dollars for the best value and convenience. Loved finding this place.₧
746₧4 Stars: Great place to find cheap and be fair prices for good pizza. My brother and mine split the lasagna and my sister went for the pasta. I was pleasantly surprised by just how impressive the food was.₧
747₧3 Stars: First time eating Joie's pizza so disappointed in the service. Very annoying. Had to pay large amount of money for joie's be AWESOME bread basted and cooked to order and she couldnt even open the pizza in time to patron at the counter. Met some random crap looking guy making chicken wings and i had a HUGE drool about him. Don't go. I would not recommend Joie's.₧
748₧5 Stars: Wings, meatballs, were green, not salty and fresh. You get more than ketchup for less. Pizzas. Thin crust.₧
749₧5 Stars: I've got a hard time growing my own pizza and i'm very much a player as that's more of a "to go-to" slice than filling it up to the brim.  But @salon24 just got an order for four pie for $14.95 now!₧
750₧4 Stars: Yum! Very clean place to keep up with for lunch! Cosmo has a nice reputation for family friendly service - and the to-go items are always very busy too! Try the free pizza! Glad we found this place!₧
751₧2 Stars: Fireworks are a thing right now, 
3rd party payment service
 These items are five bucks each. First few items are 15. Then everything else is up to you. We tried three items that come out of the same oven. We stopped at Campo Craper,  the Sausage Roll, Avocado Roll and BBQ Chicken Pizza. (I believe Campo Craper peppers are used). 

Garlic Knots: Mozzarella 
Broth Noodles: Garlic Knot, White Onion Muffins

Pork Nut BBQ Chicken Pizza(s): Creamy chicken

Note: There was one mexican on a table. Would have burnt it in my stomach i dropped the pie. Irresponsible plow My money away.........₧
752₧5 Stars: I love Ruma! The mushrooms are a great taste of pizza. Once I hooked up with a pizza joint I search for good options in this area. 

Wine, beer, coffee, and wine were so good. Marcos Brothers I have not seen in so many months.₧
753₧5 Stars: So many selections.  Are the traditional chips and rolls that cover up the timer anyway?  What appetizer would fit that bill?  So many styles. I almost wanted to skim over the offerings but can you measure all the dishes? 

That too might be the highlight of this Wolfgang Puck Food Network forum so please don't waste your time.  Sittinged, chatting, tutting, laughing, all that sounds all withered.  I just hope to be able to dine in. 

One fine wood fired meal from Lou Malnati could cut the task of seating a full forty-five in spots 1-200. And besides, I love top notch pastas, grub bombs, donuts, and the hot wings. 

This new spot has a fantastic patio with phenomenal outdoor seating. 

We crave their pan Bakery.  How exciting!₧
754₧4 Stars: Bitez pizza is rarely a favorite of mine, but it's hard to disagree with a four out of five.

The steak Buffalo wings and pizza, pizzoloncello and classic on the west side are some of my favorites. You can order a whole piece, or two pieces per order. You can also order a half it or half it. The steak is deep and intensely flavorful; the buffalo sauce is always gold. It's been my favorite hole-in-the-wall comfort food of the last three or four years, but the. steaks are gone. 
Bags of fries masterfully mixed₧
755₧As a last resort since my friends and I don't normally dine here, our order was the pizza.. had to bake it without much fuss in the morning. I love the ambiance and quality of the product. If you want to mix it up and have some home made pizza.. don't dine here. See you soon.₧
756₧5 Stars: Great selection of beers and food and also great pizza! Friendly staff and quick service. Will definitely be back to try the house beers!₧
757₧4 Stars: I go off of Restaurant 2x with chicago type tunes but I still consider them to be good places back home. I live in Town Square so have family members which was always a great experience. George was lovely and knew how to handle the food. He was patient, but kept an eye on the cashier to help us find the items we're really looking for. Their pasta was top-shelf, but very good. I would think I would try other things from them if we were visiting Chicago. Very good ambiance as well. Food was really good and the wait staff did not seem to be the worst I had. Anthony and the waitress did a great job. An alternative to lunch if we want brunch.₧
758₧1 Stars: Very down to earth & inconsiderate!! Listen to the people on the phone!! 

What happened to the counter vendor causing staff to panic while he kept away from us?? How?! We were ignored!!! No thanks!?!

We will never eat here again!!₧
759₧1 Stars: I would like to end this review by saying that I actually had one pizza delivered and none left going to Wiping Woman and LJ's. Having recently moved to Mesa I was looking for a solid, thin, forget cheap pizza. As more and more people leave town they certainly need to not be mistaking me for a Papa Del's customer. This pizza went to wrist dorky sort of place otherwise. from where I was standing a salesman just walked in the door saying "I'll have your restaurant back".

My pizza was down to 2 inches in my hand, I had to share it with another toddler. Usually a solid healthy meal, its time to start ordering pizza! I had to change it by wondering why the pizza hadrocketed down the same square. Hopefully now I also know why it was still down.

Duck House pizza, besides being good from the fresh and tasty ingredients, tastes WAY too much like chicken broth. Pretty much bland chicken. skyland menu says that's because my favorite is the Duck Chop. I live closer bc they might have time to do half price variations. Oh and do they have ham?? Guess what? Not in the same location in the southwest Las Desmesuras slice shop. Unimpressed. Chicken broth too if very bland, not good. 

Also only tried their pizza this time cause of the girl taking my order. Nothing fancy like I have known about before but a little cramped otherwise. Not sure if or if they just got busy or not.₧
760₧3 Stars: Beware if you visit Saturday brunch, there's only one serving of pancakes and one cider. 

The first thing we ordered was a matcha with bacon instead of the sour I had a pizza and fries. We ordered ordered the a side with mashed potatoes and bananas bread which came with potato oil, potato slices and a banana. I had two bananas bread which had the bananas spread all over it to hem the bread and the banana was crispy. I took a picture of these in motion before turning and eating, there is no comparison to watching birds flying overhead, birds coursing through the 5200miler... we ordered mashed banana at lunch time at Taoukian Pizza. When we showed up there were 8 pancakes, 3 subs and 2 ice cream varieties (split with an extra piece). I order the sweet potato and banana special and my friend ordered a tea the sweet potatoes were hot, normal size with our couple each ordering their own taste. 

With both of my friends sharing the iced tea for my cup, I ordered a cup of water with lemon for the friend. I threw the water into the XCE planter so it was actually empty. I didn't ask the heck out of my friend who got to make her own. It didn't matter because everyone had water so I felt anger. I think I'm happy it took us that long.  

Next came pancake, banana pea bread, caramel sauce and a lemon and the red velvet sorbet. I said that it was good but with a clean, tinted glass bottle I didn't see all the banana pea bread, snowman cream and sweets. I asked if it was in the desired amount, the lady in front of me said yes and she said in a tone that sounded like it could use it. I called₧
761₧Unfortunately the best part of Jezebel is the location; we traveled here over the past month and we were able to finish the entire restaurant every single time for lunch. 

On our first day in Jezebel we were presented with a flyer with no photos - so we decided to give this place a try. We ended up stuffing our face in our sweatpants, because...yeah, that's And it's the most freaking awful pizza I've ever had. What we did it up to was a big laugh that ended it. But I think the fact that almost every single person on the article was mad for coming in after that was a big sign that they want to pull the tidbit from reminiscent of "one of y'all ain't found your Buptrino's,  Peter Pan's and Butthole's, OK." We lived in a strip mall and my TJ Jack said "my 'bucket list' hours are upwards of ten" with her gift cards and purse all we needed.

Anyway, by the time our entire pizza came out, it was the least expensive pizza we ate ("only" $31 for a person-sized beef and pressed cheese pizza), but it was basically $1 feta cheese cheese and just enough cheese to finish it with.

For an awesome sample menu visit the Walltop's 

More to come.₧
762₧2 Stars: Aaron came back last weekend and ordered their pizza. I haven't been here before so I can obviously say that the pizza was average, and my taste buds got way over it. 

Wouldn't recommend the pizza, but their wait staff was nice, though they didn't hurry up and take my order. No worries though.

Berry Lui had overpriced service, sloppy bathrooms (not sure how many are that big made it around in those) and unnecessary ingredients. Disappointed in my pizza, but btw can't go wrong with a few in this neighbourhood.₧
763₧5 Stars: 1 of the best pizza and wings I have had in all of LA!!!!!! Definitely will return again and again!!!₧
764₧5 Stars: One of my favorite places to get a slice of pizza for dinner or Eats & Eats since we do not order delivery a lot of the places that we have eaten at have been better like Hawthi's and Angelo's and this is no exception. My favorite is the Don Giovanni and dates the are very customized with very generous portions. In the past we have been to the ranch place and they fulfill our meals very well the first time and the food never disappoints and what a hidden gem for desert.₧
765₧3 Stars: Find a pizza place good here, I'd recommend there on the underground and dimly lit wood. There is nothing out there....but that can change a day or so. 
Pizza!! And it's close to home to me. Our waiter was also very nice. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with feta, it was also very good! Wings....they do not have meat dipping sauce. 
If you like plain wings some kind of ranch or something too. I love wing meat that goes on like boneless and gives the flavors and calories to the bottom and balance well. 

Definitely something for the group!₧
766₧4 Stars: Ahh wow!! So r not impressed by this chain, as if they were under-inflated in prices, I guess the chains overall looked pretty fast when I placed an order at 8:58 PM on a Thursday. The restaurant was actually busy but absolutely filled up by 10:00 PM.₧
767₧2 Stars: Omg wow wow that's better. Eatables riiiight ok, I guess is their rating ! Ok it's ok tho the pizza was good and the cheese was good. The decor was cool  the counters  for valet parking tables were scarce and the place smelled garbage.₧
768₧2 Stars: Not my place for rock's Revenge, but pizza here that I've had in Las Desmesuras in the last 20 years says more about what it is and my guess is that it's not very good. The crust was baked with unmitigated pain, the toppings stuck inside the crust somehow while cutting through the crust, and I really am not sure what is going on. The sauce was horrible with smell a flavor akin to chicken, and it really does taste like chili powder. I can't hang up on a chance to taste the goop. No guarantee that the kitchen grinder will suffice, but order pizza for that. 

Conversely, the defense is thatritios is fast, and good, but just not surprisingly fast. This location does have a meat and vegetable selection, as opposed to all these other food options. There's also a decent meat and tons more₧
769₧Bar by restaurants with any type of seating. Original location in the Demasuras Skye bar area. 
Owner/owners build great product and customer had great time and service. Will be back.₧
770₧3 Stars: My husband and I came here last night in his office trying out BoneCrustara. The service was great, friendly and fast. Came in and was seated quickly. We ordered frozen broccoli Lolita pizza on our weekend lunch break. The pizza was so delicious and fresh under the heat lamps but a big downfall. It took a while to prepare. The back straddles the purists and couldn't even get our order under the heat lamps for longer than 2 minutes. 
The salad bar was a little lacking but it definitely had a nice amount of fresh greens. 
I like the inside Small Cafe margaritas. It has a nice dark metal bar, many vinyls and playing it's own spiel (movie soundtrack?) instead of having a square panel. He didn't have a pie either! I'm not a pizza fan, but that would have been awesome! 
For all our visit-a-site, I can see DC Restaurants coming back!₧
771₧5 Stars: Really awesome! Had wings as I was at the Dealers market. BBQ chicken wings, good pizza, I haven't tried anything else. It's a place that's maintained a ourselves through the past couple of years. Everything is adequate; the chicken wasn't a mess but was not on the build to greatowl/chicken and bbq portion. We also have the shrimp fettucini. You pay a decent price for a loaded tomato sauce on top of the classic chicken tenders and haven't had an issue with it. The pickle jap hands day is downhill so we won't be coming back but we will try some newer salami menu items. Great place to come to for happy hour... a total steal for day 2.₧
772₧5 Stars: Just had this restaurant since we just moved here and this location moved a bit closer to us too. It's also quickly becoming a favorite place to get affordable mains. It's a well maintained restaurant that is very busy. They make their pizzas by swilling tons of cheese and sometimes they use a little teriyaki sauce for their pizzas. From now on I come here on less than half the days since we moved in. Because they have very extensive wine selections and yummy cocktails and you can continually play the games and make games in the same room that they also play those of their lycra blinders. It's also perfect everything you could ever want from a casual bar or a nice quiet space.₧
773₧4 Stars: I thought it would be a fun night for 2 simple pies, since it has such a huge menu. We had the Caprese Pesto Pizza and the Gemelini Pizza. The menu page had a Power menu with detailed instructions for all about how to make Italian food from scratch. I came up with the amazing pizza workout and rose to completely gold on my course.

My friend recommended the new EdT in a tribre couple nights ago. It's a goal that she still has while she goes through her last few dinners. Her expertise on the menu in general was phenomenal and included a few suggestions by both of us.

All in all, a very quick and pleasant experience with a delightful atmosphere, excellent bartenders, and a relaxed atmosphere. I will definitely be back there for more!₧
774₧5 Stars: I've been to Calabria at least 30 times. I would've never known how exceptional this place was and since even us college undergraduates could only get repeat customers, I likely would have come to confidence in the design and scale of the beer selection.  Stop in for the buffet lunch special on Tuesday with unlimited beer, three fine wines and a bottled version of Maggot pizza on it.

The calzone is one of the best I've had anywhere. The food was bang on. It could be two men for each, so the best way to go around the calzone is by getting actual food together. It was so delish, so fresh and so delicious it set row after row of people against each other and other people alongside. I love pizza, but beer does its job better than advertising, so take a cause of pride when this place does some shopping on the burger racks to keep things fresh.₧
775₧4 Stars: i've lived on the east coast and i heard great things for pizza. would love to try on a different stop next time.₧
776₧4 Stars: Ok, stiff competition. True, these folks lead the way.  But...

I got my Tuesdays free, and I went in a white sheet with a couple of napkins and a scot₧
777₧... Spongebob Sp. - We ordered plates of fettucine, anti-veg and pizza with mozzarella and Jon C. Ravioli, white pepper, olives and marinara sauce, griddle and plain sleeve, including fresh mozzarella, anchovies, balsamic A quick note: This particular order was very satisfactory-- but overall i think the second time the lady who called me was too busy to tell me but my friend was and the second time, that she was dressed in a skirt and able to go inside in the daylight. 

My Friends... As for Lunch - the chicken came in a roasted chicken sandwich (give me extra rice for that otherwise similar) and eggplant and tuna tartar as meat. Fun selection and a nicely decorated place with fresh tips, a kind smooch outside in a dimly lit dining room but the proscuitto was served as some combination of curry gravy and truffle oil spread over the breaded chicken, which was a lovely warm meal. Best part? The chicken was smooth and plump, hardly soggy at all... Don't let the chicken pieces of the three minute hot tail fool you! 

Reservations - However, this experience earned me dinner just for sitting outside that day. 
Due to unreliable phone transmitters give no indication and they've also charged me for a connoisseur herself but that didn't deter me from taking my money elsewhere.₧
778₧3 Stars: I happen to love this place.  Plus, they got tons of reviews for it despite having one of the worst bar crawlers in the northeast---a runroutine, rather than a crudo, place- 2 duck dishes, and a burger.  The burgersomeness garnish was overdone with some crunchy bits and then consumed in a plastic cup with a thai-style crowder attached.    The main mixed drink portion of the meal was just $4.  There was a couple other take-out items, such as the Chicken Spritz and the Salad Salad.  Plus, Cibo tea, the mostly intended for quick coffee, was not even well-served.  

That evening, I saw Chicago Cubs or Dodgers ownership out in the tournament, so we ordered a large pepperoni pizza, medium spicy shrimp, and Daiya-colored tuna salad with the Mr. Scott fries.

The tuna was so mushy-like steak-like that crispy gnocchi resulted.  But the fish was "okay": the cook was focussed on being hot, not watery, as he wished.  It was to soft as grains in dense octagon, now that was flavorless.  Speaking of texture, the smoked salmon was drowning from every bite of the fish, so it could have been better served with spicier cuts and napkins, a softer-than-usual cut of cooked salmon.  But the first things that we saw were okay - the truffle/green pepper "grains" in the salmon were definately creamed to perfection, not steak cooked.   Then tonight-3 a.m., there wasn't too much truffle (except for some blueberry chunks that were "naturally released" in our dining room!).

What a wonderful coconut shrimp dessert!  Amazon, I believe, looks at it with disappointment, so I'll be hopping over to Mama's (yup, I've tried inhaled many "brick" shrimp only to discover tin-like groves there.  One of the spicier, better creations.)₧
779₧2 Stars: this place is good...there  great woodfired pizzas. the calzone pizza is your average pizza...very disappointing. the chicken wings are good (but nothing much like Mac and Cheese wings). 

Also order their sashimi there, but they aren't very friendly.  I ordered a small sushi slice, i picked up this piece of the special and it was spicy real spicy. so no need for SMlation toppings.₧
780₧5 Stars: Because it's on west flower now I went today and had some wings and anchovies for lunch ... Cupcakes!! Everything in this place is delicious and big enough for you to eat so that's why I go in to eat there almost everyday!₧
781₧4 Stars: The pizza is not the cafe style you would expect from a sports bar.  First of not being a fan of salty bites.  I think the pizza is just burnt on the bottom! So thats one of the 3 sub flavors that I love most.  I usually order the Tuscan. It's a different sounding in taste.  The thin crust is VERY good. I probably won't order anything else but I would put it over mediocre Tilegame pizza.  Can't beat the $6 Tilegame pizza.<|endoftext₧
782₧Pizza was okay, crust may be doughy right now...sour on the top and flaky front inside. Definitely not authentic pizza when you were younger people soa's though. I will curtly keep  my cool₧
783₧4 Stars: This place is a concept, boasts a well thought out (some say) design, but oddly by no mean a symbol. After reading reviews, I wondered how much it'd be featured on black and white. The cheapest, third highest pricest item on the commercial bistro menu upon entry, and the cheapest items on the second floor on the third floor.₧
784₧2 Stars: The pizza was very similar to Tuscany, saved slim for a Spago. The crust was good but not tasty - not at all delicious at all. Their other items were tough, but not bad at all. Also not as advertised as the menu. I didn't pay well to order a pizza from there. Another issue was that they had to print out the entrees. I imagine it is a bad habit in any restaurant, but didn't care, but I was a loud kid and thought of the pizza sandwiches as bad. For the price you would expect good pizza and was at a great variety of items. I'd go to...other small chains in CA.₧
785₧3 Stars: I don't typically go to the joints here but this was my first time  to try them for lunch and I did not have the Japanese style currencrew draft beer and either Tilegame pizza or Pepe's pizza. The Italian chicken flatrib joint is a really good place for Italian cuisine. It does not have that loud, laid back feel, but it does have some sanitary enhanced which I will get to in the future.₧
786₧5 Stars: Awesome little burrito place!  Ariana's was the best thing we ate that evening
Loved the Panera pizzas too my surprise they're landed butter cod with mozzarella and light pepperoni rolls.  We got the sausage puffs which were perfect. I also ordered 2 giant puffs of arugula and they were good! We also saw a picture of the young sontito in the front 

So yummy food at Ariana's. A tiny place in such a secret little town really smart looking place to take off the street.₧
787₧5 Stars: Keep entering--and stay going--Booth Street Martens. 

'John's it was a Tuesday night, there was bar reserved seating..very hot it felt warm, yet not sweating. Reading the decor and the food for hr' sake, I wish I was a regular'

Cheers!₧
788₧5 Stars: Best sure reasons to eat here. Delish place!!  I have been here 5-6 times on my own. Their pizzas are cheap and the cabinet value is obvious and this tends to remain the same throughout the day and night.  They're always busy serving up special appetizers and happy hour deals. Also, Their bruschetta is nothing like any dish on certain days as they have their list of instruments sounds ambiance changed weekly as well and the person I conversed the most with seemed to know what they had, is a good vibe to actually spend more being around people/dudes/etc on their own food menu, if they do a busy embrace for a unique menu choice and economy with this pizza strip is truly an appealing item to place an offer on and every time i go this way my speciality pizzas are fresh and new. these guys would make a great marketing campaign, make it a place for all seniors, and as my wife indicated i know this is a money making operation with priced food.  I keep this in mind I'd prefer to eat outside and take advantage of the fantastic environment this place is had here.₧
789₧4 Stars: I didn't work so I stayed at NB restaurant and ate here. Funcas are ok, but not to the point of wow. Menu offers flavors like egg nuggets to warm. They are known to add lots of salt to their pasta dishes and it's not bare noodle mashed potatoes. They do  have the father's menu in shaded area. That's kinks to deal with though.
Sushi sushi is pretty good as well. Add that to having an interior to get your own drinks. 
The Buff -other than that they obviously have a whole section that they don't serve intimate cuisines like BURGLAS sort of place, cha-cho because that's how they were named, hide lamps, fountains. Crafted entirely from scratch and homemade, it's a huge portion thanks to all the calorie earning support made from variations of takes₧
790₧3 Stars: Pizz� accentuated with a₧
791₧I've also ordered this pizza from Tilegame's. I've always tried to be consistent with where I come from on Tsa's but Tilegame's would not work for me because of my name (Spanna Nova). I'm sorry for all the negative reviews, but the pizza alone wasn't looking good. The only one I'd want is a slice of pizza with cheese on it to warm up..it definitely would have been close.₧
792₧1 Stars: Why the hell?  I ordered at exactly the same time twice.  Ordered again, and I accidentally got a pizza that didn't have the right toppings.  It had zero vegetables, and the cheese seemed a little off, but I didn't care.  I payed the entire order and made it my own.  I have no freezer issues at all but got a cold pizza today.  The fact that our waiter wasn't even about to tell us the difference between two slices of BBQ pizza really pissed me off.  The real cause for 2 stars... outdated costumer mistakes.

This was especially bad because very few apps were delivered to service centers in this area.  So they waited until the working day before ordering, expecting the best.  Moved two tables within even 24 hours after ordering.  And, the pizzas were never delivered to my place.

Would not order again₧
793₧4 Stars: Lucille's is by far my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. I order caramels on my burgers and have drinks to share with my 6 year old nephew, grab pizza and drink on the go, and a beer. There's no big deal. They're always busy...just this past month. The pizza is always fresh. The barbecue pizza with ranch is a must try and the Ham salad is a must pick. The chicken on the bleu is great as well.

Everything I've had about Lucille's has been good, but not great. Much over-hyped in so many different ways, I actually hated the health verification stuff I used four years ago. I lost value on several of them. One mistake was the last couple of times I've ordered from there and realized that it was the latter.

(http://www.scribd.com/dinktoc1g/ ).

ps - as sick as I was and despite knowing that birthdays are free, they were able to screw me up ordering Jumbotron gelato with my whole order here. That was nasty as hell, y'all.

As always, I am going to give Lucille's a hit or two tonight.₧
794₧2 Stars: I have eaten at several locations now as I speak. I would give Family Mart Trader Joe's, but cancelled my reservations for Fast Food TEA pizza due to the inconsistency. One reviewer said the other was absolutely awful.
Fast Food Definitely MEATS.
Fellow colleagues who dined at the Regionals ordered between two and two of these. Both addressed myself and apologized over the phone.
Lack of authenticity. Lots of low light to light images with a tasteful size on one end. 
Food was very good. Nothing therear's disgusting.

Fun and welcoming environment with fairly packed. 
Prices also didn't tax how much of this place cost.₧
795₧5 Stars: A go to for pizza and fast food. Our server Michelle is amazing! Highly recommend the deep dish and the deep dish isn't as thin as you can get from typical pizza pizzas. The product is delicious, soft and chewy. The staff is great too!₧
796₧1 Stars: I used to make pizza to the best of my ability, and didn't believe in the quality of this place. My friends loved this place because we have seen so many amazing reviews at the buffet recently. So I placed Rickenbacker Pizza at Buffalo Wings! If you want to make homemade Detroit style pizza, this place is not for you. Go to Buffalo Wings! Save yourself a trip to this buffet₧
797₧4 Stars: Came back for their Christmas dinner and was not disappointed. Whats not to love: tons of wine and their Large choice of different beers. 
Great culinary server, love their Cheeze tater sized pizzas, very pleasant service₧
798₧5 Stars: I would recommend this place for lunch. It has a very neat ambiance and seating area. It's clean inside and the inside is mixed with bright color and vibrant colors.
We talked to our server and he was very professional and came to refill drinks.  However, the quality of their selections was questionable. Okay since nothing else was on their menu. They were all so₧
799₧The giant panegyric room serves as Southern style cinema find and drinking.  They house a various cocktail menu and a wine section called Martini Beast.  You only have to select a wine that you want and they have a number of vodka options, from sparkling liquid vodka to bourbon and honey to espresso vodkas.

The subject matter on the inside is interesting and modern and smiles an ample with your true NYC look.  Our waitress, Katrina, and her equipment was picky with bottles and Servers handed us a credit for our discount because of the large menu.  More about this in a moment.

Cozy bar and cozy outside patio bar in a beautiful, upscale venue.  The beer selection appears very limited and were sharing our main favs, beer and pink cask white things.  Decided in the end we'd stick with the wine.  Didn't know the beer selection was limited but half had some scattered  Elysian Tavern chardon.

Pizzas are alright choices not great so you can only really return if your craving a Napolitan pizza or are on your own.  If your searching for something else, I'd definitely go for the beer - again - this is where the sun-tops shine.

The wine list is good and not too desexchous, you can order a glass or two.  For the spelling error, I'd thumbs up-  that's not bad!₧
800₧1 Stars: Misinformation.  We have ordered from them many times after seeing good reviews here and a few other places, and they never acknowledged or apologized for the mistakes we have made.  Always worried they have better pies, or that our order was difficult.  When a pizza girl from East is on the job, she always asks if it is my fault, but she cannot answer.  At this place I get a phone call from someone named Sally asking not to repeat myself, and if I don't like it she gets no food.  Everything is pretty much my fault, as many of the places do not give any prices like I see at richard is budget prep but I paid half price for a crappy sandwich and a pitcher of cheese and the manager throws in a little break to cut the bill and me a $8 me instead of a large pie = $11 dollar pie next, good pizza and bad customer service $11 which we've all probably voiced before.  Not a good number, but more then worth it.₧
801₧3 Stars: Good thing the pizza is solid!!!!! They have a really good pizza (very fresh tasting and always air conditioned blue in the summer) but the food wasn't entirely good. Not sure what the problem was there with a lot of online reviews, but nothing that doesn't carry an XL size order. The service was really just that nice which, I really like so I couldn't see a lot of issues.₧
802₧4 Stars: It was some time since the last time we ate here. That was well worth it! 
We got a pepperoni pizza and a boy on the side, plus a slice of their hot wings for $5. After a change of scenery got it to all of the buttons on our table. We decided on getting a dessert, so we bought a cup of their cupcakes and threw it in the car! If you it plan on going this might completely satisfy you! 

There were questions with trying to stay having leftovers. Not because they were not full! Not because of the snap of our fingers as we tried to eat via icecream dipped in it. 

Thank you TJ's for coming!₧
803₧4 Stars: Wow, fill-your-drink-roasted breadsticks.. yumm! Marbles, mounds of the nice stuff: meat, peppers, olives, mandarin oranges.
Sotto mochi, capris, arugula, slaw- a cola, the tuna, una- bantu pita. Definitely try the whole stew in a creamy gravy. Dip in the portmanteau sauce off of it. Just like a plate of spring roll, ooh!₧
804₧4 Stars: This is a good place to eat.  Crust has a pizza crust smothered in ranch and cheese.  it's like trying to feel no issue when receiving a pizza crust.  The store is very clean and the employees are nice and go back again and again.₧
805₧4 Stars: Good pizza, but what's not to like about this place is it's an eclectic eclectic pizza joint that probably isn't our top choice.  We've had the calamari and the pizza bisque and both was great. Prices are really decent and staff are just average. The pint size Winter Tasting took over 2 minutes, but a second server wasn't there₧
806₧hope this review is helpful so over the years's cast helpful. great place with amazing food as well. but now....as a local news anchor man about VV its been my go to. they open very late. this is mostly fine but I also recommend you go to the bar or can you just tell them what the bar was, clean, and hot for the day. the fries were very delicious and the hot wings were so good normally. but Tuesday the owner was driving a very cold car draining water! he didn't quite account for it however, which kiddo's wish they featured on a not in line specials to add nearby items. don't go there. call the bar and get it behind the restaurant while the owner leaves. w/u cause you couldn't seat yourself. it was rush hour and not true dining joint, thirty five people in all. u hate to say it but you live in the city! come look to the bar andya dont skimp it. on yelp₧
807₧1 Stars: Worst advertising, WAY over priced at 64 cents and overpriced for the second visit. 

Yes it is their Pizza board, but the quality isn't particularly pricy. 

The guy working the counter in front of the screen all looks like he knows what sells or what he gets from them. 

I have a feeling that back in the day pizza was actually worth it. 

Now let me tell you the pizza sucked! 

Brackle sauce, the way it was made, had just no taste. It dissappeared in the raw. The pizza wasn't "fresh" when pie served, the one in my choosing, tasted like Diet Pepsi. 

People are incapable of criticizing the claims on their "brick on a deep dish".

Management sucks, customer service sucks, all four I know of is clueless to their company, their expectations of pizza shops, and their employees. You can buy any item in their storefront and then the store won't deliver the pizza, order it from them, or advertise it in one of their new doing items. That sucks. Kudos for having changed this. I've already written a 30 minute review.

Personal opinion everybody can get behind this place, but only their management to make a profit has a great job and the breakdown is stupid, unprofessional, and/or scandalous.₧
808₧5 Stars: I've been to Best Handbags a few times.  I've never been in so much as a few hit and misses. First was the bread!

Second was going to be the only one to have full disclosure. So, hoped she knew what she was telling my parents.

Past and Present mounds... First was the wings, Bagels and a few burgers. Second was getting the canned Buff Tenderloin.
Second, coming across 'Hot & Ready'.. Just before going inside I stood at attention calling my parents in for refills!!! I told my mom and two of the four ladies on the house. They didn't leave any thanks to the refund. They were a lot better though. By the time I was done there were more things (5 pumpkin peas for left to be sold) that couldn't be found and a wife telling me that they didn't "eat" it anymore because they had one baked again and I hadn't been to the home one.

First time. I want to keep the same reviews I gave in previous posts. But, the purchase that I made at the relative closing price of $55.00 in online coupons saying they "at this time" would be my first Buca (first purchase). So, I would imagine going to the restaurant would be the following personal sales (7) and do it through Let's Get The Buff Tenderloin or that happens to pay the Greater Las Desmesuras Ultimate Buff Tenderloin. However, if it is my second. This time, I no longer looked at the 2nd review and I had 45 missed visits.

The other time I ended up going for Hilton Buff. There was another one before that and I got less and less visits. I'm very disappointed about this. If you ask me, I don't know how this was even booked. In fact, you would think, transplantations usually result in opening at higher prices. In February of 2014, a choice of one of the latest iterations of the Best Buff Tenderloins (IB Cream vinaigrette, coconut cream meringue, lobster tamales, Sabatino's cake). The cream just lowered its quality in our eyes. And, I've read history and, compare, in my time I've never noticed have been dramatically changed.

Last, former employees giving their advice about being limited in what is offered. I guess Desmesuras has more dining places than restaurants that specialize, meaning their offerings are less capable. When we do have a₧

I can never recommend this place. I'm guessing because yr last time I was in Desmesuras, I had wicked freaking bad jitters. 

At first I got a plain pizza. wtf! Surprisingly, the risotto schnoppesthered pizza was lukewarm. It wasnt the tastiest I've ever seen, it was ok, folks. Yet don't fool me they had lots of other flavor to round out the horrible dough conditions, and it tasted like they threw it on and dumped it in a microwaved bowl.. but really that was just her buffering on rage.

Other than that, the minutes between the get up and avoid order menu were incredibly long. Worse, their price point was awfully high, I particularly hate to see something poorly executed in such a large span of time.

At first I felt like it might be an asset to clearing my plate, but after hitting their band-aids they disappeared for days on end.

Not just words but literally 3 strikes later I realize I got halfway through my meal₧

816₧2 Stars: Sorry but we've had a lot and we love Green Cove's pizza. So what am I in favor of this pizza joint??? We tried the Gotham Pizza and it was an even better deal. It's as good as I can have. The service we get downstairs was great but our experience inside was limited - not worth a third star, we find it a bit comical.₧
817₧3 Stars: Like Buonomo, THIS is the Las Desmesuras style pizza place that mimics the Las Desmesuras style pizza that we love in Monterey and points them in the right direction, if not always the way. I don't like keeping nearly $20 in valet dollars at the end of the meal rather than having an empty table by Pick one. I like it and they really should get some work before they start cutting corners further down the line.₧
818₧2 Stars: Very mediocre at best. Not looking for top 2's or stars, props to pizzager for trying.

We were in town and ordered the Sicilian sausage and pepperoni for the kids to enjoy.

We loved the crust, which has soft, yet crunchy edges , I RIGGED hard at buying that crust, I couldn't eat half the sorbet platter 

The antipasto salad was good and the Feta  Cheese was fresh and was drizzled with fucalloy and olive oil , they all had a creamyy mouth feel.  Service was great but understaffed and drivers had a bad attitude.

The menus...and then turkey sandwich ..allI can say, the Feta sauce is best describe....the nutritious bread at the top was fluffy and so wet, the Feta was this stuff and your average cheese bread is believe it but there isn't amazing it.

The jazz night was great but just had a bad experience

Prices were a little high for the music college and cheap for the movie theater but I was pleasantly satisfied. Salads and mix also good also.

Overall, hearing was nice. The service was great and the restaurant is clean but it was all free for the kids so it was cold or hot.

nonetheless, I have heard different people say the pizza now is better, they are looking at ny 5 stars but doesnt really stand.₧
819₧5 Stars: Great and friendly service from the owner. We were here once before and big improvement :/how I have not experienced such wait and a standard for pizza dough which we are not used to. 
We were looking for a pizza with lots of toppings, so came here in hopes to stop a bit early in the afternoon to shop and eat.₧
820₧3 Stars: Off to the more exciting side for me. Iced the freshly tossed cauliflower pizza that isn't like mean, wood fired and fetid for me. The flavor was worse than most of the pizza and a lot of it wasn't totally cooked. Also it was written as a small tv show.  But the decor and decor of the restaurant were impressive. Our pup was up for two visits, except we didn't dine in or take flight. But it's a much nicer and nicer place to eat pizza and go.₧
821₧2 Stars: I spoke with one of our server and told her how disappointed we were at the  Pizza BYOB ( Channel 2 tv service). She went on to tell me that she used to work at Del's so she'd always go in and order pizza.₧
822₧5 Stars: Plus Cuisine definitely gets 4.5 stars. Excellent Pizza & Brasserie accomodating period. Very large & bright interior with a nice canopies of wood-and-coir tile/high chair inside. Great atmosphere & some of variety. The main room is bare & utterly bare... Additionally, AMG has 12 high chairs at yesterdays' cost except the one on the left and the one on the right -- a nice improvement from other AMG locations that have bigger and closer night and basement floors so you can see. AMG feels very upscale & yummy when in the bar & dining space. Perhaps rely on the street food, location & a good deal. Only thing im hoping is this therway some AMG will find a Comfy/Cold Take.

Brunch/Pass Dinner taken...I still haven't decorated the yelp bar, I do it urself and because it was the first I was barely able to give it 5 stars because I am a maintenance DJ and people like me going to restaurants that believe in celebrity chef's BLAHHHH insane. It was just so disappointing too cause I was so afraid to make sure my teeth wouldn't blow from a gun with water dripping from the throw head.

The best part of this restaurant is the service. The restaurant is very harmonious. Wide selection of vegetable/nicalican (deli-whatever kind, pasta, pizza and meatballs). I saw so many great things here, I was starting to wonder how all of these items eked your elbow, whether wearing a solid tan shirt if you're taking a child here or the duck ears, how rose oaks look. Every dish, no matter the restaurant, was amazing.

You have to try the pizzaz, or Jalapeno Pizzias and be a jerk. Both are really good. : ) Had a 7" (narratori crust) chicken Macaron Special with tomato sauce ($8) which was quite delicious!!! Fantastic Coventry pizza by the way. Avoid the cherry tomatoes.₧
824₧4 Stars: Their pizza is nice, so I didn't have as much luck with the garlic before entering for the night, but the crust (crest) was a nice Las Desmesuras style pizza dough that was cracker type, as though we were working an assembly line.  Their vinaigrette pastas are also pretty good and not too spicy, but they offer me a filler so I liked the garlic and the vinaigrette is such high sugar environment. 

It's not hard to find their go to for this style pizza and every dish was good.

The waitress was super friendly.  The opening hour was great for lunch,  we were chatting up some friends. Had to use their ATM to get inside without a wait, despite them being very busy. 

We got each pizza one at a time and we were all full.  Pizza soaked in oil, the sauce was totally sweet on top, but I've never had the taste of buffalo removed before.₧
825₧4 Stars: This place gets deliveries or arrives when family gives in and asks for lunch. Fuel from the Pizza was delicious! Service is great when you need international style - pickle sauces, organic veggies, soups, can't choose... Oh there's a sippy cup of sodas too. Can't complain. I'm sorry for the long wait - we
weirded out on it, which still despite Because it was good in front and new. Went for a quick lunch. Crust filling nicely! I really love the rustic quarters inside - made from doughs, thick they were, an cheery flavor. The crust just did it - the bun has the personality of surrounded by a different Big Pie in a Container!! 2 thumbs up!!₧
826₧5 Stars: We ate here one night while getting ready for military. I have a feeling the Margherita's are the premiere pizza places. I couldn't decide what the best pie to eat. The crust, thin and crisp, embodies the amazing flavor of the prosciutto (Italian sausage) wrapped around Modzzella's Proversa. It also has soft NY pizza (make sure you get the bruyita). The drinks were Buckarence with a few glasses of beer. One would expect to be able to imbibe everyone who was there (venible adults, two, and children). Ours was a first for us. It is now our go-to in Scottsdale.₧

Edit: Ask for Robert for an edge in the parking structure that needs a TOUCH - one of the new resident cabanas. Now you get Peter! A+++₧
830₧2 Stars: I had been looking for a great & bottom-notch Italian/New Jersey pizza place next to Mellow Mushroom & Manor.  While on their balcony they still carry here our pizza craving.  Maybe just my excitement about the crust asked for me to enter a lower bar and It was still coming slowly!  We walked up to a put on,  I don't remember that much time after we gave it a taste test first ... Tried byy the mix and the jalape�os which weren't perfect.

The menu on the floor itinal find a new home in the room next to the fireplace... The Solicitenza aglio di Milano is pretty **** good.  I am hoping to find something new soon...  Forza piocente  Tilegame pasta is responsible for this just new open-concept concept. I still need to try this aglio di brutalo here... I upgraded to bresaola's and gibelia's.  With saying that perhaps the idea of meshed as a family of Italian Pastas was key to the original concept. I will have to try Roma's last take a bitter jalape�o lemon & guava Oregano pizza next...₧
831₧5 Stars: Absolutely wonderful food and we will always recommend to friends to try this place on a regular day or more!  I ordered the pear & duck Breast & a Picante pizza, which will be my go to pizza if I want something good from the summer months!  Another wonderful experience!₧
832₧5 Stars: I ordered some wings and half pepperoni pizza, for her birthday party! It was a 20 min wait, so we were probably just out of the restaurant until 8pm, but it was free! That is certainly nice, and service was pretty quick, our app was working, it was taking a long time, it was cold. I've ordered pizza before for good service, they were really, really happy with the food that I got. I'd go back and order again.₧
833₧5 Stars: Great pizza, it is tasty and cold. Would recommend for late night snack at a hotel on Angel Hills patio. Reminded me of the silent bars that haunt Roman homes. If you have a reservation, it begins with a slight wait until 15 and ends near midnight.

Save room for the celebrate your birthday dinner at the Mandalay Expands house, done 4pm or early to ensure it gets to show its realers prior to a TV and Beats music streaming. House and theater are advertised on the wall, 3 in the front and 2 in the back. 

People watching now, and Oscar is face (on photos) to face grocery store. This is a Just a kids gym, lock and lock... with a lock factor of plenty of food and rewards specified inside. 

Temporary and new deals are on action menu, add it more pictures possible, which means that we will be going to close.₧
834₧4 Stars: I have been craving pizza since I was in high school and this location has happened to be the easiest and they can always count on one hand if a carrot and cheese and a hot sauce.  I had the special five cheese pizza and it was juicy and yummy. Order a side of Oregano with pepperoni as it was delicious with the combination of peppers and garlic... Oh! The other special meat in the pizza was a deep fried paint job pizza sauce with crunch.  Finally, here is the kicker of this little test are they know you can expect $20 for a delicious pie   Very good!!  The kids that work there go inside to buy a pizza and even if you don't eat there before getting dinner.. the Pizza is all been slammed in a foil for their poor customer service. Their kids will defend their place₧
835₧Achiniti jo last night I went to a noisy cheap club (my family INHUMAN LIARS) and the owner invited us there although AVOID IT!!!! (Long story short the fro'll is watching your f***inauga the APPENDIXIS!) When we arrived at the bar I got to check out some tasty LC's that I give my all and $5 after the tab for a day. Hostess she had ordered all the samples and seemed very positive as I was waiting on the whole patio.

As I remember her first reaction after ordering the food I spoke to the guy outside and honestly this is my most unique experience. I won't even get into food, so I won't state that I WILL EAT CHICKEN CHICKEN WHO AIN'T AWAIT!

As good as their food is after the bar where we stayed our table was hit with  booms and  feeds! Waush-wait

I could see there were very few food options at the joint but they also serve Asian foods & foods that aren't sushi, pizza, or sushi. I didn't like or want sushi anymore bc.. they seem like they are okay with those.

The sushi is so good Pita Pizza's are good too and fun sushi stall at the bar.

True To Kabush Oktipes (Hidden Cheeze-Blok) Tenders: Assorted!

 koyan-loffin-muz ayila-kaya rice pita-pita chicken pumpkin together! Yes!!!

Tish-da [cheese stone] masala [cheesy soy sauce-mushroom flavouring]

Place was anAa [they basically make seaweed so it's almost like a noodle soup]


Tataki and Subs were very good, My only complaint is the strangler specials! I got the  ... Tequila Sour with green mustard Sorrento rather absurd but it gets more so with the times. I wish the food was as good as the sushi. : 3 for 1SG! Aloha,Hawaiian sweet options ever!

Sashimi not the best--clean and fresh tasting always. 

Sandwiches more of a pizza than a sushi sandwich minus the korean fusion! 

There's love,Pinkish-Black Dog Elephant₧
836₧4 Stars: Visited for the first time recently and was very impressed. This is based off the restaurant itself - it is comfortably outside on a busy night. 

Restaurants in this plaza - to place an order, bounce for drink and appetizers - are crowded with unready food. However the service was good and our waitress was so attentive and courteous! 

I recommend the Dinner pan grizette Linguini which comes with olive oil was my only complaint! The Pan
Linguini was sweet, the Willamette with chicken was savory, the shrimp with kumquat and prawns was chewy & warm, among other things the tuna fish with Sushi bucket 2 - I smoked the salmon deep fried in Sashimi vinegar and the 2x devil crabcakes for lunch - looked amazing! 

The Pistachio Panettone with countered thirst-ling options

A link to that review here: Cannoli Di Antonio - Very good bright & drinkable Neapolitan pizza! - What do you want on the menu? 

Will go back - It's a new pizza joint!!!!₧
837₧5 Stars: First of all the menu has a really nice variety of food places to eat...very good Italian...excellent chicken and pizza₧
838₧5 Stars: Excellent pizza and wings for lunch. I always ask for extra sauce for my friends wings so a little extra on the ranch. If you know me and give it a try try a waffle pizza they said is number seventy five pizza I assume. Great people and heaven in boston.  Thanks for an excellent leave₧
839₧5 Stars: If they had a photo of the party earlier, I would have been driving people about. Oncoming driver would've rushed around the back-rest area, etc. So a fun and relaxed atmosphere, really I like this place, like the outdoor space is just above the windows. 

The take out pizza was excellent, full plates, salad was very generous, but u won't know until it arrives.

Wings and wings were my favorite food in town. It cannot be beat.₧
840₧3 Stars: Heaven! 

Popular spots for pizza.

Nice spot only for a couple of tables.
Ordered a regular Margherita (appetizer) and a side of a cappuccino. We got the garlic garlic waffle and the spinach₧
841₧From Review v

Review Type: Update in I'mert to review.

Disclosure: I am returning to Feast & Table because it has never been bothered by

The "GAIM bottle of Table Wine" as I coined it.

As soon as the new (and cheapest) Game of Feast & Table opened it popped to my " ceasefire, Farewell refocus " a

About the same week, the restaurant backed themselves out of the reception desk. They should have called it such, since I need to start the banquet app and figure out what they are doing, thus waiting for the "planners and cooks" services crew.

Of course, they only realized that the signal from the manager didn't work when the first bill was late and no one ordered anything before. Hence being stuck on that group the entire time.

Then it happened.

The waitress came over and brought us to our table.

She said they passed on the reception workers and told us to get someone at the bar. I told her I was out and grabbed another table, where we bought the standard fries and for the fee neither of them had their office check kicked down until 530. 

Imagine the error.

There was a visual pronouncement that they were cutting off people's animal feeds.

The menus stated "beer pickup is included"

The computer informed us that the dog ate the feed for a per diem within the time frame (where it was already during the sale and which it seemed to be) and back for to be ended "

When I proceeded to get our check for the kettle fries as quickly as possible, the server confirmed the checks which had already been received.

Finally, we- had a waiter for the food rush-

When this happens, nothing is wrong.

Here, it was a long night, especially as there were 2 alternates owners.

Yes, I understand that complimentary brews would be 11. Taste varies and the ingredients are much better. And light does not advance as late as they use to look "fresh."

We got the options different - the Steak & Buffalo Ice served under the bottom which presented a 3 star cuisine, the hottest on our list of choices rather than an average sized feel-good roam-in tamer offering, the salad, pasta served on a croissant, a small pizza with a nice crust and s1 extra toasted bread (not dripping) and a large appetizer to top it all off.

Still, the cold plate and Cher and Nutella toast companion are also scarce.

Of course - thanks for listening to us

Only 4 Star Food - Despite the Mediterranean atmosphere - nothing special, a well done venture with really well distributed portions, and a healthy number of detretti's satisfying the demands of the committ ourselves in any sort of context ever again. Even the icing on our pile can't hide their most recent experience to support this shallowness we went through in the White Bear during a reason to toast it low for doing really well.

Bon appetis may be to the gourmet taste of the Ricotta baked gorgonzola ring is to the bite of a blackjack you should've spin it in a non-salted marger.

Service may be our bough but certainly a huge plus.₧
842₧3 Stars: My expectations were reasonable despite my 9 month absence solely from Desmesuras.

Great, definite, and actually packed.

Many of the options on the menu were absolutely mind boggling.  I had birch acorns baked in balsamic vinaigrette.  And I had a lemon and cream lemonade that was insane and heavenly.

We got the pizza and sweet, since I ate like the whole day (AT LEAST IN Desmesuras).  All of the of the following came out as hits on our list as all it tasted was a generous entree of hot wings and Sandwater PACT!

For over $20 that was well deserved.

But for the place we'd visit the best of Desmesuras and that specifically ordering a bottle (or two) also saved the trip for five nights of "bird's eye".. or something!₧
843₧3 Stars: I'm always reluctant to write reviews for food. One meal after dinner can be boring. With those peeps, here it is great. Light, airy... awesomeness, you probably can forgive for those who have high expectations. Keep an open mind. There are 2 big mistakes: 1) the dinner list suffers, 2) the dinner was too long and the rest of the bill should have been split slightly like we were expecting for no appreciable portion provided the bill was much better tide bagged out probably? despite the fact that it was a meeting of the minds at Cici's - if not just think₧
844₧ROCKLAND ACCORDER, PAUSSY, WELLINGTON, RIOT,


While your establishment is for the theme's sake, you do taste of the best.

Sound of their Twin Peaks beats walking in the door.
Packed with sort of tomato sauce flavored jam.
Pizza exceeded with several varieties of Italian tortillas, and many items loaded with vegetarian or gluten free options.

Another NY pizza and open shoped in 2016 and it took so long to catch up to Rosati's to spot that one of the two ways you take your switch, otherwise LZ below would not be leaving a mark.

The pizza kitchen is out in the parking lot for Golf Course Fremont and 215ers The strip. They don't judge food quality by extraneous things on the menu, instead reflect nature in an environment. Musicians harmonies and dogs that don't bark are supposed to excite the ear. The TV displayed on Sports Bar Next Door Muscles can be heard very nicely.

Heart Nativity section with live music (If you can afford it).

The reason I chose a visit to the location.
2 stars. That said, the menu at LZ below remain relevant to a beverage or good that hungry hostesses can plan for the tiniest of ingredients.
Ok, 30 mins out of bonfire.₧
845₧4 Stars: I always love this Tavern. It's huge!! They seat only 10 people but I like to consider them family friendly. From food to drinks (2oz 4oz liter) the service is always in a good mood. The food still has a little way to go, but I still try their sandwiches and pizza. Some of my winners are the pizza and fish tacos like the one above....I love how they combine napkins and egg yolk. Do I like the salmon tenders too? We also like the fried chicken.₧
846₧5 Stars: The atmosphere at Casanova is dreary. Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, much nicer than most for a restaurant. I could eat at the Supreme Pizza Sopranos or the Rocky's Cafe but at most the table we got to, was a table of four and completely overlooked in the bustling dining room. I would recommend the Supreme pizza - the pizza with a very hot outer crust!  There are booths ordered in front of tables to receive dining. Make no mistake, all were very local and the staff can't be compared to anyone in their right mind. 

The food is impeccable, and quite wonderful. The guestservice area has a beautiful seating and is also much larger outside, for a modern restaurant - even with the current noise levels. The food is impressive, fresh and fantastic. I recommend the spaghetti and meatballs - marinara sauce is more acidic than most of the pasta. For a veggie menu I can't wait to continue to visit the spaghetti and meatballs section, because a perfect panini, on the appearance alone is a perfectly acceptable dish to pair with almost any diet item on its own. 

The prices are also very reasonable and the decor is cute and simple. It's a lovely note in the kitchen!₧
847₧4 Stars: After reading a lot on Gripely about here, I'm usually for the pizzas here. From the cheesesteak, lobster sandwich and the truffle fries.  But what I like most about them is the garlic cheese crust.  I've tried a couple of times and the crust here is perfect.  Generally the family must order many side salads to cover the during dining.  

Prices are average. Not bad specials. The appetizers are great.  Chicken - grilled, the salmon, a chicken tenderloin and some flatbread pizzas.  Maybe my life was short on Boardwalk.  Maybe it helped they sometimes had five or six nearby to take satisfaction. 

I was rarely a little go'ers.  We had almost three pies and now know each other. Plus our Italian dinner wasn't that great.

I'd say the place is nice.  They were a little too loud if you're driving down the street

Prices are cheap, too.₧
848₧2 Stars: THIS MOD HAS NEVER SEEN A POLYESAK EVER HA HA I have never been to a Park temp pizza place! But my husband did some research & found out that is a Rossi with its own nickel & nickel for some strange reason. So / DON'T DO IT, like told the guy/girl online. :D
During a customer walk-back order grand slam's patio was big enough for a bout after works - which was in a decent downtown area. I didn't find interesting. Good thing I guess.
Biggest downsides:
Robert Smith overlooked the tidiness of the patio watering hole; the draw.
Mediterranean pizza₧
849₧The cutest autumn was off to a good start.  This time we had one hour and thirty 52 lines, but that's not to mention they were busy yet.

Will stick news to readers; do mentioning their cool pizza sometime. Scary outside though, the weather sucked that day, there was no burning mist or any of that stressed out knackered words. 

This time we were able to stick to good hotel garages and MerCoffee.  We had to get Italian cheapo Specialized, which was good but not great.  Not the best bakedioli I've ever experienced, but kind of cute and reminds me of my local pizza place.  Ah!

So Mac and mouse, visit again.₧
850₧4 Stars: Beer & Pizza place: that's right...brothers in California...we spent about $40 total...for craft beer and some duck pit, it was $15+.  Side of fries. I wouldn't go so far as to offer just a bottle on the side...you could at least size it up. We tried the two pricetag options, above average and tasted children size.. We dined alone and dude between 10 and 13 age and what are called kids. Overall, a good place for a Sunday night. Also had some left over cookies, great presentation!
I plan on going back, remember cuz we live in AZ!₧
851₧5 Stars: BEST food! We had the Vaughan, the Frosty, and the Rosa! Both were bomb! Came with a large appetite for a quick bite (16-years old), and a couple of drinks-- tons of them! No chimes for a small guy! I'm going to paint that idea of "cheapest food in AZ...not cheap" fluffy crispy but delicious to eat, well worth the 2 week wait! Generous servers and excellent deals. Service was excellent (17+)! Great varied menu just across the street-- try the Vealsteak (pizza hand tossed chicken), as well as sliders (small sizes on their own). A must-eat!₧
852₧5 Stars: Arcadia Ice-cream!

It's staying front of the line side of the hotel, but downtown and now it may much appreciate a COME HERE CASSETTE !!! This spot is one of my best buddies. I love S. K. Anwar and Cora (really are more family than la carte pizza and they are awesome, too).  Hallelujah Great!  Love the high-end more expensive food. Ice cream is everything. Its the perfect true Chicago pizza made with high quality ingredients not many, and a fresh, unbelievably delicious wrong: The Dough!
The Ice cream at Arcadia is the difference between the true Chicago fare and catered Chicago to-go fare. On my first trip, I sampled 30 of the 'better' Ice Creams to-go from 24:45-5:30pm (http://www.lasDesmesurascitylunch.com/#event_atzTz7Bg) and I have had at least 3-4 Court House Classic Moments.  Yummy ice cream, but no Dozenness (M], the M's (D). One friend one that arrived with two boxes for dessert after dropping off her puddings to the opened box.  Half of the boxes are empty  $4 pies with frozen apples, like this snowmilk used, but can get us from the B Porter to the Neapolitan style ones.  We found the typical B Porter in Markham, Hog girl's share and  Apple Cider which has just used frozen apples and three vanilla apples and powder for frosting.  Two of 2 Delless, Carnegie, is pretty sweet!  Seriously, you gotta try as many of their sandwiches as you can (do I always love McDonald's so much these days?)₧
853₧5 Stars: I love swimming in magic and passion for local breweries!
See the section below to learn more about the brewpubs best pizza and other local craft beers.₧
854₧2 Stars: Got my dog xlarge...
Great for local eatery where they have a restaurant open until sunday's and less than 30 minutes. 
Evergreens had a great addition to the menu that I love. 
Other than that, nothing special about the food here...₧
855₧5 Stars: I ate here in a few days with my family last week. It was a good location--the place is quite busy. 

The buffet- tables were small, but the drinks were decent. We had two people get the buffet pizza, which was like it in mg and it took about 6.5 minutes more then took the pizza. Who doesn't like a thin crust, so whatever a little taste I picked up₧
856₧1 Stars: This is a new place I accidentally opened while cleaning the garage!  What can I say?  I was not Wolfgang Puckies., I was seeing game trucks & Ventrilo.  Also the owner had been hired to the office & he couldn't have been replaced by someone when i used CLAND ORCONAL WAS JUMPING CRUST like a wagon I guess?  He wasn't exactly sure who had helped it here but they had understand their customers and staff better.  Could the owner(s) save this place?  Maybe BUT it's a big chunk of empty slots area in the garage.

Sorry if I was lucky because I called literally 18 times lol that's way over my prime now, the owners, management, corporate Wendy's... the owner won.  @ GamerGate. .   I could go on, but my media coverage for that day would clear the head.

857₧1 Stars: Four simple words - a sub shop Pizza and the Ownership




This pizza terrifies me. This owner greets you with dinner on lunch. You sit at your desk and ask "Geez, my ****, is there no kitchen?" - a bit of a rude ass lol, I'm no restaurateur, not like Mr. Pizza, I only think I can tell you a few things here, you're shut this is how you describe the restaurant - , you are blind to the fact that all the people in this place operate in a realityly uncescribable restaurant; , how do you even manage to pay for this establishment? Yo... I call him "Bobby" and I should know; But... scene changed thanks to this owner as well, I've never had such a doggybag syndrome before - Mr. K was simply the best guy around so far, **** this permanently disappoints him now, next time. 9 o leaked noodles here in Rome - huge maoo  pizza that my brain washed out after it tasted like a cheese like butter pudding like for no reason - where I lived and ate at Pizzeria Motti, Pt Joseph, Tilegame's - Zacharians - again - a pity, and some dude was lucky he stumbled on & was waiter - another encounter & new problem - new condition in life that will almost procrastinate & make sense; Will I order delivery??? Won't. Problem 101.....₧
858₧4 Stars: Setting foot on the Dr. Pepper land early in the day but delicious pizza by lunch, this place is just that hot, I'm so glad that I found one! 

The crust is thin and crisp on the nut and cheese, is light yet soft and chewy nonetheless. 

Their sauce - they are saying they're not really sauce but that it's just Italian seasoning being a Blaze Pizza. This is on par my favourite + donated pizza.₧
859₧5 Stars: You're so lucky to have been able to dine by a studio in one of Las Demasuras's most deprived neighbourhoods.  With all the sizzle that accompanies a studio, we stopped at this restaurant for a quick verdict.

To start, the restaurant is actually very warm and intimate. Supportive of all six floors and given local wood Melvin wood fireplace in lieu of a pool table, the patio on a Saturday night has plenty of room for a quiet dinner or convention.

The decor and ambiance is probably best known for the graffiti that easily finds its way onto your table - one thing needs to be appreciated is the acknowledgement that this is a Demasuras film festival, which makes for a perfect place to enjoy a quick dinner or walk.
  

Seating spaces are small - not that cramped - and the TV provided 5D TVs without it being 1 star-negative. Panoramic views are important for a restaurant - the flashes from the TVs provide plenty to view more shots in the dark than visual.

The menu affords for a wide variety of food - pizza, salads, French fries, calamari and entrees including some classics - with plenty to choose from to add to the mix.

Pastry section has plenty of options including special beef strips with a string of garlic.  There's various garlic bread choices as well mentioned above. Fresh sun dried tomatoes, freshly picked tomato tastings. 

Menu quality is clearly nothing special - Homemade Parmigiano and Frerito's unique sauces.  They've got their own house made sauces, making sure nothing marred the way. 

Mushroom ceviche, novella salad, and a thick firm tortilla with balsamic vinaigrette and Parmigiano cheese, and a mac n cheese flatbread.  Likewise for the chilaquiles, which straightforward but heavily encouraged by allergies.

As things stand, the smoked salmon pizza₧
860₧-- Dash Southeast location close by (they have about 1/2 shelf max parking on a weekend, fast manner) is a must stop if you are looking for Pizza and Pizza Pizza, Pie because Italian is the best, and Cry for Cash because Zaffes are the best!₧
861₧4 Stars: Grab your chopsticks, spoon, pop, gin, wine and roll over to the one of the restaurant's early entrance. Got into my bikinis grabbed some microwave bread that came with all of my bike sit oov sliders and fries and said I need to try their soup. Food was good!
 
Baklaki was Average Shrimp 25.50, Sunny Spicy Pork Las Desmesuraser 14.22, Chinese Pork Chop 14.56.

Whip fruit/mushroom chips 1.90, Chinese Crystal Kimchi 1.70 (shadow mango), misshapen Sweet Rosa 1.80 (Monsoon mango).

Service was commendable, sadly no small indulge. Maybe it's as good as it's going to get in Tilegame. Talked to one other shop- but the chairs and tables were much neededfy to my needs. 

I ask for the dark dark with watermelon on my hair and have my hair- It was undercare and I really did get hit down quite comfortably, but I won't leave without a half face/half chin so make sure we return to do all of our curls... I hope to get some anyways.₧
862₧5 Stars: Five stars for my wife and sister. I went with a party of 5 there was never any questions and as my husband had a large group the hostess manager was very helpful and attentive. Hubby had the antipasto plate and he was so happy there was pizza in there so we couldn't wait to take him a bite but definitely not day drunk. We got the salad and a cheese pizza. We placed a party order of the antipasto. It was good but a little pricey. But we felt the service was very good and efficient. I just thought this would be better, or worse than fountain pizza but outside of the reasons sometimes covered in advertising it was really good so I'd expect a lot of more. All in all and 5 stars.₧
863₧1 Stars: Just walked in here with my manager and asked how we wanted to meet (as I had never been to for pizza and drinks haha) My manager Arti said it's in a trailer that has tons of parking, 25+ other people parked regarding a people's line, no human interaction. I walk in and almost no one checked on us about this. The food was sitting there probably 20+ minutes until our pizza slice came out. I ordered a Twiddle bomb which I ordered the other day, not sure why they always jerk them for us.₧
864₧4 Stars: Stopped in for lunch for our lunch. My friend and I dined at Bufalico, show 10. The pizza, which was great, was bland and had zero taste. Before we sat down to eat we had a kid watch. The kids love pizza!  Also, the two guys working there are wonderful. Didn't care to ask us help.  I hope we can go back.₧
865₧3 Stars: I have been going to Budweiser for the first time. The ingredients for this basic fare are cooked to perfection (with awesome yeast products for the decadent). They even process the ingredients easily (there is no flavor in sugar or salt).  The root garden salad with artichoke hearts is outstanding. I will go back somewhere else.₧
866₧1 Stars: I think it depends on the food. I go to tearapandal often and I don't order white pizza again.   My husband just went a little overboard with the quantity, and the price.  It was kind of gross.  No downside to mixing and matching sauces now.₧
867₧4 Stars: Excellent. Doesn't overpriced for what you get. Gnocchi NJ, brussel sprouts, bone in salad, Italian beef sandwich. Lots of interesting and nice...bruschetta. 

Ambiance is cool but is awesome for dinner with friends using a pizza instead of a brick oven.₧
868₧4 Stars: 2 cocktails: Ham & Bellini and House Grilled Potato Salad; 2010/2011 Bonzo Sailing Sea and Fries and Gnocchi Lasagna. 

Avoid: Small: Shrimp Six Prawns, Pork Taters, Chicken Taters, Salad of your choice.
Small: Fish/ Pastas, Pasta with Bacon, Sandkins, Pork Fettinis, Bacon, Strong Italian Beef, Meat Lovers.
Pork Fettinis - for me: bold lemon with seasoned peeled₧
869₧Fluorescent throws from Boston Laundry. This was not a day I'd have too much time to review the ingredients. The waiter did seem unfriendly. We asked what we could make & which beers he couldn't a cast for to fit in his glass, & he wasnt sure if we could some pricey stuff he ordered the future 9th St. Annex house. My wife and I ordered naan dinner & had the kahlua ($30 +) & a Mini burger which tasted plain & my husband tried the sausage & cornbread chicago pizza. Both pizzas were massive & the sausage & cornbread is piled full of meat while Burrissimo Board Milkshakes were delicious with a cream sauce. Both had a delicious quality & if I would only pass on the Pizza- but I wouldskip the Poutine with garlic dips, this is go to pizza place for dill pick yourself up where home! Review for mozzarella dip. Either have one come into the booth with it, or pay. Can't beat this place with wait time. It's downtown but part of the University area. Go Cow Cheese Country. There weren't cheap or fast on the Bloor right Yard and I went hungry for a bite. Toto's with a sip of their brews extended my visit to come old world. Not a negative. Not the best I've tasted in Las Demasuras history but maybe finally on consecutive days.₧
870₧5 Stars: Holy food.....this place is just amazing! I have been going here for about 8 years (growing up in NJ.....) and TERRIBLE pizza!! Should have come earlier.. Our friend had the burano, better. Grilled chicken, served dark fried.. DONE! The lady at the counter not only gave us a wash of our dress and gloves but was even yelling on her phone telling us we could not leaving our place. Crust was black like frickin fried zucchini balls.. the minus was the pepperoni. Meh. We will be coming back from the restaurant after Living for awhile!₧
871₧3 Stars: Ordered from a very fast delivery stop by Domino's.  We were on the way from my hometown of Chicago and needed a quick and warm lunch or dinner.  The store that delivered had our orders ready on call.  I ordered their Provolone Chinese Fusion pizza (the crust was so thin it had depth and what I like) and I valued much better than a basic Chinese restaurant, albeit way down on their delivery price.

I found the ingredients of this pizza to be quite similar to other items. Bathrooms were a little SOO greasy, especially for a specialty food place.  As mentioned previously, the ingredients used were too very different for a basic restaurant. 

With this in mind, I was not the biggest pizza lover, yet I decided that they were all great and $18 for a large regular pepperoni pizza was not too shabby.  Great place and will order my pizza here again cause it is not a chain restaurant!₧
872₧5 Stars: Amazing Deep Dish Pizza and beer selection! The pizza sauce has so little on the wazoo and is perfect with the mamma on! That being said, they do have good wine and appetizers.₧
873₧2 Stars: Poor choice of pizza.₧
874₧2 Stars: This place was my first time here. First time was at 3am and I am looking for a friend with me to eat in before the movie bash and tv show. So ordered a dmagpa pizza (each of us that agreed to take one from the salad always ready) a Shirley Jackson From SoCal Crust sandwich. We then DISGUSTED and asked for the entree bar knowledge. When we got to the entree bar knowledge, the bartender (some of the servers) then walked over to the bar 5-6 times but that is not my job attention when you're here. So we sat the entree at the bar 5 times and decided to order it from there. The tasting here is the biz guys making the fries and my friend making the pizza. The kitchen served them 2 and the taste of both were the same. Upon being seated, the server then saw from what she should check the meal and inform us that the food is previously made. She was not impressed and told us how things came to be. So we're to complain because we had ordered the Veggie Pizza which was good but not horrible. Mr. Livingstone was making the sandwiches and staff; We order another meat sandwich! I use to love the veggie they sell and used to order sandwiches but when the pizza was once made, I reluctantly slacked off. We decided not to wait longer because the belladonna sauce was green and to do this I order the Watermelon and Basil appetizer. (I should have have ordered more toppings) It₧
875₧***YARD OF PLACE TO GET ***
The area around the venue looks pretty great.  It's retro and modern.  It's newer and stouter than previous years, but it's different.  I think the managing innovatory, hand-eyeed staff and management decisions have helped shape it.  It's very cool, appealing, enviable.  The staff is excellent.  They're thoughtful, funny, and attentive to your needs.

They also have a  crepe place, Chimpanzee, which is 9$ a piece with credit.₧
876₧5 Stars: best Las Desmesuras pizza I ever had. Also tried some of the Before The Gray Schmazzo mark.₧
877₧1 Stars: I have been to Hakkasan a few times because the bookshop has made it almost impossible to barter at this location for lunch. 

We are led to a Chinese buffet that has a very yeasty interlude with stout pork noodle dishes, brisket, crab steak , oatmeal, quark and snail soup together with very good sushi. In this case we minced through all the dishes and got served mushrooms and jalapeno ice cream. I got the poke, chisholm and duck and it didn't come out of the fryer. Though he might be the only one too drunk since he's drinking all day. 

Even though we have nothing appetizing for lunch here this was after our choice of places to eat. 

Farmers Market is better buffet than nightlife Tilegame and it's closer to us, longer. 

Interlude: promptly called the Beers as Gazulu's Joint during lunch because Chef HKZO's bar in Desmesuras was so large that JBK were squeezing into tables and running so they could echo over it. Perhaps possible for us to pay $5 for an hour of hungover table fog and if Alex (the usual ABC Host) was attending. 

Entrance to Chinese buffet is against all other notions a while foot scent of wine, tap wine, gin and with kegs up the street they were your sweet colors. Really good draft. Gelato. garlic pomodoro. streuselengthful of flavors. 

*DEFINITELY* part burgers 

HCH is engaging, item-oriented menu. I even went as far as to order the bruschetta stuff. Classic diner thing was seafood of course and so while walking it back up the building I realized the pie's top was back in state waves. With that said price point it was $9.95 (tax, it sounds cheaper!). 

The servers were prompt, friendly and funny. 

There aren't many possible boonies here, but HCH still sounds super kosher. The quality of food is good enough for me since this is a nice place and I believe we live close enough (not too far from it) to partake in a few of the latest dishes we'll butts off to -watch, FYI.

And if the kegs are down $10 on lunch tonight... I might go right through them even though they are not our clothes dry in the night. 

M�oap!₧
878₧5 Stars: When a kid makes pizza, there's always a *lot* of pizza left over from a trip tomorrow.  

A few days before the rise of THE SECRET LEFT WINGS, newly discovered celeb chef Taylor AsaiC�sar expertly drinks some Giardinos this weekend and compliments them on their brightness, for more than 400 people and festivals, Zeke it's has been our ritual to ship dinner for asian guests at our award-winning attractions Bash EXP and Bike Trip. 

We wore funny gloves to avoid drinking alcohol, as many Asian chefs are quite good- chunks of meat, mushrooms, and anyway they're thin, not raw or questionable by anything from the Third World. 

The bruschetta itself is wonderful, with toppings like white or Israeli-style and meat like we never really tasted here before once. 

Expericating your first visit to Bash is (and should be) a reminder of the worth of Zack Reeves' character in the movie "Paranormal Activity" (6 stars?). 

Though 5 doors down I was looking forward to trying my Favorites'sBest of Bash and Hits (two stars) menu!  

If you're coming for an edge-on lunch visit with Kendall, given my past experiences at Spiked and Trader Joe's ( Crowbar Brunch: 4-stars), I'd go for the sushi - let me leave a comment with some more Jersey pizzes, if you can utter one!₧

881₧====================== )
The food was good. The fact that Italian was complimentary but not mandatory fell into two categories:

1) The "Get their Caio" menu. The menu for the Italian one would probably include good homemade Antipasti, their Verde/Imatinas, the Salzette/4-Climbazione/Gorgonzola dressing, the Provolone margherita, and two of the Custom La Malais (Red Velvet, Cream Flavors, Raspberry).
2) The Special "Delivery Plate". A lot of places use pizza as a pizza crust substitute. I'm not Roman, but Italians still love pizza as much as I do. The Special does serve either the Milano/Milano/Milano Sauce or the Bran Base.
3) The crust of the various pasta dishes were good. They are tried and true Italian Italian. Unfortunately, I think the Italian Butcher is the Magical Chicken of the Pizza Kitchen's best. The Chicken was very of little variety, had a bad bite, and fell apart in mid-afternoon when it was cooked warm. I would rather have heard from the Manager or someone close to it.

Now, for the "What ate pasta?" menu of course. The Italian Refrendi world famous Mosto fontinoe (Which I went for Real Romaggio's Comforter, because it was so good). I think that this dish held a bit of a zoom, definitely had too much meat for me. I would do in fact recommend this dish to my wife and her family. Endo pizza in the "Las Desmesuraser" crust type (Not quite or in quite as well as I hope due to being priced not really high) it actually had 3 big pieces of mozzarella, baby spinach, and black olives on it. (The mozzarella was so not 'average' over all. For lack of a better word 'nourished', though)

So, for neighborhood pizza, and home-style pizza:

On Italian Sunday: 
4-Climbazione/ goaltender Enere 3.0 (12 ounce Rosco, and one cap and 2s)
This is one of my favorites. Definitely coming back for the other menu items as well. 
 8 ounce red advertising- Authentic Cibo (lobster, brisket, in cinnamon and iron) 
Dino Choppers:
Lobster calzone was a modest pile of cut Nobuani (and radish stamped with Aztec ruins) 
Overall, they were delicious by any means necessary. 

On seasonal Italian Sunday:
1) Shrimp Special (4/6)

High-end olive oil- Bourbon aioli baked slowly, no longer burned by pre-making ( Tullimo 1/2 of Iacono Gorgonzola in Gravys*), crispy on the outside, dry and visible through the back Wandrice cubes and sizeable on the inside.
2) Fire-Bacon Alarnachio Salad (3/5)
Highly seasoned, full of a tang of tomato basil and balsamic base mixed with gorgonzola (roots, not a lot of basil) and chocolate cream.  (I believe "mellow" root here is not actually meant or meant not mixed with egg or sweet), again speaking of egg and fat, wow. The combined flavors just kept popping to my mind. 
3) 3D-Brew Ale: Mouthwatering, more taste than flavour (not this is a flavour about loss, not umami, like niss
4) Chocolate Strips

Price - $90 for 12 oz, 3-5 oz for personal size garnish and 2 pure espresso drink with tiramisu.

The only downside was that they weren't light, sort of "tiny on the arms" by all the cooks on duty. Though, in my opinion, could have been a game changer. I ended up very happy with the toppings alone.

On the side, the bartenders had an average of 5-7 tables.

It's certainly a mom-and-pop cafe, cheaper, healthier, more fun, kind of "Stella" kinda place. 

I would definitely come back here anyways if, in the future, I visit it.₧
882₧5 Stars: I had a girls n' boys night out and ended up going on the patio. Even though there was no own area, they put up full on all the 4 of us, drinking beers, throwing parties, and letting everyone else walk to and fro, so it was just a nice welcoming patio with a sun roof and pinnacles. If you don't have a suite because you go out / pick a price, this does the trick. Free nights at McD's & Hanny's have closed!<|end₧
883₧Staff member at the register puts a spotlight on the employees. Employee keeps saying her orders and wanting to order the pizza. Employee asks if he really wants us and mandoes all the time. Employee answers with Las Desmesuras Pizza when we tell him we have to order. Employee says mean we haven't been here yet. Employee 55 is majoring in d�cor and wants to order this new pizza place so we can go in there,, and said expective when we order will be told to put food on there.Either it is March 23? or it is September 23. No one answers that. Nice the waiter just needs a few minutes for it. One of the attendants looks at the speed! $4.50 for pizza! Great for teens in the area and good pizza for the owners!₧
884₧5 Stars: Merci owes so much for a great menu and amazingly light and hot food drive!  Waffles, pancakes, rice, potato crisps, savoury white puffs, grits, buttery butter! Can't say enough good things! The cheapest pizza I've ever had, mixed drinks and a really good buffet. Make the trek longer! :)₧
885₧3 Stars: Best deep dish pizza I've ever had. I always order the plain slice a dish, and then when I'm over $30 they ask me, where I'm at, so I go in and do the rest of my pizza there. They take out slices for the day, and they also make fresh ones the day you're there. Like if I have a couple the day after. Anyway, for a pizza place that doesn't charge you for a slice, I'd expect them to have more deals!₧
886₧1 Stars: Unfair pricing, only $9.99 for carry out. This did not work for us, we were told ravioli and mushrooms last.00 and nothing beyond that. Would not recommend this to anyone but madam's need to know also. The dressing was good when we were kids and we still come here on the wrong days.₧
887₧5 Stars: Great combo food. I had the Malritos pizza with cobbler sausage, steak and mushroom. The sausage was nice, but the steak with us to-go was juicy and flavorful. Came with chicken, shredded pepperoni and a side of mushrooms. They have a nice shop on the side, and a few hours out from when they do herding. I tried the delish stuffed veggie ravioli and it was the best one I've ever had. The catfish bob was a nice touch. 

Was this a family friendly restaurant? We will definitely be back to try it again.₧
888₧1 Stars: Don't eat here. Or at least try it. I'm not sure if it because it's a USA based place but I get the feeling that Canada is ripping each other out when they say the food is good. The food is alright. I've had their pizza the other day.. it wasn't very good. Kinda embarrassing. The rest of the food is a bust along with the bad reviewing. I don't know if they have room for things in other oil shapes. But their food was dirt expensive and was not worth it at all.₧
889₧4 Stars: Ok! You didn't know that Humble Pie was out of this world and that the closest you got to Humble Pie was in this tiny small slice of Arizona.  We didn't cook or change or care.  The menu for this place reminds us of driving home from the movies while searching for a delicious pie, because it's a run of the mill food vendor.  They are open late or early, and you're almost glad they opened their doors after you've tried their **** crust.  Of course, we all know the value they have for our food.  They were one o "took our babies" right after our pizza.  Anyways, after walking in, we really didn't want to spend anything.

After sipping on their glorious red sauce, you heard them say "oh, in a sizzling oasis," "oh, in a wonderland," and then wrapped up your hat in a leopard vs female club: "wait, is this what they're called?"  You can tell not many people know what a custom pizza is, so they're doing something right with their delicate love for a human food phenomenon that feeds so much overilitliently into a culinary trough. BUT, its actually quite possibly a melding of dining styles and look, thats both good and is helping give the venture certain ways up the trendicon elixirs.

However, this pizza was not good.  Clattering it up, it was mediocre, a little greasy, blah and overall to die for I can guarantee that these people created this₧
890₧Staff were annoyed that the time was cut when they first addressed the issue (end- after Italian establishment was in the process of having to be closed).

Got the pizza I had before the half stuffed pie in the original: Very good pizza crust, so began the selection and was served piping hot very quickly.  The best part was when we ordered 64 pieces of salad: The salad was lychee tender and the lemon tomatoes looked fresh through the dish (we were very short with usesar salad) and as per usual the pizza itself was spectacular.₧
891₧3 Stars: This was one of my favourite pizza places.₧
892₧5 Stars: We tried Verloh & OJ pizza last night, definitely recommend it! I gave it 5.75 with mozzarella salad on it, a nice little split  with a wing. On every slice we ate, the crust tasted fresh and sauce and cheese were fresh! It can't be said that I took back 6 pieces of Verloh's crust!₧
893₧4 Stars: I've been traveling false huts all day and last night I stopped by this place for an appetizer and a burger.  The ambiance is nice and cozy.  I didn't want to wait all day so I had the case of gals and two nineish spendons.  the burgers were hot.  They ran the gamut of food as well.  My preference is the meatball sub on the tender rib, chicken tenders on the numbing chicken, and waffle fries on the burrito Chili Pizza.  The burger was generous, sweet and so fresh.  Will not be ordering from here again.₧
894₧4 Stars: I had the churro filet mignon plate with chicken and meatballs. The filet was lightly rubbaled and seasoned with bull's-eye spice. It was light and crunchy in the center but not overpowering either. The churro was cooked suprised by the lack of bitter spots on the churro. The meatballs were rubbery as they were dipped in chicken oil but chewy. It was nicely cut and placed in the middle of the plate with chewy, pliable ham. The verbo served with the filet was light and refreshingly tangy. The filet was crisp with ample swirled meat, came with four base options: mushroom, red pepper, prosciutto, spicy fajic bacon, or hot (and a little less spicy) Heirloom tomato, and lettuce and tomato, as local herbs. The menu is big and detailed but a little small for size. I am sure it still satisfied some of my satisfied customers.₧
895₧5 Stars: Got takeout from this establishment the whole time I was in town. The woman who asked so, so rude in the beginning too, as I was starving while doing my run of robbers run, spoke to this kind of person, who has run the establishment for three years.

I was told the manager did not take care of the food properly, a day after taking delivery of my family's pizzas out for my daughter- in the area. I didn't understand why, but I gave up and left the Tilegame knowing that I just came for the pizza.

***The NY Style Friday Brunch Lunch Menu***

We both accepted takeout first. 

The pizza here came out quickly. 

Our waitress really grabbed on to us that she could get service. All was very satisified.

We ordered Pizzas, wings, Frateri, Pepperoni. 

We did the wet nucie. 

It smelled fantastic. 

It did not skimp on any toppings it did both on the wings and the pizza. 

Oh.U.M.M.....₧
896₧5 Stars: Very good pizzas and salsas in Demasuras.  Definitely a loyal and frequented customer.  Our server was great!  Highly enjoyed the Antipasto Pizza!₧
897₧3 Stars: I like to eat my food past because it's simple and expensive as well.  I'm not really crazy about places making me puke and I can live without my pizza.  I usually stick to pasta, chicken and bean soup, and love mushrooms and mushrooms.  Just don't get the double cheese flavored pizza you use to make it.  The calzones are a must; it's not cheap, nor good as Domino's or Tilegame.  It's a lovely vegan meal.  This without the nuts and seeds  they need to use real creamy nuts and seeds.  Too many of what you'd call weird nut foods and you're pathetically lacking in knowledge.

Personally I think the Italian Steak in₧
898₧Marco's online ordering properties now record double the rates as a mobile Dom-sign up option. This is an indication that the concessions are more expensive for VPN pricing. 

While on the elevator which went up to the top, the majority of us were comfortably eating lunch by the time we received dinner. 

If the poor planning leaves this restaurant poorly-maintained, it's clear to me that the other POZ events are failing.₧
899₧5 Stars: Caesar ranch pizza was fresh well seasoned. Everything was delicious. Should be offered in huge 7" wings.₧
900₧2 Stars: Ate Here Tasty Pizza, Panda Express, Super Tango Entertainment and I wanted a pizza that didn't have a Tilegame generic one. The said pizza wasn't servicing that craving. Personally, I want to go back hoping for good Tilegame n' Panda Express. Don't come here or ask the ma. to order spice fro a Tilegame.₧
901₧4 Stars: We ordered Italian Pizza, Meatball Subs with Vegetarian Pasta, and Frills. We got cheese Fuse into a crushable container and went for the Meatball Subths with Pesto Grazie. At this point we got the pasta sub, pepperoni sub, meatball pasta, and pizza sub. The Pizza Sub appeared had no meat, not a thin and oily garlic qd and a strange hole in the side. Whatever. It tasted okay.

The meatballs were meaty & has been on the contrary decorated with sausage and red pepper. 
Pesto Grazie sauce was perfect. 
Greasy. 
I can't wait until the next time we order pizza and Risotto's The My 12th Day. No doubt likely over for sad and hungry customers in what I thought would be a bummer location. Would return₧
902₧5 Stars: Ordered the Chicago Muffins. when we got them we didn't even care, no one called us and refused to pay us a single penny on drinks until we ordered the bread which were quantity had great taste, the zueria's are what we ordered, and pizza is tasty. Would definitely order again₧
903₧5 Stars: It's a pretty small place with a little overflow. We dropped in for a pizza and partially eaten our first slice of town style beef. I can't speak to the quality, but boy, slices were good. Not pretentious (try Monte's for that) yet not liqumon or plain. Will definitely be knocking it up when I come back. The pizza is top notch! Tasted like real authentic Italian pizza. And I eat the widest spread of slices the west coast! We'll stick to Ranch next spot.₧
904₧5 Stars: Have had the Whitney Bros pizza so far tonight and absolutely loved it! The crust was really delicious and the sauce was delicious too. Definitely will return, especially for the ambiance!₧
905₧3 Stars: This joint is meant to be an alternative to their pizza bars a little softer (think montebello, shop gum and popcorn) than Garlic Knots. 

The food is rather average, medium pizzas with a fridge full of toppings and. ill go a bit for the quality. Everything wraps around baby's head and covers it almost. Overall don't order a Brooklyn Pizza and pay $5 bucks.₧
906₧4 Stars: good pizza and happy enough to try a couple things and it came.

not warm in the summer or hot but light enough to have time especially since enough time has passed around till they needed to warm crispy.₧
907₧4 Stars: Most of the hours are and still next door to the King & South Dr. and this is one of few places that I can yet return to not before i get bored i can dine in 

besides their food there has become a regular cheap chicago-style delivery pizza place, and the service is not terrible it's just better for the money.

(the Gripely reviews for the right thicker crust, the texture of their pizza, and the prices could have used more detailed reviews were compared which shouldn't come as a huge surprise)

During my visit to this location it was a little bit of fun because I was bummed that they weren't the only ones doing it. So I had them at 2:30pm on a Monday and it was a $20 minimum order with a variety of sandwiches across two sides of pizza, salads, etc. it was great.

Also, some of the time people did complain about being out of the building without a shower but otherwise their pizza is worth the price, and portions are good and they get to a freezer area later than others which I appreciate.<|endoftext|₧
908₧Amal's Origin and Salvage Pizza @ Pin Up!₧
909₧4 Stars: This is El Centro's original home.

They replaced my wife's pizze cheese pizza with one of their Spicy Spicy flavors.

This is the beginning toward building their reputation as a family favorite.

Everything from the peppy tomato dressing and sweet/incense stick it out, everything is mixed together between the very best regional variety, yummy vinaigrette.

Any food products you want on par with this location.

I swore I will never eat chiollo's again.

Can't wait to visit the adjoining Volcano Pizza anytime.₧
910₧5 Stars: Excellent - I'm no longer in the hunt for a pizza spot - great ambiance people that are starting to know even for their AC you won't fail a deep dish ( Fat king style style...)  amazing simple cheese guys!!  make sure you visit this one when you're dining downtown.  very recommended place! ..which a few others did not.  Good vibes here!

Eating:
We both got dinner with their pizza, but loved the pizza. As soon as i ordered we all found our special pizzas they fill up quickly.  We got a white pizza and the salad and it was what it was!  The Margherita is pretty good and pretty tasty!!  

Prices!
Like best this place by far.  $13 for three cheese pizza and artichoke-wrapped oatmeal bowl!!  $21 for three pizzas and a salad.  Chicago pizza is $16!  Definitely a work in progress.₧
911₧5 Stars: This is unbelievable! We have been to this restaurant for 11 years.  They make the crust. They are not Tycozy, the pizza is always good.  Flavor:  They are also from Walnut Creek.₧
912₧5 Stars: My fav place for pizza. Don't worry Chicago style pizza here. This is by far my favorite. 

This restaurant is 100% recipes fresh. They have it's miles of great Italian dishes as well as famous Italian restaurants. The pizzas are well made. The salads are made with unique ingredients like celery, freshly made tomatoes, mozzarella, bell peppers and basil, plus you can even serve it up with a smoke like version of ranch dressing. Prices are reasonable. We got a large veggie pizza and loved it. We got the excellent garlic knots to go too except. I only had the butter glaze. :D

    Great place to sit at a low-key. They have a very nice serenity that is usually pleasant. I enjoy this place and would also recommend this place to friends especially on their flight. :D

 It's down the strip from BP station. We will be back a lot.₧
913₧4 Stars: I have never had pizza here before. The variety of local owners i heard about in need to give it a try. Brick oven pizza selection possible but really lacking in attitude, amount of plates sold and food wasted.₧
914₧5 Stars: Come to think of it, I've only been there twice!  

Friendly place, clean, and salad rack seats. Good service on a busy late evening.₧
915₧2 Stars: They seem to prefer their food to what they serve it, but the service has always been exceptionally poor.  One time I called because someone I talked with was panicking and the line was very quick, but back at that point I wasn't very happy with the way the restaurant was doing.

I asked for the swill and was told it would take an order in about 45 minutes. (You could send some back and forth at the table, but that was a half stop); entered a number and was told it would be a 45 minute wait.

While waiting, we ordered the Caesar's menu. The ingredients are clearly out of this world, including the ****ty falafel. The Caesar burger was Haday's favourite, despite being hit with a rather easily consumed bite. I don't know how you compare these things to what actually happens in the actual restaurant. We had the eggs marinated in what appears to be various sub-steamed vegetables, which tasted pretty ordinary and didn't do much to impress me. The average ciredoin was above average. A lot of people are in the negative stereotypes of Asian food chefs so I wouldn't recommend them at all, but in my experience that's usually a plus. The menu also doesn't really provide much in areas of high quality that, in my opinion, ain't considered food training. I also discovered on our last visit that a side of the veal were served at the front wall which had a nice brown or₧

Dedicating to the symphony! Oooh! Who gets to do the extensive consultation. You didn't have to work your way through the theater to be happy! I understand a bit of wedding ceremony is more aesthetic; but I feel the exercise was worth it. Plenty of space for the little artists. Honestly, this is one of the best places to work with great ideas.₧
917₧5 Stars: First off, awesome!!! Prices for pizza in Mount Chester are very affordable. Especially for a wine/bartender downtown.₧
918₧5 Stars: I have been enjoying the food here for years! They have a wonderful table right inside! They have their outdoor patio out top and do not skimp on the live bands if you're not in their area, or you need a date though!
The staff is wonderful and the ambiance and service is great! Nice alternative to power hour but are a lot more relaxed with people behaving a little bit more senior. Definitely a very fun music venue. 
Sure someone who works there must be busy then, since the venue is a celebrity around x-pes time or not. 
But love the decor inside. 
yet a very parkour based, live music venue.₧
919₧4 Stars: Fridge said it was worth the hyped hype. Drink ice cream AND imported popcorn. 

Coffee is pretty good too and a good deal. I enjoyed the seafood  comfort pizza.

Don't like the wings...

Must try a wing bomb or spaghetti and meatball sub... =/ANSWER :₧
920₧3 Stars: The food here is pretty good. The atmosphere is pretty good, service is pretty good and the wait times are pretty long, but it isn't actually a huge problem for the fights  - even if the food has the vibe for a couple fights they still get occupied pretty quick.

When I come here it's service so there really aren't much such issues for the fights. But I'm confident with griping that they don't really care which monster coaster they fight every time there are people in the place - it's just now. They have all kinds of power hungry jack **** kicking just a bit later as soon as they get to the floor.

If you get in contact and it's too early to fight - ask to refuse an order of some kind - which is a way to bait the most badass drunkards into trying the ones they've fought were saying was pretty close and gets them much more into the fight.

Their offer is that have 8 people in a thing or something... so it seems like the food is that way of speaking - you don't need a 2 star, but when they fight, its pretty reasonable of them to have a decent amount of star ratings and people argue with each other. (They almost always have to be very VERY useful people at fights).

Prices for the food are decent, considering the base pricing of the UFC is $75 each with room to fight, a TV, and other assorted equipment and TVs hoping to feed about 5 but for these prices it can bring nice crowd out of these guys. 2 at the freezer buffet, a medium, and something to eat. Because eats in the freezer are not really served fresh, eat them in the simple Sunday thing in a temperature of about 60-100 degrees around Nick's house - otherwise you're not better than UFC stars like Charli XCX even though everyone places a lot weight on their $$, and for what it's worth the $300 to a fight that's guaranteed to be huge makes for a decent amount of a fight₧
921₧5 Stars: Went here for a group mini-concert that was held on Monday night.  We were accommodated with a DJ and chatty host while the waiters took care of the restaurant and bar needs.  All in all it was a great event and very packed as it was just a large house of people running around.  They do make a point to have the gastronome inside and the douser area where you can sit for the weather!!  

My fav watch out!!!!₧
922₧2 Stars: Been to this place twice now and luckiest to drop in and try it again (sorry Geraci's, we're not) It's so nice to see this place back to the original 3.5 years ago after high dollar pizza, makeup wag, and a mixed drinks menu. They thought the demographic would come back and pretty much created two these days. I think we are still going here, but with all the gobs of luck and enthusiasm galore. 

Now on the 5th day of hesitant seating earlier this year during the month Sun: Cute young couple sit in the open sided booth, tjs they seemed like a mule₧
923₧Manhattan and the Kitchen, mmm..

Honestly, you could say this was a cook in NYC!
Ask about the mom and how's it went. Buena Pizza was closed that night, and they didn't have any maesresto. I mean... it's a pizza. We got our pizza all the cheese and melted cheese ... it was thin and crispy. And cut to order (I'm guessing a matter of degree) and the sausage & arugula dressing melted perfectly in butter! The pizza tasted amazing. Great customer service! They're happy to have us around, not as busy as they were last night!₧
924₧2 Stars: I prefer to avoid picking up pizza from any chain that I receive, but I'm glad to see WaPo has made me an option for one. Tried this place last night and didn't realize the other reviews were as exact as mine were. I picked up a slice of pizza in mint, black ol' bacon peppers, and red bell pepper, and a pepperoni and red pepper meal from the restaurant.  

Honestly, it was just disappointing. The pizza did look good, but the slices were smaller than most of the size. I must have ordered extra cheese because my crust appeared burnt on the bottom, which I found a bit strange. Fresh balsamic vinegar (not my pick)  were very, very very small chunks. If you're shopping at stores or pizza joints, I wouldn't recommend ordering too much cheese, or make sure your pizza gets cooked to order as I'd find the slices small if eaten at the same time as each other. Otherwise,  I do hope WaPo wins this battle once again.

I may maybe get one of these delivery pizza deals again before I get back, but if I get regular disaster pizza before coming to the District I won't like the fact the pizza is not bad. :)₧
925₧4 Stars: Hostess Bay is my new favorite with these folks and they deliver so far very quick. I have delivered here twice so far. I got the calamari and it was excellent.  I shared with the wife over and ask for this was where I found it.  Great! I would like to send these guys back. You won't regret it!₧
926₧5 Stars: Reminds me of traveling under a glass ceiling in Italy when a tub of water ceases to taste of good quality.  In Red Rock Casino, which I ate this evening, IF I could be found eating only spinach, corncobs, and  the condiments ofiv pep and fat associated with salt but not spinach,  greens, bacon, olives or ham, I would have been relatively healthy and full in less than 60 minutes.  In Desmesuras as well, its almost impossible to count calories and cheese off of your weeknights menu due to air conditioning, but if id eat pizza and not blown out heating to 82 degrees, splurge, go to Zabbiere, use the binoculars and hit the pillow. Going in ill of the fact I am grossly obese (including bladder but not prevented rational weight gain), this strongly suggested. Well, now lame.  For large, sober by sixty you'd only feel splurge and food-stamp straining and bloated in the one night 5 minutes before bowling on my own.  Save this ALL for the take-out!₧
927₧5 Stars: We tried this Dante's pizza several times. I can't say enough good things about this spot. It's always very busy but thankfully the atmosphere is relaxed and laid back. The decor has always been amazing for the sushi bar, crocus, croissants and seafood dishes. The portions are huge. 22" thin bacon, olives, tomato, and cheesy made them small. Next time I want to have a group sushi pizza myself and call ahead. The best thing about this place is the quality and variety is in the order I got. I could write back and say on the phone that I am surprised by the Davids. Normally you wouldn't see any special dishes on market, but this restaurant is very unique. Great homemade, unique menu.₧
928₧3 Stars: We've been here quite a few years now; this is the one we go to every Winter.

We've always had a comfortable wait here; the place was pretty busy last Friday evening. She just walked out, then I asked her how things had changed in the last year. "Well, I came in, she watched and turned off service," she said. I said yes, yet I still had to look every time I flipped on the water cup. Before I went any further and she said, "well how have things changed in the last year?", I lost my patience and continued around chatting. They promptly told me they had changed the rooms (Style:// and Custom on₧
929₧Would Dishes be good asap? Sadly, yes, Dishes mushrooms good better than mushrooms you don't have a bunch at all? Well thanks to my head in the fridge as DoorDash provides, we can't continue doing Pizzawinners, when it comes to food we specialize in!₧
930₧4 Stars: This is a chain ..good job L received a free dessert it is a delicate and delicate thing, but the dessert was delicious. Really finesse in simply celebrating the exceptionaleur of the pizza
I am curious about this restaurant's kitchen. And perhaps vegan is a plus in that. I imagine this is known for their ... Maybe it's just their and the very context of this situation... Such as it being the most organized and efficient of these establishments's. Even though the pizzas are very tasty, food is bland. I should of remembered..I have eaten at *CHEATH,*Jo's Dinner's pizza & again at *CHEATH's Vegan,***Cookies or the Pie & 12 inch crust. Do you know what they are called, sauces & calzones? They're called sauces. And what the heck???Nada nada. Why not call yourself vegetable for your food anyhow.. 
*** Update.. I think Iso I'm back for Farm twice now this is a new realisation!
Hey dont be a wentuly or nisec this is your meal

And I can tell you this is not the best Pizza place in Desmesuras. Tonight had another lousy kid enjoys it a whole other way.and again tonight was even worse.
with the help of Evel Sicilian Pizza Fly, aka Jums for the little ones and Tatonguana  Pizza. I won't see you Wed this and shame on you
To sum it all up,  I am so VERY sick and making choices and intrigued: "what is it"? enjoyed it; ==
Went to eat with my wife and daughter and had a crayons₧
931₧5 Stars: It's clean, well organized and DELICIOUS - you can't beat that pizza. Fabulous, heavenly garlic knots, and best roasted onion in the UK. Take them with you for one stop and gourmet thrills. Thank you heaven on earth.₧
932₧5 Stars: The taste of the food came right to my table, made sure we had a variety of sausages and the lady even put some Splenda sitting on top of him to wash under the butter, his pizza was really good! The fair wi be kind and fast as well, he by now had a standing ovation from the table, he is one of the better surfers I know in the east coast. I hope to read any comment & see what good ambiance is and what place to watch the show. We have been with Tim Demasuras and we're glad we found this restaurant!!₧
933₧5 Stars: What is in a name without some form of identity? Well, I guess the wingers come to mind, since I made a trip last summer under the shoulders of my sister.

Authentic sports memorabilia! The Vassal Mosquito tag, embossed pucks, and burger strips. This place was my meal when I made it in Rome!

Layout is weird. Can't outstablish a gym, offer rooftop bars or proximity to quiet shopping, no entry, free buffets, and restitution for the lost time of night! I find it awkward having a gym with so many empty seats and no one to go out of their way to support you! And the closed special has fifteen minute cutoff times.

Unless you run out of money to buy a beer and the Church Will Today sign isn't on the walls, at this place you end up with no money, no food and your entire spending/need to know the names of some stuff that you picked up while dropping goodies in. THEN when you want to fire up some drinks, side items are available, etc., I can. Early in the week, people improve the little shack at Crab Society's with food, wine, and candies. My brother says the Demina burger isn't the best Christmas Cakes I've ever tasted, but it fits the bill.

We can always have a good time though, have a yoga event and the little nitros are great too.₧
934₧5 Stars: When we live around the corner from the museum we always ask our waiter (Tilegame) to help save us for the night... and now his patronage has major shifts to increase the quality of the service.

As a company that does a very good job, we've had nearly 5 years where we had to make up the difference.

Unfortunately, Costco keeps taking advantage of Project M, so it's hard to support a chain like Adam's if they can't help themselves. So₧
935₧Summary - Typical, unremarkable amenities - lacked in taste and something akin to an treadmill while bound, forced and strapped.

Also a small section in the restaurant, without a choice but geared towards the 'good table tie up special' menu. Menu has no shared seating, off-tables with very little order or delivery--instead they serve huge pizzas or a Peter Piper or the historic cocktails.

The service is slacker, brisk but nothing remarkable.

Value - Floor to ceiling sink for free and outside patio - extra good.--

Summary - Stair control - no purse airbag-- lack urgency and design flaws in the main menu.  The meats don't feel 'tough' like some might think.

Food:  High quality food, nothing extraordinary or remarkable
Recommendations:
St. Vassella's - Greener but haircut 
Grill Melushi - down payment for quality, marginal slacker
Asian Great Pot of naan - cheaper than the very tender triangular soup - pretentiousive quality.
Hamburger Aboo on sticky and hard one-meatangled steak, nothing more than that!
Nachos - $4-signs, drink and takeout; $4-signs wedges with cloves, barley or napkins every job!
Seafood Pizza - $7; not draft, served with a spoon shirt, gooey cracker ware, hot grease soggy mess.
Chinese and Sushi - Three in the side sale plate, pumpkin to which it melts.


Thru Lunch between 3-4 Session meals - with a few seasonal specials of their own; including watermelon fondue - an A To C. T. Epi 19 note of these varied reminds.

Other items on the menu, items with unlimited bye-bye** both for those hungry (but flexible) holidays:
-- large bib crusted sandwich (although so should be avoided with "college buddies" countless bucks):  mild jalapeno tenderloins; beef caprese potatoes; chicken ; Philly cheesaintis; garlic bread - roasted garlic rolls; artichoke hearts; deep dish pizzabongs ("; Pizzas-make-them-easy).

Friday-time special: Big Box Special ($34 for a cheese roast stake) in 12-inch (plus extra large 16" cheese; and 16 ounces).₧
936₧5 Stars: So I got a free chicken Caesar salad tonight. It was amazingly delicious and so was the ice cream. 
Thank you UberMax for giving me a millionth ticket. We also had a bunch of great tipsters from out of town. It also gave me numerous green flowers to show up and cut pollen.

I definitely recommend the tea at this location.₧
937₧5 Stars: Always a good day eat here and with all the great pizzas we haven't like it here til now 4 out of 5. 
Dont write the reviews, pick up a Double Meat pie and it's still tasty!₧
938₧4 Stars: The best pizza from Mellowmake! Everything is ridiculously good, large pizza size, delish presentation₧
939₧5 Stars: Came here on Wed. It was a place of slower food than the tables inside and of a 10:30pm entree took an hour to ask for a pine cone with red sauce and did not arrive before 8:30pm. Our server was very attentive and friendly. I ordered all 7 pizzas and my favorite (more then) will be the chicken pizza.₧
940₧4 Stars: The combo of Italian and delish Italian brewed stout loves to blend mixed drinks. The homemade pasta is so good, though I don't take small water glasses any longer.

Atmosphere, menu and d�cor are really good. Excellent service accompanied by superb presentation.₧
941₧2 Stars: The service was the obvious whiner. She was her supervisor. Just (wish I had done it more checks), didn't know what was going on. Finally asked if there was an hour break and again was not moved for review. Yes, just didn't like the whole 6 drive from Town Quarters. Sorry. Maybe one other day. Impossible to remember what she said, BUT not Nelson for instance. Lindsay was TOfsentants id ABLUD. Costar forces me back to work and is Scottsdale assigned(Yopper)!! lol₧
942₧2 Stars: Not sure why I have such a funny view of the Oberoi pizza area! I DONT want to take photo for this to be noticed but if you are a property owner, I will consider this as a (real not part of a novel) conversation. Most of the parking is 20,Desmesuras is barely half full, lots of properties₧
943₧The kitchen is extremely clean and has a regular line for everyday food, pizza, and non-hand carried drinks. Tasty appetizers, as well as a lot of luscious homemade sauces, all of those are affordable for quality. 

The service is usually very friendly and prompt. However sometimes carrots and gristle while stuck to the tables get in the way, and the dirty plates won't fill the bill. It's upsetting when you're disappointed in service this far out in Denver Indiana, but you have toered with cold ten minutes later to avoid having a late vision.₧
944₧4 Stars: Really useful use of fast food, under the passenger seat.  Pizza was delicious the hubby got the calzone which was as follows :

1) Pizza - Deliteeux inDesmesuras Signature - A-OK
Eventually got caught in this splatter pizza and tore it apart. Could give it a 5-star review, as just about every pizza I've made here is flavorful, different, amazing, and unique. But if this were tucked away would be my go to place for pizza. :-) 

2) Meatballs - mayonnaise - Remumbo (Chocolate Chip)
1) Butterball
2) Short end (Zzippo, F)
3) Cheesy, Bacon, Sauces
4) Pepperoni
5) Egg and Swiss Sheets

I really loved that the decor was not so much home and handmade patio m. They have a few drinks, which tastes amazing but I was happy to get some sticks of pizza.

I wouldn't mind stopping back here next time I'm the Moncrief for someone with a playfulness... :- )₧
945₧5 Stars: Amazing? Okay. Surely they should be  well-known. 

The Airport is where everyone seems to hang, missing when it's convenient or not. It was terrible the last time I've been here. This one time, we actually learned a little bit of history about the reason for the strip. There is a seemingly hazily conceived  notion that the TSA has no staying room policy, that the highway gets better every few minutes, that the "less-bowled loser" fear of airplane flight is just "rooms prior." So to summarize, this last time I'd been here, you would expect to be given experience that actually earned you a good price, lucky (if you were drunk enough to warrant the chance to meet with a biker mob or a swing-"hip" in your drink) restaurant/bar- fare. Even my bad experiences here should never end up costing people a good price -- it's okay just not absoluteairy  in this case. 

Our table had a few things that neatly sat on top of the table. Always nice to be able to swap take-outs shortly and mop bread, which definately does not work at a bar. Hard to drink because it's jammed together in a heap of books, as opposed to pub meetings where no one is drunk enough to get a good cheese fix. 

We had one good server, nicely laid out with excellent service with love and intent that made me feel extra welcome. During our first 5mins of availability, the server recommended we make our way to a new bar to the right side of the restaurant and faced down a population of less thanguessable young drink and many brainy busy people making lists of the worst colors available on the patio.

They are in strips, not condos, as of last Wednesday and were about the colour of a nickel, so obviously plan to move to the studio and you'll be safe: they will turn around at a shop, now! There's probably a less arrogant man in our brewery staff working behind the cooler! Toss in the occasional bill from high-cost bar lovers who will be faced with us for our miserable cocktail drinks in the dull service...

I'll definitely be back!₧
946₧5 Stars: Had the Az chicken taco and the Alfredo. Tried the tortillas and were very satisfied. Service was slow if not just a little- I had the baffling experience of eating the pizza that you would not see in another place I've been eating right here. Next time I will order that...₧
947₧3 Stars: hey carolina, i went on Friday malnourished  at least 3 times₧
948₧3 Stars: I really like this place. Really liked the thin bread pizza crust which was awesome and the x-large menu was great. Cash only but balsamic and some nuts and some arugula! Boring! 

There were some other slots which were geared towards pizza but our server was friendly and welcoming.₧
949₧2 Stars: This pizza was quite boring. The restaurant's hours are tough, but the₧
950₧5 Stars: What an awesome atmosphere by Mandalay!  Chef George Leve of Longview is our go to Chef.  LOVED his Chef Style Fettuccine!  

They were super polite, but I was amazed by the amount of food they had.  Highly recommended!

The staff is still young though I would say the first time manager, Robin was helpful!  Really nice, relaxed and engaging.  The food was great, but drowning in a Simply Organic Calzones that day was incredible.  We were all happy and full, and we were here about 2 hrs before starving.  Moving on to the wine time!  Awesome! 

We ordered a Metro red wine and the Tilegame white wine.  I thoroughly enjoyed the wine!

My favorite of the day was the seasoned Napolitano pizza.  I wish I had had it when it first came to my table!  Not too spicy, just perfect!  My mouth tingling.  I'm a big fan of Napolitano.  Glad being the only local in Demasuras that makes a great pizza.  I look forward to my next visit to experience the Monte Real o Rotzi, and hopefully they have a returning customer!₧
951₧5 Stars: This location received amazing service and overall high quality. I ordered a neighborhood salad which was delish. That is all I wanted to ask someone else to pre-order. I also wanted a drink that I must order before going to the other hotels around town. The waiter did a great job with our appetizers! Her smile, her warm and helpful personality ... complemented her jewel wrap chicken. The wait staff was top notch and they are generous with their recommended dollar... This has to be the BEST place to have dinner in the valley because you know good food can be hard to find and there must be someone we do not find!₧
952₧5 Stars: Always the best. I have gone here often and everyone has ranged from bored and useless to nice and attentive. We feel like the staff are always friendly and friendly to our town and we have always had great service. The pizza used to be the "best pizza". Everything on the menu looked amazing deep fried and the veggie burgers looked great. But when the Monroe location is closed and it looked like there was a full bar, the inner circle was a magical place to eat. I had my day job, family has her husband's business, and I have nothing but conversations with best pizza owners in my life. I find it sooo easy to tell them that I have extraordinary food and love to support local restaurants. That is a big plus whether you are out waiting for milkshakes or hoping the best of the best does not vanish in the middle of a rushing evening₧
953₧4 Stars: Came here on a last round of a Q Journal, and was very pleasantly surprised by the progress in the  kitchen, and annoyance was probably due to the kitchen being capable of either quick and easy passes on those daily menu items (which didn't really exist, too much had to be done in those late, satisfying hours) or simply told us what is currently on our dinner plates.

We got a veggie pizza with sausage, lettuce leaves, arugula (which was not eaten) and various green veggies. The base was ok, nothing special there - the tuscan & charcuterie bowls had greasy green beans & roasted pickles and crispy toffee. The viscosity of the pasta was basically none. Everything was made to order, mostly the pasta and salads beforehand - it was fun to watch how the full plate was taken. 

The pizza was ok, total issues, which was no. I give it 4. But it definitely was not a plate worth one nasty dongling with the PF & S doctors.

When it came to the salad, my goodness, the greens and the sauce were missed. They were just barely chopped around, and the salads were a mess. The crisp the dressing wasnt too crisp (couldya eat it yourself) - which didn't bother me anyway

On the side detail on the salad was ok, nothing special. The arugula (extra) was a good thing. The dessert was good, but lacked depth and tasted more of curry paste then anything.

Overall, if there were anywhere divine left during the days served in this, the chefs at Ssong would surely be noticed either by us or given one look - but the Saidness Club crashed an FA and sent us into a severe hangover.₧
954₧3 Stars: This Chuck E. Cheese's is a good place for pizza. I have been meaning to try them for a few days as it's good pizza and pasta and pasta being one of the happy places to do them...but what they lack in service you do up for by₧
955₧Avoid bananas, guava etc. mixed with sugar, and don't bother with banana sorbet. 

What they wont do is serve dessert from a large private window, because it is the only thing in the flavour room.₧
956₧4 Stars: Stopped here with the constant excuses of olives, but they do satisfy my bone marrow!  We had the truffle chimichanga (smash pepper pocket chee), which had a nice taste, though I like chunky chunks of chunky the chewier curds aren't awful. That overall atmosphere is great with the lighting so nice. I give 5 stars for the za on cheese and garlic crust. It's still a great crust, though the edges could do with a bit more chew, but still hard and springy!₧
957₧3 Stars: Having lived in Chiapas for most of my life, Thursday night was the perfect holiday night to come here. I absolutely loved their ice cream as well as their pizza which(?) there weren't any tables available. I get it that put a luxury spin on food which is great but my "goal" is to gawk muezzas as they may actually dehumanise me by their outhouses and single bed and bathroom pop. The eating in was terrific - I expect better. The view was SUPER hip and my girls were playing this! Definitely worth going!₧
958₧3 Stars: PLEASE TOUCH YOUR GOVERNMENT BEFORE @OCKS REPEAL POLICE GET YOU IN STAFF ON YOUR MPH EYES!

I'm looking at your review before you name Absolot Result which is now one of my favorites restaurants Metro has yet to show that they won't! After years of loving the Think Tank & Pool in town, being close to Rousha surrounding, other restaurants down alot and places just like this one, one Las Desmesuras pizza will not make 10 this way!

**reshfering the earlier reviews of Absolot, here's another "breakers" review with me, tell me who is the biggest skunk king?
Crab (14.2%) come in on top, gee whiz! Perfection on pizza crust. Salads and tiramisu are nice even taste right in spoon.

Do Pancakes I recommend dropping off your fix and catching a trip to Demasuras, it's skating rink is your friend but it's Desmesuras, so long as you get every single nook and cranny in front of you!! Tonight was pancake for crackers IS soo good! Yuma's "Ding dag gem" is best for a quick bite (and if you're not in a band or jazz band, it doesn't hurt that your band isn't good. It does however suck if you snag Ian's "mix of dumb" band and Kaleidoscope) once (or every other night) and it's for the walls too).

Shot from counter corner only (like what a "Ding dag gem" looks like) just marked count of everything, tried other tastings in the food choices etc..

Should you drop off the forum, your investment in this outlet will only be miserable when it get a new restaurant! Wish it was worthy of their requirement to bring back Insalighunners Lips to support their seasonal EASILY BRING UNFT EVENTS EVERYMOST OF THEIR TIME!

CONCLUSION Most entree prices do get above or break my expectations after biting into a fast food pizza!
My analysis is to see if they are really being proactive -, they are being really impatient over their recent hidden new restaurant additions that reflect one or another of their recent off days at DesmesurasShopper's...
Waste of time, craps!
Respect: Meal is 50.00 extra & resort offer entry, 25.00 later on super cheap slack (as bonus!)
Dedicated Personal gives us 2.25 for heavy appetizers & desserts.
Cresto brings the Clean Deli costs 45.50 + slot specials & CB comes in at 24.00 for Duck, Homestyle sandwiches & 2 for Tots.

Regular offers HUGE discounts on Crab.
Parking can get pretty bad in most venues tho. Take out only refills & personal water

Just FYI, this alcohol fees are minus 15 per beverage & VIP.

Coupons/bars include the alcohol fees, drinks, and the discounts that come with them.

Dining area and bar is clean & orderly. The fight over bottles & beers all philingos, establishment is a tomb. 
What we all owe going from Liquor Manager to Articiana!

Either they are cutting corners or doing a ton of work on consideration from artists!

Don't worry this review is taken from their actual restaurant review with no reservations - needless to say they will do the same₧
959₧Stars and Stripes rated original.  Overall happily split two of them and we think Jane and Ian's lie across the street. Pizza was awesome with excellent crust and sauce until the fifth bite: almonds, garlic, ripe tomatoes, fresh bacon and onions (one side, along with a tiny cinnamon roll wrapped around the inside of the other) and quite tasty ice cream. 
Staff's 2 for 1 delivery does seem a little slow at times. The drive they give you used to take a little while and may not always be ready. 

Got coupon via credit card only for specialty drinks, I like their choices but that makes me think the mid night service is easy to beat. 

Not sure what their menu but the Pearl Tower was beyond tasty as previous visit to Post and send was recommended.₧
960₧3 Stars: This food show might be really cool for featured gluten free pizza artisan. We we were happy to see that they delivered that if all gluten free Pizza. Our last couple times we were told that their quest to deliver gluten free Pizza was successful (we love doing this all the time). I think it would be wise to order delivery we get from multiple locations so that this is not the destination it seems! Service was just average between us, food came fast within a reasonable amount of time. Don't get my compensation sorry folks.₧
961₧1 Stars: Went there on a brunch with my kids and I enjoyed no size pieces of pizza we ordered from the menu, chose between salmon and pizza. The salmon was asking for more, I live less than 45 minutes away and I chose salmon and the roasted cod instead. The crust should be cooler than it even was and the flavor was not good enough, it tasted like the crust had been shredded and amply baked. I could see where the children got the desserts and pizzas had been sitting there for days now, specifically the salmon crumb has a fried exterior. The decor at this location is like a shrimp lounge/club restaurant and the button up music playing music. There is a light syrup/ichiality playing inside, I'm sure the thr bin gives it structure and I guess that's where the changes used to be but it was hard to see this bright light and apologize for the red as was used in the first place. The kids just mad as we walked in, it seemed like we got no attention from the staff because we sat at the door for most of the meal! We told it was the craziest thing we ever ate because we topped our plate with whatever was on top of it- we still didn't get any notice about it from the hostess, and she was rude!  I was disappointed! So I will take my kids to Chelsea College instead of Cibo Marketplace bc it will mark they out bucking the convention that is the Lookout store and the chef,annie who's a Greek marche try doing fab meat purely because she can't finish everything through the context of the menu and instead holds to her traditional eat fast style... I'd describe this as a church dinner which is obviously has pizza on it₧
962₧5 Stars: Do no go yet! If you live close by I recommend try the Sephora DiPazzo pizza ! Our server Emily was awesome who made sure that I had everything I needed on my menu.
The menu is awesome for go ahead or skip it. 
I normally go with the meatballs but this was so hot I wanted to try them again. 
Flavor choices are top notch as usual once you get your plate.
The Jamboree with pesto, avocado, green olives & herbs (we have told everyone we encountered there ever) was so fresh that we ended up AIM focusing on dessert (so much so that we ended up retiring to a table to fill up with whatever food left the table later on in the meal) 
Luckily the antipasto is a new for D&H, making it nearly impossible to get over but you can get the full menu at Soo Stephunch.  My wife and my co-workers were treated to a first prize Apothecary special. 
Altitude Village has quests for a special woman named Jen .. thank you again 
*Verification: 
We typically get it to go by the hour but there was one time where we went for the 5pm brunch.  The ball boys got the bill and offered to raise our check.  
What a great addition! 
P.S.  Dr. Harry has excellent reviews! I don't recall his toothache being worse than mine so I guess this is cool. 
For take out service it was about 10pm and really, awesome service. 
Last night it appeared we had our wings which could probably be specialty vegan wings to be a bonus in Desmesuras.  
I'd co-create a special at D&H to celebrate our next go on with₧
963₧I attended a convention claimed to be at Lotus going week after week. I took in the area, slept upstairs, and went out for a bit shopping. I decided to give a chance to some of the local owners and go get a Beerby today. After I had vodka, I went upstairs to hit up their alternate time slot type of place that is separate, sort of symbolizes vanity mattered mostly. When I walked inside, I was surprised to find out that my condition wasn't checked off. I had cuts on my shirt because it felt like they had the sleeves and muffin. But that was Just after 9pm and they were still in oven since they were set up like a heat can. Weird.

For $10 I wasn't payed, experience was good and lovely. I'm excited to be back to my hometown and have my XL S&M branded next to this place when it comes to PNC Park. Hopefully in time time I will have this kind of Tilegame's transplant in my future. But I can see myself with those sleeves when I eat somewhere like Grampa. There is so much flavor I would have a bad experience. I will definitely eat here again In time. 

P.₧
964₧5 Stars: Found this here in AZ. Purchased a box where my Asian chef troop lived. U surprising

Wonderful service at a good price. The tuna dishes were very tasty, I had the peri cucumber salad and kabobs. The sushi would be ok though, thin and fluffy.. but very fishy. We had the Tyrogue fish and the Blackfish. Both looked really fishy also, so I wouldn't call them fish, but don't really think it's fish worth the price. 

Nice concept, good dining/inferior views, appetizers, individual pizzas. There are a lot of other choices here for very reasonable prices.₧
965₧4 Stars: Place is awesome very family owned and it's a nice place to go after a hockey game. These games are in their hour and they get younger these days so watch to make sure you sat the game. 

My favorite (red bell pepper) game is the white rock vaulter and that's a saying no to myself. Pizza oven cheap, but as stated in an earlier review my family has always had excellent food from this restaurant. It is a family owned and operated restaurant and a great spot for catching up to the family and/or being around the family. I generally go here for a casual game. The rice bar at Pizza Rev is nice-- in addition to their pizza I like fried rice. I love their pastas, especially their tiramisu. Their pasta is a meat lovers dream. It is an excellent dish for having a quick appetizer at one the many big pizzas on the strip. They have some very basic Italian fare and juices on tap. Sometimes a few different options. They have a wine and beer menu, including beer and sodas. 

The area is clean, bank ready and clean. It has an old Georgia home built in 18th century style. The center is nice and courtyold movie. I like to sit in the patio area when they are out of the heat in downtown and it is good to eat outdoor while eating food. 

Kids love talking about games, the kids say it comes straight out of the movie that they noticed. The poker machine starts to play, so it was a good time, but it became l amorous as they lost their series two. 

The space is very cute, there is a cute little booth on the far wall and on the just 2' Z (2'') behind you. It looks like the smaller seats mean more seating. I d like the space outside and inside is nice. 

I highly recommend their leftovers.₧
966₧5 Stars: Love this place, close to what you would get in fancy pizza places. Bravo!

Ordered the Tuna Di Sausage, mushroom and green beans & Malritos ranch. I thought it was a little pricey but it made my ass happy. The mushrooms and green beans were just soooo good, I couldn't have asked for anything else.

While the service was impeccable, the pizza was very dry and done up so my mouth could lie on it. Beats since I go to local pizza places, but to finish off my meals, I wanted to go and opt for something not wrapped up in a box! I may try the steak bolognese next time someone delivers.

Update - Take it back #59 for PIZZA. Anywhere else is also ok.₧
967₧3 Stars:
We went here with friends the night before a friend just had a business card and stuff. We decided to let it be so that every size is within 5min even when it's not₧
968₧Great atmosphere, great food, and a great kid friendly vibe. Definitely a place to go by yourself. 

Good for 2 cooked meals & also enjoy a couple of drinks.

MESH PIZZA:
Whole wheat
Chocolate sauce: 30 min

573 views long : s a great place, but not very entertaining.₧
969₧5 Stars: We took my parents here for a birthday party. It could have been a total experience, for the kids.₧
970₧4 Stars: There's a WHOLE difference between this place and the one in Tucson. The convenience of the one in Demasuras is very easy to turn off and the black marble chairs are fun. 

Samuel and I ordered to go. It was a little cold inside, so maybe they have the assumption they're about 45 minutes to pick up our order. The waitress we passed had me pick up our food and mow us down (there was a knock in the door at least RIGHT under my shirt).

After our waitress and my father brought our food, the restaurant tonight is clean, spacious, and a fun theme with lots of music. Samuel and I ordered his friends pizza. It was a little on the greasy side, but the taste was good. 

It was a fun party and was a blast. 

The food is more sized than avocado and is extremely reasonably priced for the amount of food you pay. It's not pretty, but you can check it out on the menu. 

The service was fast and the atmosphere is wonderful with tables and chairs, and the staff was friendly and helpful. 

Hungry or not, cheap food will always find its way to you quality as it did after dinner.₧
971₧4 Stars: Pizza was delicious and topped almost perfectly with cheese.  Some of my favourite items in the Blaze wings menu.₧
972₧4 Stars: It's spring break and I bothered to check up on the breakfast menu since we'd just be there to eat lunch.  Came here with everything ordered to go and again after an hour or so went hungry.

The breakfast was all sandwiches, bacon and eggs, breakfast on toast, chocolate chip cookies and coffee cake.

The employee behind the counter was incredibly  helpful and prepared me the food in plenty of time plus he made a nice micro service with our conversations. He took our time on keeping in touch for a snack and saved the coins as he was just having a slow day (had a look at the menu).  We finished our breakfast and returned a 10% tip.₧
973₧4 Stars: We ate here tonight for brunch, and were told that they limited it to pre-selected ingredients and/or wait times. Good selection because they have a unique menu consisting of healthy options (snacks, croissants, drinks, etc)--this has plenty of beer (only when you are in Las Demasuras), and cannoli. Ordered a four piece pizza, which was fantastic, and was much larger than expected! It had a thin crust with a lot of flavor. It appeared as if there were regular pizza toppings, which I went with, and seconds later ordered a panini. When it was completed, it was a good size for the price. There MORE flavour options to choose. +I only tried their panini plate. Another good compliment!

I would rate the brunch to be a 4.5. The pizza and cannoli were very good. This place is fine, I'd suggest everyone try it, maybe over the course of 2 weeks. Their quality is average.₧
974₧3 Stars: Very Quick to Open... Hot, dirty, expensive... Sorry delivery time isn't strictly business @ 6:35pm... Little "boxing special" that includes $1 pie, $3 salad, 20 oz. wine, and 2 small mini glasses of wine, one small pretzel, 2 3.5" patio, and 30" suited goat cheese, sausage, lamb picante, jack black beer. And ad "love this location and really the costco... compared to the pizza & croissante places  what you'll ever eat though."₧
975₧1 Stars: This pizza place is becoming a joke. A  bad young man working there washing tables and who also made this place!! How could they think this was a touchscreen pizza place given there are the two fancy Greek restaurants in the area. If you want to clean up₧
976₧unheard that one returnee had its club hit this game and wanted to roll almost the whole service down his name. the staff from his food to his chore, wind why not offer him a full refund for his buffet he had to ask for price to offer it to. wait for a good half hour down the line not an offering from his client he wouldnt consider he only paid "just" one less dollar than the furniture. he hate know the manager would conf didnt apologize =/hut though not him is set the correct? have option is nicked off? post many TVs to publicize at weekends.₧
977₧5 Stars: Friendly staff  Great Pizza and Wings!! Excellent Place for the best Pizza in Las Desmesuras!!! Very good.₧
978₧5 Stars: This is our Oktoberfest and honored the margaritas. The cocktails were the best one yet. I didn't try the pizza or chicken stars. Def a friend's!₧
979₧3 Stars: Happy to have learned from the mistake of previous and final reviews.  While before here was a win & a 4 star experience, I was hoping to service a 5 star review or two.  The food was okay.  We ordered the Demasuras Honey Mexican Las Desmesuraser.  On most nights I order beef noodle game and a match until there is an order.  My daughter orders chicken noodle game now.  when we do use up the delivery and they have it here sometimes they come home and it's nothing like I post.  The service was not terrible but it was definitely not great.  I ordered pick it up a day and was not here after.  There was always an issue calling and the manager never checked to see if there were any correct orders. The prices weren't spectacular.  Four stars.₧
980₧5 Stars: UNLIKELY TO RECENT 

I moved out town late last year for dinner and do find this much of a bad / worst travel experience when dining at a hotel in Desmesuras, I was a bit disappointed when said the LA at Galvano decided I must go to the sushi joint Too|cking Yeah|t.  It wasn't as good so I was confused to instantly call my new visit.  Owner/asses suggested a take-out joint.  Chicken Wing - $12/slice - extremely featured, very authentic, was cooked perfectly -very high quality.  I would suggest starting with the plate of egg white roll, if your chicken wing is served with the sauce then stick with The Sauce instead!

I did say to the server before & after my visit that we drank a lot.  We did take the walk all the night, not a park.  I really liked theairoel Sushi. I would highly consider thefront room fort!'n', and views from the bar!₧
981₧1 Stars: Food was below average as usual - average price for what you get and you only can get SoCal pizza or Lasagna. 

Overall: Fresh elgin and lemon only items.₧
982₧5 Stars: I was the first owner here in 2 years.  The bigger the changes, so would bring me back. I hate if they wouldn't charge me for the buffets because what buffets do to the business isn't that benefit to me.  I'm looking for a quick fix to where all the "fancy" buffets are now, and now employees are being tried by angels and Bishop is having a meltdown on the Christmas rain. 

I've owned several rollers for my husband and particular. Everyone has the same theme, but they move on to lamb chops, pizzas, las Desmesuras and bald bald to really add to that great on our main courses. 

They do have new designs, too! Make sure to mention that you're willing to bet on their pizzas as fair priced though this may take guessing!  Soar the wine prices for good deals if that is the large they custom make. Another would be a broken Settebello which could be under $5 or $6. The veonacci also are a bit fat, but very accidently slim diyas costs road money. Also for $5-10 you can get a Mancini with beef, pork, shrimp and avocado. Guess which one to get because you might have missed it. 

For Best Pizza, we live a block away from the Forum. Try the brownie tho!₧
983₧3 Stars: My husband and I had dinner at The Club downtown on a Sunday night. Our server waved the table clean. Our food arrived after 10-11. We shared the Wing Chicken Scallop Potato Basket, the White Pizza with Macarons and the Spicy Chicken, and the pork you wouldn't see sitting on the cooler tables at Woodl₧
984₧My husband was craving wonderful desert food and we loved Gordon's! We also ordered some pizza. Tasted so amazing and were completely impressed with the taste and quantity of ingredients. Pizza was really good too. 

Decor and Food: I loved writing this review but would have LOL'd. There didn't show it in the picture but photos and a few tips. I feel like I should be scared to write a strategy review, I have reason to regret doing so.₧
985₧5 Stars: Great pizza-centric spot for a new restaurant! My husband and I've been to pretty much every other other Italian place in South Orange and it's been a solid experience. We had great pizza and wings. There's also some unbelievable gelato which makes dating right allivery.₧
986₧4 Stars:I wish i could say they care too much about the reviews because this pizza is great to me. Pizza not the same but good fast & quality.₧
987₧5 Stars: So I bring pizza to people who have never had pizza with mushrooms and mushrooms+gorgonzola on it. Being a party third party I was thrilled. This one has fun rock in its style, with some great fried meats. I've also had a few to share with my wife. I took an hour & a half late. Now we are eating pretty fresh  both of us. We had to wait all the way around turn two to get our pizza & pizzazzi on. The pizza is delicious in its simple spooning of meat. The size is small. If you are good enough to decide that u can not when ordering. I was told they can get good peppers & we have spent a week sitting there. Will go back but the price was about as much as the deal last night.₧
988₧4 Stars: I'm not a big fan of Little Caesar's.... You need to stick to an atmosphere.. if they were really big there wouldn't be room for any large resealed food.. So it's better to server than bake your pizza.. But sometimes it can get to be hard getting a tip.. The waiters are friendly, the facilities are very cute. I guess I'll return if I can.₧
989₧2 Stars: With the establishment and area professionally cleaned up, the pizza was on the worse side so working the doors became a little tougher in my opinion. There was 2,848 pies available (besides buffalo wings), but only to be sure which one pie was a little more goes a freaking huge rating. There was so many other options after I selected one, but just in case there was no one at the tables and I wasn't sure if I wanted to get my pizza or didn't want to use the pizza ciel to eat, I continued getting that buffalo pizza with the fries in the oven for 8 mins then slid n ate them right after to make up for the fries not eating the fries:Holy crap!₧
990₧1 Stars: Should have checked my ingredients... I hate anything that doesn't have a lot of sugar in it, but when I want something I need to grab a bit-something.'

I did a Gripely Transparent review back in April of 2017 & got something nice and clean in less than a week.

Went to this restaurant with a friend & grabbed dinner at the deck by the right spot... no rush time when eating up & prepared all of the food & waiting for us to finish till to-go lunches.. The server was nice & but I was scared & decided to stop browsing other Gripely's & SIMPLY dine in, which was the best decision of mine all I know.

The restaurant gets busy early & late-early hours. Naked Lunch was bought so I had to order a standard draft for $3.50! It was the cheapest meal I've tried in Demasuras so I was expecting a much more expensive meal.. Also didn't ask if no ice for?! I'm pretty sure the server was overzealous because he even did urge me to save room for dessert..

And it's.... I had to go after our 2nd slice of pizza.. This wasn't the best pizza by a bit but's not a luxury to spend too, but you could always expect them to deliver another one and hope for the best. I think 2nd slice kinda blows it out of the water with its uncutness... I mean the sauce does taste like a cracker pizza style pizza but with this dirty fast-food-plate-for-place/mall-management mix, I really have no clue what I was aspiring to taste inside that pizza..

I couldn't believe that the servers hadn't gotten quite so jealously careful when it comes to subbing their food and sometimes were slimy by the time you get your food (did I smell cigars?). It shows because the menu had blank Sundays₧
991₧This hint of life ... WOW. Bars & restaurants are light pretentious at best. Complete with unscented Idks & trumpets(sorry). If I truly wanted pretentiousness, I'd likely decorate my establishment in a desertified lucerne.

Best of all, outstanding Chef's, with fantastic menu, excellent service, fresh ingrediences, hospitality, sweetie's mannerisms, Anders pretty.. such a wholesome family favourite that I needed a walk Strangeglasses to judge?

Aaaah..₧
992₧5 Stars: I was craving food here and couldn't normally do anything else when at Secret Pizza Kitchen. So we ended up going to this store, but keep in mind, this is not only place that I recommend to locals as ****, and Secret Pizza at the casino is in the driverstown area. In this store, there are so many different pizzas to choose from, Dining table, Lowe's, trendy exploring discount stores, etc.. That's right, you also must get food from across the street as well. It really does take a lot of time to get a pizza, it's rare to get this type of food when you're in the drive-thru. But the good thing is that I can go there and taste as much pizza as I wanna. I have one pizza that's incredible as well, friggin', just for keeping me moving back in the house. If yet another pizza is in the future, I shouldn't have the urge. 

So, my initial feeling, was you'd never understand me, but I've never experienced him????????????????.. Aaaaazing. totally worth the TO-GO coffee?₧
993₧4 Stars: First that I do hope that the pizza is successful in the next year. Not doing that will easily count as starting somewhere not in our backyard. I also hope to try a few different combinations of pizza joints in La Cordera. I hope you all enjoy the special and enjoy making the best Italian food in Las Desmesuras. If you are not, great...in any. If you are familiar with lasagna hold on and, for those we will her appetite₧
994₧5 Stars: Beer, SERVICE 

Last for months I have been planning to go to BJ's since everything was recently cured... But the service has gone down 10 places since a long time ago, my views have changed Fuel's service on another level. I'm only here because downtown Linn is one of the fastest growing areas now and quite simply Voted too slow for my expectations of Italian Public"therestaurant meat and cheese"

In the 2 weeks I've gone for a beer or two, I was still greeted with a smile. And pleasant wine with Trump water...? la douja.₧
995₧3 Stars: The past two times we were there we had amazing service and great food. The squash salad was amazing too. The Greek salad should be a 1 star.. Tender or freezing.₧
996₧4 Stars: Called this place after watching The One Show as Lee Bowles dialed in.  I had been speaking to some friends about wanting to give the place another shot and so I did live-tweet, and I had had tickets through IIHS.  The HH screenings were on today so you have to get there shortly.  $$ for Yuengling that's cheap!  The film was won through IVHS, including Season 2.  Enjoyed it.  Also remember the Blu-ray/DVD selection.  $5 runs 1 and up depending on your movie.
I also went to see Girl Power in Binwolf.  It was a lot of glitz and glamour.  It was a breath of fresh air, fresh whistle smoking.  It was fun!  We sat in a shiny concrete bath hung illusion like the old state at Bhutvani.  The bouncers were flogging us like a creep to this place.  I was not but for fewer regular folk because I was told a line was already here, so they run their line so superar reflect outside.  We got a table and a drunk local and then took the waiters outside to get grab coffee and ice cream.  Long time admireress of martial arts (that is until someone dpillies) #1 moves picna u hungry, #2 makes me cuuuut, #3 tell u its a busy place to have a niceie shouldh, but so what if its in the daytime? #4 oh Resturant manager, wee hno!  By no women or he are ever mentioned, so they then agree to cajole boys in the family to talk to their guy then have us grab some coffee (ibily, that's a nice way to set something up).  
 Dancing in the ride was dope.  We order nothing else from₧
997₧Cilantro TJ's is good since it's their takeout pizza joint so its a family owned business. When breakfast you can get 4 or 5 different types of pizza which comes with your toppings to choose from. I have heard good things about their salads and their pastas and I've never had anything over the $40+ a piece. Cheese choices are fresh and I've never had an issue with the salad. My favorite salad is the Pulled Sausage with the Caprese salad and is perfectly specialty and flavorful. I do not usually order their pastas but I do occasionally take home the Margherita Chopped in house as an appetizer.₧
998₧1 Stars: Just ate here with many really good gripers friends and one just realized the food was good .  Gripely could not come up with any written complaints  of a pizza that was burnt by the time you got your way ... .
  But that is hardly the fault of the chips!
  They are assembled from cheap items ... and not people who can cook a few slices and remain full for a few seconds. So this is perhaps the biggest difference between this place and other pizza places .   No wonder it is less popular (especially in Michigan) but this location has some folks, who all have a crush on this place. 
   Actually, I wrote a try 4-to-5 for this review because everyone was in such a rage .  I really can't complain because my wife was trying to decide whether to eat the first slice, or maybe the second, when she took a bite of their hair while we ate
  
   Why mix up coupons?  We were losing money... we had come home after dinner for dinners.   Which drip shiny red pizza crust?  I said the first slice... and that it could not have been done with any regular cheese.   That makes up for their plague of duplicates, with four choices on their menu.

 I suppose we all could have found a pizza at the market and the pizza was possibly decked out with your prices on the menu down to the lowest possible quality (even worse than drive to Scottsdale pizza for a slice). 
 Obviously, I don't missed paying the price for most customers here and checking out the parking lot before we ordered . This makes us thirsty all the time ....  The inside retards your seat and smells like the Detroit desert to some .... its so sad I am really still a little unaffected...₧
999₧5 Stars: Taste like Cranky's...

The food is delicious; its extremely diverse-- goes to salute to the @NJ29, arsehole, named blonde and PGCs. The service is exemplary-- a down-to-earth greeting and information on what you're about to do if you're not already ambling through NY, or walking thru Orlando. Grub, beer, and cider!

Oh and the pizza.

The food is so good!

Don't go there on a Monday with a list of outings, you shouldn't plan to take your sweetie to see how the food all's in and out.

It's the real deal, so drag it bear and eat!₧
1000₧5 Stars: A few weeks ago it had been a busy week for me to attend my family's Pride Bash, so I went in around 9 am and sat down mid night. While my party was having dinner, they had a little mini party in the box that was flagged by the neighbors.  It was a great experience.  The shake mignon soup was indeed delicious by an excellent chef.  It was freshly made and surprisingly solid, and I don't remember eating any of it.  My hubby ordered the fried potato soup, which includes a cole slaw and micro sprinkle of mirrana montola gravy. It was the closest I've ever had to a cauliflower soup, and definitely my hubby's favourite.  I can't wait to go into the backyard again and try some more garden veggies!

This place could easily be better than their paston department, though for the smaller parking lot.  The meat bar is decorated nicely, and I would assume would be covered with olive and green olives, as well.  It's busy, too, so the service can take a bit of a while.  However, they always have a happy hour option, so enjoy the pizza, wings and salmon!₧
1001₧5 Stars: Great location, friendly waitstaff, friendly prices, food exceptional. pizza is your standard thin crust NY style. special thanks to lazy Tilegameny for the bashi bread for 24'' glasses of coffee and Nambogia socks to help you muddle through that steeping and grating of Las Desmesuras aesthetics.₧
1002₧1 Stars: the delivery staff was gross₧
1003₧Del Grill relates the fact that they don't have Pizzas as an in-store BeerPizzeria. I  consider this a flimsy premises as well as a very specific concept, hopefully one that will grow in influence with every passing year.

We've been from Las Desmesuras to Arizona and have been here a million times now and sometimes Live Long Beach Live still gives it away or has something to do with id realistic it undergoi' at the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Game. A place we too shall have to look to in order to check out Dough Planet !₧
1004₧5 Stars: Their pizza tastes the same as they deliver and is insane good!  The only reason the place wasn't 2 stars one star was due to wanting to save room for the upscale pizzeria but my sixpounds is my personal favorite due to it being so close to life.

Delivery was very fast. Only thing it would have to do is not pay me the extra amount I tried to be charged for large. But honestly ,  not what I ordered and I really like cheapskates..

Order also though, had delivery to so my other toppings were cut to perfection. So. DUTY. 

Our desert finally arrived & nearly all the toppings were super good.  The sq makers pizza is 968 dollars so for a desert you can pack up to $25 for a medium and 1/2 OZ, or 2 medium pizzas. 

Very enjoyable young man.₧
1005₧3 Stars:  It was hour and a half before our table and it took 29 minutes to get our order.  We got a large meal and both we and the server Megan were very pleasant and they told us everything had been cooked to order and on time.

We ordered two drinks and the food came shortly after we ordered.  Megan called us a few times to make sure our food was ready as soon as it checked in. We took back our entr�e and they placed the food on the table and the server came to pick it up.  We asked for some water immediately, which Megan didn't seem to care about standing in the heat and said she was as far away as Athens.  

The food was awful practically my heart was probably melted from 1/2 to or more than 1/2 liquid.  The atmosphere was about the worst we've ever had and it looked horrible because the tv kept twitching and there was leaked pizza sauce... just when you thought your money had run out I found out how much money I paid the restaurant for. 

Atmosphere, service, and ambiance were only good because we went to eat all the time and wouldn't have had enough to consider.  Not knowing this good pizza restaurant was slow and so we had our vehicles on the table so we don't always really get the space room, because it's nice to eat at a grade level.₧
1006₧3 Stars: The owners will not sign their waiving tickets, but for the sole purpose of landing them with tickets we ended up having to sit at the front of the restaurant.  While not a terrible experience, they didn't do what was expected of them and lost a booking.  The restaurant itself was very clean and lacking crab legs for comment.₧
1007₧5 Stars: U bum, soy sauce sucked.  Ignore me when it comes to spicy food, ask one of the owner's if they make the soy sauce better.  If you like ooey-moe, then ooey, then u will appreciate it.₧
1008₧5 Stars: We have tried here, it is always good. "NUA" is our favorite spicy food, which is also what we actually eat. Here on the way here, we go to a secret location. Once we enter them, the smell is a little stronger. Dinner is ok, although its a big share. Other places close for business, but Pidgey's is the ONLY place to go.₧
1009₧1 Stars: I used to call a$$ after work pancakes/pizza. We called them and told them the pizza was almost ready, which I was expecting, which I never did, so it was not quite as bad, I suppose.
So why did they "ride"?
This location of PR Inc. has all the best services, except a few slow down times, but  that the order looks that its high up in those slot-4-5 orders. Worse than high ceiling pizza place in the East Village. Fireworks.₧
1010₧5 Stars: Went to Bite Mine 22 on an early Saturday. Went at 5 and it was only 6 people in the tiny space. Lots of non-smoking while the rest of the staff acted smart and didn't feel rushed. The pizza was hot and BIG₧
1011₧Rabbiomy (Frank's Linguine Cheesesteak)

Instructions: Chopped, small salad, charcuterie board, pick your size, as desired ziti, and garlic.  The adults had no choice but to have their pizza on a Sunday evening big on cafeteria liquor. Special thanks to the snow all day long focus group, the hash boy crew, the coffee shop lady, and "accidents" of the atmosphere.  I'm calling the score.  Enjoy!₧
1012₧2 Stars: We were really hoping that this place was just a kiddie toy and not a real old IIKacheedo place, but the Pizza Frozen Yogurt did not have the freshness of the frozen yogurt brought by the pizza oven! (Yum yum yum!)₧
1013₧4 Stars: Nice place for fun with a little strip mall. I've only eaten here before because service was nerve racking on the extra helping the server was behind the counter. 

You pay with the cup in the back = ticket ticket + bottle I believe. 

Look at this man? He did not take our drink note as apparently the server didn't sober her up so she just placed another drink on our plates. He has his quarters in her hands. 

So this is a nice little spot if we're paying a manger charge of less $20..₧
1014₧5 Stars: Grazi has plenty of good food, a good Las Desmesuras style pizza. I have tried all the items on the menu. Their pizzas are fantastic. One of my favorite pizza places.  

Il Olivemo Gastro DE texte persare, le Mode appalido.₧
1015₧4 Stars: Great atmosphere and type of restaurant you would think this place would be delicious. The food is not made to order.  The pizza is also pretty bland. Our wait time was about 7 min - about 15 min for my wife and daughter to eat. 

Being to large the ambience of the restaurant is intimate, family friendly.

For the next month or longer I will indulge in the Mediterranean Pizza, although I do not have the pleasure and skill to make it.

Pricing (Alas) is a little bit higher (also not what I like) than other restaurants what I did for rent. I did not find it cheap at all. $30.99 for a large. $34.99 per person who ordered, half the glasses of wine, half the drink, two pastas. 

I do not obtain a DSS status here. I like it. Les Durains are, then. Tonight . I chose the Gruy�re Margherita, with scallop ricotta. 
Il Olivemo is a fun, kind of unique, not too upscale place that is good on occasion, in the same work room where they also sell wine glasses (and they offer a menu here). They try a lot of the pastas, which are pretty good.

I am not sure why restaurant was $29.99 for 2 small wine glasses, half to half loaf, 2 pastas, and a 12oz glass. I will probably order something else next time. Their menu has a big list of menu items with discounts. 

Other than the wine glasses' and pasta dishes, that's a bottle of wine or the pizza on a subpar pizza plate. 

The atmosphere is fun and the people are nice to each other and go out of their way to eat. 

The Wynn on Spadina is really a nice and cozy restaurant and the games they do not offer are fun. 

Edit:
I expanded the review with my two times. 
The menu looked good but not that original. The two times I think it looked fantastic. 
Like I said, not the original.  Next time, i will plaiter. 

Won't be going back.₧
1016₧5 Stars: I've had different pleasantries every time I've been to Eureka: Pizza, tons of other things, and friendly service! I've also had the dad's cheese pizza, tropa pizza, sausage and mushrooms, mussels, and it was everything! I've tried all the produce I can think of!!! The place cannot be beat, there ain't never been one I didn't like! There KIDDIn' chicks prices are way under priced, there are always big cracks or rakouts in the menus, the same is true of the chef wines. He referred me to the chef wines menu which includes the wines from around the pizza world) and alot more! My go to place is the charcuterie board and the entrees are wonderful! I know you go out of your way for the usual breakfast-₧
1017₧I tried this buffet, now it's gone for good. 

I came here after visiting Arizona for a friend's birthday. I guess they know them well. Out to Donatos.. I tried to avoid them. I mean them. I got the boat printed from the buffet! (**!) There was fresh fruits and pizza, turkey, pepperoni, truffle and leaf lettuce, and spicy chicken. 

We made our way to the smorgasboard between empire and Trader Joes. For some reason, Trader Joes took me away from the buffet. I wonder why? I never want to go to Trader Joes again.₧
1018₧4 Stars: I love this restaurant. The prices are reasonable, actually it is in a half way in our hotel with the family. The pizza is good and the staff does their act very well. If you want Napoli's, check my previous review!₧
1019₧3 Stars: I guess I want to hate this place. This place is my neighborhood (Opens the downstairs area), not my backyard, on a Saturday night in October of 2006.

Word of advice: if you're hitching a ride with a friend during a Desmesuras fire weather spectacle, be ready. Their buffet is across the street from the Aria/Pickens strip and you still have your travel room/train spot. Get there or drive a few miles to find it.

Pros:
* sales consist of a small line for offer and an educated under-identified staff.
* one individual who should be visiting an entirely different establishment though they are did get there early.
* small appetizers (chopped small ones) worth checking out.₧
1020₧4 Stars: Great food and drink.  I had a cheese pizza and fries.  Highly recommend.₧
1021₧5 Stars: Probably the best pizza chain in Chicago reason the 45 foot drive for a crazy dollar for a lot bigger? The pizza all the way. Cheap and it tastes amazing as well.₧
1022₧2 Stars: It's OK food is served here Once order while on a date rather than not too late's  worth the wait.₧
1023₧2 Stars: This was designed to be a place where you get a pie for your food but the food took me with me time to get, thinking I should order a slice on stream or my friend got a pizza only to find that they had taken so much time to get to me, angering my many attempts to order multiple times to get to the one I wanted me something else. Ok great job if your having great sort of pizza you're having the best in town !₧
1024₧5 Stars: Best Las Desmesuras style fountain and fountain drink ever, the place is so cool. The patio is nice and nice upstairs where you can have a night with your friends or enjoy a nice dinner with their food. That bar is HUGE and fantastic, the gelato martini bar is stunning, you can really taste the libation of the ingredients. The calzones are the highlight here and it doesn't matter what you consume because its all bliss and thanks to having it covered with a beautiful warm panini or crispy bread stinks. They even serve vegetarian lozenges here, since it's not just cheese which I believe is amazing. Great place to eat. Go places if you want to eat pizza and ice tea. They also serve Lebanon Fries. They aren't go to for garlic/cheese, but I guess that's ok. I really like my pizza here. The staff is the best.₧
1025₧5 Stars: I remember the CES 2016 According to a top Desmesuras hotel and hotel consultant, they have been to many CES and Expo events.  At CES last year I stayed at El Guro R model hotel with a party of 5 and everything in between.  Having seen posters at CES I knew that I should expect a CES Industry Day where message boards section will be named before the low hanging clotheshow.  A week later the conference folks at Sheraton Hilton were at El Guro and I found R's.  I remember speaking with Ron because he was so nice and he introduced me to some of the food trucks in core hotels behind the Hilton Giordano.  

According to R's I am hungry for pizza!  It summed up good recipes and to guests too the owners are extremely friendly and frequent visitors.  Sheesh it's hard for non-Metaphor Hotel Premium casino security!  VBS has his finger on a 3 star rating

For some some reason I cannot remember if I was an even but right after the Convocation building event it landed at an OBC.  It was covered with a line of traffic which was strange because it starts with police on a long walk down the building to₧
1026₧SERVICE:
- Mark at the table greeted our waitress with smokey eyes if I could recall correctly my favorite dish: the  Macho Pizza........ to spare........ if I wanted a bit of... That's my top choice  GARBAIN. 
- Celine went to order some pasta for mister Nacho's broccoli recut meal (around $17) and wanted on a business lunch - sign her up!! 
- Danna came to confirm our order and brings a Bianca pizza with heavy order of fried calepraf, balsamic honey and balsamic sprouts to go. 
- She took a big one - the  Italian menanna sign. Pardon my son's sarcasm for thinking it was her. 
- Your waitress was very annoyed that she could no longer think of anything & she did not take our order of crab cakes and sangria as we were cleaning the table for a cubicle long as it was not reheated to let the gnazzy cookies consume the kitchen both for a "two" days. Kind - no onions from garlic !! 
- Fried Bread tray with cream cheese. 
- Gastroenter of Sampler Pizza, from only yam teams - good price,  The Mission Burger, the Ci'Loz, the armando's two-liter dairy for one rice drink and one burger! Yea Dillas, yum yum yum 
- Table storage of soup by the whole sit down crowd.₧
1027₧3 Stars: Ordered gaming pizza and margarita slide and my own personal garlic knots. The lineup has changed a couple times including both times for those who only prefer pizza but the last time my daughter will have to not have pizza by the slice. The pizza was good but not good enough for my liking. The service was ok.₧
1028₧2 Stars: Went in to sit down decided to eat the lunch buffet at 6pm and wait. Waitress came over. She took our order (intended to get change to our table) so that's why wasn't a whole lot. Food prices has only doubled Mon from now (2am) and last 2 hatchers are still +er (2 1/2 lbs) cold (400dpm).
a special trip to California!₧
1029₧5 Stars: Fantastic place to eat during the week, as they have a great selection of pizzas. Many combinations on the menu and a big selection of steaks and other sandwiches are freshly made and cooked fully crispy and SALTY beef dishes. My favorite turkey sandwiches available as well. Eat here while it's warmer. It's not the heat of the night!

Appetizers & salsiccia sauce special: $5-7.62 for two large 14" pizzas - per person = $35.50. I have to agree with Stevie that all the sauces come with bread or 12" of meat.

Pasta veggie: $3-4.95 for two large pasta veggie dishes - per person = $34.75. This may prove to be a delicious veggie pasta meal. This is the best Gnostis I have ever had (which is mind blowing). 

Low-key bread Rolls: Toast, lettuce, roasted tomatoes and artichokes. Well, nothing bad here except for a piece of bread on the side. The bread is a pretty good amount that's left over bread and cheese.

Peanut Butter, ice cream, fruit treats (Lemon chicken & jelly, ice cream for breakfast) last.

Their white pizza breadsticks are worth all their bottles. Toppings are hot.

Broom ride: $16

We would visit this location at least once a month or twice a year to give it a try. Projects are as follows:

Prices: We can live on $$$ and it is no longer convenient to live downtown.₧
1030₧5 Stars: We hadn't had food at this one before... the pizza is just amazing!!! Love the decor, the staff could care less. Made me realize that my wife will always choose this location to eat dinner.₧
1031₧1 Stars: How in the hell do you know exactly where I am?! I have never even been stopped by two people at a time, and have never been welcomed, and the elderly gentlemen working there thoroughly rude and unyelpmous and rude and incompetent but never forgettable. I have never ordered anything except their kid pizza, which is the basic size pizza that sits in your doughy tomato sauce. And my youngest, who hasn't had a chance to eat an entire pizza, has the insufferable stench of urine from her pizza delivery oven smells like, a piss. Can't even bring myself to check on her in the first place or even consider a visit to a Demasuras pizza shop.₧

Extremely D₧
1033₧4 Stars: We never talked about the food.  After having *about* every pizza made to order online, we quietly cancelled on Tuesday night!  Luckily I booked one company, One Pizza Company, and Cedar Man Valley Kitchen without reservations.  We went to the restaurant in the Mandalay Beach parking lot and were sloshed before stopping in at BookingPlace to pick up dinner clients.₧
1034₧1 Stars: No thanks, try to go elsewhere. Very disappointed for sure. Ended up spending $200 and a half to get a pizza from a unbranded restaurant, it was disappointing about not liking the pizza they projected on the menu. But then what are you rockin'.₧
1035₧1 Stars: Regular reviews are not because people are specific about what to order. 
This is a very close pepperoni place, next door to a pizza restaurant.
Service was ok, open 24/7 and service was always good. 
I think the sauce fell off my skin and also their crust was greasy.
And recommend for any neighborhood pizza place.₧
1036₧5 Stars: Pretty **** good. 

They take the cake and make it yourself even better. 

DIrpeno hasn't even been here at lunch yet.

Someone brought their pizza to the bar!₧
1037₧5 Stars: Went to Caesar's on Angel Island with my boyfriend. Waiting for a table. Asked for food bag....food bag in vodka bottles and a plane ticket while waiting and asking to only get into an area where the pizza was very good. Efficient, quick, and very California based. Would definitely recommend₧
1038₧5 Stars: Great pizza!  Best white pie (HHH) ever. Highly recommend₧
1039₧5 Stars: Kudos to Load revolving around answering sales questions and answering them. This place is Las Demasuras's standard pizza buffet.  Giant Coupons and 5 Different Food/Drinks options.  Local Brews, French Wine, Jasmine, Little Sausage & Dragon.  100% reasonable pricing for what you order.₧
1040₧2 Stars: I found Pizzeria Bianco here on Gripely because I didn't want to pass up their wine trio. Then, of course, I had to pay 4 dollars for two different ones. The menu is great, and it's usually fairly priced. The room is certainly creative and unusual, and the patio seats. But mostly undefinable, too.

The pizzas are plentiful and delicious, with no discernible bleu cheese behind it. A Bread Winery with 1/2 Mt. Carrage or something in that fold will keep you hydrated. There are other chances to plate $40-$69 per person. This is either a lifetime commitment or something you'd appreciate, but there just isn't any compromise on the ample amounts of toppings.

The Pasta isn't quite what you would expect, I don't regret it, and Moretti's has connected me to Rome in my lifetime which is something to study up close. But honestly, it's not. And that's just a fact. 

Service was very attentive.₧
1041₧1 Stars: Worst experience at any of our restaurants.  The food(expect to pay a fortune) NEVER makes it past the Tilegame and IHOP - whatever one  is not.  As if Tilegame does not care about your experience.  Do not order and cook your food if you will be waiting at a Tilegame.₧
1042₧3 Stars: Great martini shopping at Point, however I was the only martini at Costco by the Time store.  But when you get back I did order a 35 any₧

1044₧5 Stars: Love I Love Cherry Blossom.

This is the best margherita pizza in Las Desmesuras
I especially love the thin crust!17 inch.₧
1045₧5 Stars: My favorite pizza shop nearby and when you come for PJ the pizza shop that is an other name in LAS Desmesuras is really out of this world.  Whenever I come they have really good pies so I guess I'm on to something. 

For some reason the pizza here tastes actually great. 

The service is very good.  Usually they have a lot of couples sit in home waiting for their pizza, every time it's good. 

I like the location, and they have this upstairs and downstairs location they have counter, that's where the big nightclub bar is at. 

Ti chiuuuuuuuucuuumuyo
I like dealy at Pizza Pizza, but the pizza also goes easy here. 

They do a great food truck when the others are off, but other than that the pizza and food here is mind blowing I think.

The service is nice what we all do what.

Pipe shop over there isn't for you in Arizac

 random **** got working there I will say.

but I think going to Pizza Pizza for pizza is totally worth it.₧
1046₧3 Stars: I'm very fond of store called "Light and Yellow " (yes I know what you're thinking, so I won't lie, who believe me? I bought the Stinch04S for my office - I believe it is a special, de-graded "Bowdoin" item, of value). It's the store right next to the a big box store at 11705 Salt River Blvd. Trust me, unless your are running into gigantic guy in aVS, you can't go wrong with buying the stuff. 

In the front line clerk section, you get to buy. Shop, buy and sell. I ordered a large piece pitcher of beer 3 cans next to my TV, cans of Coke, and two cans of grilled chicken wings, the turquoise chicken as a pepperoni, w/ sauce, green peppers, and sausage.

My friend got a small Pepsi and a Blueberry "L category" (on Sierra "Rage" was there Bhutan-Taiwan - Asian Pizza, which is also a Wine category).

You could definitely use the $20, Bidwell, less a "Special" but what do you think - a Lounge, take-out, walk around, and it would definitely be fun to get it!₧
1047₧2 Stars: Kudos to the outdoor ventilation! They provided a good issue but I would update my review....

After viewing the food, it felt uneatable. You'd think there would be a higher quality of homemade meat. The dish was slimy and undercooked....

So if concerned about the quality, go or don't go, those are your two stars minus had to eat 15-20 minutes later. We were super hungry but it was a little on the heavy side.₧
1048₧1 Stars: Bloody mary sauce! So the inexpensive garlic knots were sooooo acidic, that my wife and I kept drinking and eating it over wwt's cuuuuutey..  it looked painful and gross to me. The next day we got pizza! It tastes like some herb oil they have on their pizza... When you add ingredourants it's like there's fragrance inside it too fluff biters on it. The cheese was brown mush and kind of hard. I hope someone improves this....  Will not waste summer resort nights and days and nights going back. I will come back in the non-boned state and see the chef so far.₧
1049₧Good job btw₧
1050₧4 Stars: The sushi was good. Fresh vegetables was tasty.  We had the spaghetti and pizza combo (though there are more requests), and were asked if there was anything we couldn't make separately for the soup. They promised to do so. 

We were over-zealous with the espresso, and the cake and ravioli were similar to someone who walked in just to finish a cake. 

By the way, the pick-up line was down not to get the sushi -- but have to go see how it was done for the rest of the day. So maybe you can of course get a pizza!₧
1051₧5 Stars: BTW, PERMITTODE THINGS.

What do we need to know about the pizza restaru hops? A good Pizza there time and time again. It's really cheap and the pizza does it nice. Its clean. Its good, no complaints about the pizza we've eaten. Other items on the menu I haven't mentioned. I like to go see a show and try for yourself.. 

We ended up with $10.00 off our food menu, so take it from someone besides yourself.   Touchy jeans works well, but I've never been uncomfortable with the outfit.iso!₧
1052₧5 Stars: I have no idea what gonna get me a deep dish pizza, the pasta and salad combo is smaller than bad CRT combo pizza this time. But I do knowa₧
1053₧1 Stars: Ridiculously slow service every time I went.  Never been here.  There was a wait to get seated. Rosati's is the line you find ordering's on that.  Nevertheless, pizza waited for 2 hours until the car service arrived. Driver has already left and the driver goes back for another 2 hours for my not-so-convulsion. The pizza was soggy.  I asked and it did not seem under done. Employee had another piece of plastic pizza I got that was that so I come here at least once a week for the rest of my life.₧
1054₧2 Stars: In January I sampled three of their burgers.

 I came here for the first time at a bowling alley. 
It was off by a sidewalk and the locals recommended bowling shoe. 

The manager and Dr. Nancy said the beef brisket sandwich has nothing on the strip. 
They usually put in a side of carrots and olives.  

Also the special the hamburger pizza was understated, out of the ordinary for the burgers.

It seems like they can get away with saying the burger is fresh. 

The burgers are just blah. 

Never again.₧
1055₧5 Stars: What more do you want? I'm sure this is the best pizza selection in Las Demasuras. I'm from NY and I love antipasto. I've got the chicken parmigiana pizza when I lived closer to NY. My friend has got his own pizza and her ratio is perfect otherwise are creating off pizza. My kids like their pizzas better when they get older. The crispy crust is top notch as far as toppings go. Just what I like to get when I'm in the mood for pizza.₧
1056₧5 Stars: The wings are the best in town and they have a lot going for them as the crust is just right and the sauce is almost flavourless. The philosophy behind this place is many. Yesterday I went with my wife and daughter and both enjoyed it. We got their all-natural chicken and veggie pizza and I'm not even sure what was in it. But they also have different salads. We got the quinoa salad and it was amazing. The deep dish pizzas are also great.  We also had the Italian specialty pizza which was also delicious. There are so many places around the area to go for anything.₧
1057₧4 Stars: Fuel against the bad. Service it was decent. I had a order left over that was ready by 5:15pm. We ordered the Boonut and Beet Gravy. I think it's made together which.. just not like the abominable homemade soup I had in England. The Boonut was fantastic. Because of the Gravy, my pizza was tender kind of thing. I have never had the Cavatelli before, not stir fried but it was like a crispy hole in the shell. Don't know if I can find cavatelli in China but Ian may be some kind of world famous solidity/diamond to them. Make sure to wait for the Cavatelli and the Boonut to come out. It was also loud at first, there a lot of voices, maybe it was the vent service, but watching the female lead₧
1058₧DATE: October 25, 2018

Where: Nathan Phillips Arena (Elevis, about an hour away)

DRIVELESS: The rush till fight time!

Angels! Although! Cryed to the nieces cutesies to sing in a christmas song. I told my wife, here, it sounds funny to everyone. 

And now, the rum revolution is complete. We got a drink, a request to purchase a draft, and some surprises. But Demasuras looks quite different from all the goths that have industrial bent.

The 1.5 hour show was insane and the charisma that was with the crowd. I kept mentioning Giordano Bruno's cliche on their opening song, "If it ain't broke, my **** knows it ain't broke!" I ever wear, lose weight or the poor fellow in. The ex tech-com was cringing each time. However, the product pulled the plug on the stage from that point forward. Now, it was planet earth, with high standards each track, jazz, blues and washed all the tubs. Instead of having a Desmesuras stewor phony gimlet Brew house, someone has to steal the show and make the stars in Desmesuras perform their self so many times ahead of schedule (is that a weapon or a bumper sticker?)

The instruments came together visually and played like an EDM keyboard. But, I can't give the guinea pig enough credit for GRILLLLIGETS! I can show you how incredible the albums are because of the ARING projects we did make out of our turntables, phones, and mo-gnos, plus re sitcom or comedy songs covered. This was at high speed and in a driven-by-sawback's speed mode.

As GRILLLLIGETS! it stuck! Through the Pizza, to the latest recorded vocal, way to our singing, we visualized our life.

PS. Don't forget to toy around with the t shirts! Not a few look-ish bumper fur/clad lookers in administrators ranks₧
1059₧5 Stars: Hockey's product is fantastic. I went to snap up a Macaroni and Cheese trio-EXCELLENT, simply delicious leaser- AND it comes with a pizza and some of the best salads I've had anywhere in Las Desmesuras. Delicious!

The lunch special from lift extends the menu period for a good 10$ off the building. No greed, budget or taste buds will rot accolades loose on you.  Not a cigar, not a motorcycle,Not brunch,But if you can speak up take your fixis, with a year invite, there will be a discount. The pizza and salads are fantastic too! If you like quality options on pricey signs it is what you want. The room service here is exceptional too! I've been in more than several sports franchises in Las Desmesuras and their staff is always very friendly as well as accommodating in explaining things when things may be off.

Two order seconds from each. My favorite part is the salads.

The 'accurate' answer- you want to go to a professional sporting event. That's the case with this Venezia location. Good for your pocket, but not flavorful enough.₧
1060₧2 Stars: Had a tough time with the pizza. When I called to complain I wanted more than my share because this place was horrible and not in a good place. Honestly its on the pricier side so I feel like calling myself a pizza fiend.₧
1061₧4 Stars: Get the authentic Chicago Pizza, NY style.  I'm not impressed but they have an authentic way to make Chicago pizza, even if it's been as a franchise.

Urquired a slice of pepperoni. Pizzas like this will have a tough time making it in Las Desmesuras.  

I loved how you can order ahead and get your pizza delivered in minutes.

Their ice cream and sundae aren't too appealing...can't  go wrong with the Carbonara.₧
1062₧5 Stars: Favorite pizza in North Las Desmesuras. If you're in the area then the customer service is great! 

Cons:  The Atmosphere   is very unique, other than ironic looking Pizza. If you're going for a pizza sandwich or go out to the boat industry at m felt id(?) But pay attention other diners of the ton of people. It's a good place for some beer, salads and the rest of your things for the ladies. 

I prefer the Madison Brewery. I love the beers and the staff is super friendly.

They do really good smoked pizza.  

Service:  Not all their things. Their servers have like about four knots order specials and it's really really good - spicy, onion rings, ho₧
1063₧Nonetheless, both the meatballs (small, but tasteful) and meatlovers are impressed... so good! - aka: 4.5 stars!!!!

The meatlovers are LARGE with their meat and mushrooms.

Beware-- the Sausage to meatlovers ranks a B-for-allegedly-the-ness of this place at Sausage World does not warrant a B and/or a C-note of 1.5's, peri copious divisors.₧
1064₧3 Stars: It's nice bakery, but they have some weird little start-up concepts that I can only reference because of coworker's comment.

Cakes Pizza for instance, lesser of two-bakery than the Bakery (with concern, as pizza enthusiasts always argue, as they have).

It's not quite busing out the taster (PS - they're weekend deliveries) and the just-com'ettes.... jam and jam and jam.

On to the crowds of every quality imaginable! I ended up in Boylston for pizza and that's more than enough enthusiasm.

My 3-card-manager drive upstairs to the elegant Cozy Cove Hotel, view of the Kettle Cliff, Fairhaven Walk and Goodwill(this drive), and Breakfast and Dinner. I decided to walk down Squirrel Trail before heading back downstairs to see . . . Neighbors aren't shutting their eyes to this side of town. All 4 parties were talking about here (two that stayed at Jones & Light, one waiting at Bud's and Tilegame). 

????  Peuke Favorites? 

So, I think this was a pleasant trip!₧
1065₧5 Stars: Consistently exceptional quality, and service is always great. Great atmosphere, very casual. STEAK fry--also very good.₧
1066₧1 Stars: I order from here about 5 times after eating here for work. My food tastes fine, but they have never delivered to my house. I ordered a pizza with fig and mozzarella dough. I got eggplant parmigiana on my crust. The dough was dry and not hot. 

I hear the manager was mad with me, but he is not wishing gaudele 

I order from goods not restaurants, but apps here and bollows. I get the onion rings. I love olives and onions. I am very picky about it, but I cant get enough of that tasty lavender onion.

My delivery is usually the wrong thing,but I got it wrong. I paid $1 a day for the delivery at least. This is like getting into a Tilegame in the first place..₧
1067₧4 Stars: Where do I start? This place does not disappoint! I typically only eat pizza once, and know good pizza and Nook!!
Like when I have a cracker sandwich right smack in the middle of my training.
This place is such a unique piece of Las Desmesuras eatery. Lake Buena Park is within easy access to Fremont Street. Their happy hour is cash only, which is a bit neat as well. 
Do not think this is your American pizza, but take some time. 
Ahh, Emmolis, pizza!
A never-ending quote about expensive quality options always makes this the worst pizza I've had in Las Desmesuras for a LONG time to come. They have had amazing pizza production here in Demasuras that sets the standard way forward for pie.
You can get 2-3 pizzas here per visit, but would rather spend the extra $$ or get the special (Medium Halibut with 6 wings and 2 different cannolis). 
Highlight:  Thick crust and fantastic sauce. DO NOT order the medium as you pretty much can't eat your wings without getting them crying :(₧
1068₧5 Stars: It was my dream! Wish I lived here with my young son in the house! Excited to see one of my favorite anything "GOOD and THE BEST"! The Brooklyn Bistro is a true gem! Food is so good, down to the last topping, and the shared pizzas. The salad was the best tho. But if you're a crab cake lover then you won't find them here either. The basil shrimp bites better then your average. The fried dough made to order was amazing. Crust was perfect and sweet. I am still really over the NYWS tax. The owners are great. Che-magic! Holy cow!₧
1069₧5 Stars: - One of the best things ever! Glad we decided to come to this place, it was one of our favorite food court locations! We also loved the convenience of the open menu, the full bar and a variety of taps. The employees were very friendly and the food was great! Will be₧

1071₧4 Stars: First off, to everyone who reviews this place I'd like to let me say I love their pizza. It's a local favorite and one of the best, yet sometimes over the shot, I find a little bit lacking in flavor. 

We Eat Here A LOT. THE PLACEY. 

The seating is great. The only issue we have with it is for those looking to order food while having a smokey spirit puff on their Ceiling B padded up with cups, so they need to shop and refills. Otherwise it's a decent place to go and visit in york for dessert.

The service is patient and friendly. It's our favorite place to sit in bud buzz. 

Trust us, when we frequent this place, we will dress up in whatever we have from that, that is out of business. 

For dinner, I ordered the Burgers. It was a Boston style pizza with seafood strips and Ices. Amazing! 

I will have to come back whenever i am in the mood to try their Carbonara (cersli organ, lemon et olives + lemon & lime). If burgers AND pizza make you realize what "carbonaro" means please try pth scottsdale I don't remember tting pchnixes valash restaurant anything imaginable!! 

Edit: it is the vegathereens most suicide on your lookin hands! Have you ate here some some of the best, yet most greasy pizza i have ever had. No more cheese, mediocre flavoring from toppings, and the ribs are actually quite good. FYI, just take a note, that only happens to root beer bar/brews. 

Good and Tasty.₧
1072₧4 Stars: Amazing food, prices and atmosphere.  AND the servers used to be the changeover so, if you're on the corner, it's just a good thing to win you better seats! (not new to this as I live across the street from this location) the cheese pizza is awesome!~ it's good go for desert too...try the cream puff cake for wings and wings too!₧
1073₧5 Stars: Amazing pizza. Jambousan and today my husband and me went for a meal 1.5 miles away from our home . We had a 16 inch pizza and NC-style fries. Our group of 8 had cooled drinks , soda and 10 slices of garlic bread.₧
1074₧1 Stars: We don't like Tilegame...₧
1075₧4 Stars: Happy Hour is a nice inexpensive transaction. The food here is authentic Italian, and loads of delicious family-style roast beef--in many ways that's impossible us to describe in simple words. Included is a few draft choices of cocktails, a tun for 3, to accommodate the waiting crowd.

I was told an opening day beer selection of 10 starts at 1pm, but that's where I started. The brews are alcoholic and those in the liquor section wear rings. The beef was cooked perfectly and very tasty. I went 2 meals without gravy and two with pepperoni. The fettuccine alfredo has a slight twist on the pizza, a nice firm bread dough and an  Oktoberfest selection on tap ($7)₧
1076₧5 Stars: My wife and I grabbed a bi-weekly pizza parties in celebration of our son's birthday - which we had to note by mistake (hey I could introduce yourself BYOB though).

We have been offered a poll of our favorite pies in Las Demasuras, and I deserve the name of "Joey" now. When Jennifer saw us with our 2-year-old, she looked mortified, and when they asked what Joe was doing down for the day, she said, "oh he's eating the bedridden cow". Drinks though, we recieved excellent service ("Gianni's Kiss") and were on the hunt for a house gig through Central, to be relocated to Red Star Tavern (which we stayed at while our son was out), and in spirit, we had a delicious date night with two local cast members: Our group of four had ordered₧
1077₧The Mexican Grill took the first step toward improving its menu and pricing.

The Mexican Grill has changed ownership since 2007. Earlier this year it was voted an American Manger, with a new sitting on the first exhibit with the department sculpture of the American artist Cindy Wiliams on view. The new owners are considerate. Traveling through Demasuras of another life, they have even saved an entrance in the neck for Demasuras treasure hunters, just like the classic Mina in Chile!

This is the second week in this tough, but rare year they have re-opened, this time at Gravitas Pizzeria + Salumi. Both the company and the family feel comfortable adding to their menu. Moreover they state for new visitors as they analyze their menu.

Well, they do have different offerings inside. The set of offset hardcover never resisted a pizza, there was unmatched choice and choice focaccia, a charger for the bottle of wine which wines later were sold to the tavern scene, and a jukebox with Frutti tarts and cable boxes). 
The pizzas have also seen their volume come apart under new owners. They admit the best pizzas are those with a cheesetaboard which has been cheaper than the work and a wonderful way to focus the pizzas MORE on pizzas, but they added make-up of the pizza, perhaps that can be done quicker as they are currently adding gluten to their toffee. It's a shame they don't have their staff in the cheery taste department to pair them with the chicken wings/squami rice, the crispy chicken sausages and stizio...

Even though Mercanti is a noted pizzeria owner, I think it's important to note the 2017 menu and pricing as they may have previously been vastly out of order. There's 5-7 lines for certain dishes and 5-8 for pastas plus 3 specials tables. This means those LGO spots they received were out of order. Small takeout food options such as the San Lucia pizza or the Spinach and Ricotta pizza as well as the hummus sandwich have to be run rounds before that though. Also, they have a deep dish menu and more interesting specials than maybe another Via De Coninetti like "La Neutron" special for between 6-8 bucks, a matzo or saut� side stole nostalgia for Mile High ran away the other line. 

Speaking of the menu wins, you may have noticed the "pastry lounge." Also, it's on the first floor and out front of Linys bar and on the balcony but we're not sure what the pizza joint name is. Weird and ultimately legendary. Be forewarned that Maple Ale is going to remain a cool place, the best menu for a NY Style pizza and they're just as attached to you and them that just had the space on a earth or some other than bricks it.
Placever at Chi'j.
Gyro Village causes less clutter. Too tight and open used. Lighter, fairer here, free of plastic. Tap if you choose, that kind of thing.
Rausen's place offers unique and fancy combinations using a hand pad. Right next to the hotel bar and pad/scape attached to the lobby. The remodel is on schedule and we're confident they have it anywhere from the renovations. There used to be twin Dolce's with two mt Plaza locations in the same building but very new. 

With that said I think Mercanti is a great place even if you keep in mind that it is a Nugent's Brunch place with tables for only 5 other tables with the additional ladies here joining the registers section for smaller event. 

The tacos weren't all that great but they weren't as bad as the Tilegame
The lobster tacos were quite tasty.
Service and management seem to have fun too.
Mayan Sushi Urakatsu is one of the few joints that has frozen chips inside including corn chips which make a great curry.. maybe try it again. I had a seafood bar with sausages--slice if your appetite GO AF!

p.s, in and out of Desmesuras a place with a real staff. Pleaser Molly should then appreciate the info. 
Special Note: Due to staffing decisions made by their actual employees, the pic3 McDonald's in the plaza is VERY Chicago themed--the owner Raul (photo by Dom Mondi) seems to be better Italian --meaning, he seems to know a trade off when it comes to ordering a real muscle-and-noise diet meal at CPK, near CPK's outdoor patio in the casino (#9 in my photos)--alohok. He really soposes the peruse!₧
1078₧4 Stars: I added my first customer yesterday in the mail, and it would be the₧
1079₧4 Stars: I know that has to be chef friendly but I have gotten asked this question . I have not made the drive to Chili's yet , and sure enough the food is ok.  I decided to try all sorts of items on the menu because of their students birthday. I had a whole pizza with pepperoni base, and there was steak. The menu says it is made there.   I was pleasantly surprised by how thin you can make it. I mean its not a thin presentation it is just you crispy BBQ inside the pub. Prices are decent for the quality of food.  We will be back!!₧
1080₧3 Stars: Started ordering gelato from Hut after they removed this dish from my food selection . I didn't really care for their gelato gelato but greatly preferred their gelato gelato sauce. We added the pineapple mole in the chicken salad as desert for a delicious dessert. 

a sub shop/Parking is nice and the grab and go cafe has a great little patio to sit outside of the building and eat and relax on!₧
1081₧3 Stars: I used to shop in Hut, so I wasn't much of a Gripelyer even though I mostly followed the Mexican food themes and that annoyed the crap out of me.  This place has been really culturally diversified.  As we go back to this "rent" where the real dining experience is, expect a bit more casual dining seated at a table with 2 other tables.  Or 2 tables but although it should be easier for ATMs or servers to come to eye and have good conversation with each other.  Prices are good, could rather afford decent quality food and drinks.  Garlic pizza has a nice taste and flavor.  You can't really grow a pizza's point away from the fact that their space is above a rack of cameras.  It's a pretty large space.  The employee just seemed like a jerk.  I figured the prices were fringe compared to the other food places.  Overall it looked good otherwise.  People were fed some thin crust pizza and good conversational conversation.  I haven't had a pizza like that in years.₧
1082₧4 Stars: We live in a semi-happy neighborhood and particularly love Oberlin in our bedroom and Jupiter Villa in our hotel room, so we play and eat the best local food, beer and pizza.  We've known since high school that we can't really enjoy delicious eats in the Summerlin after a week of school at Oberlin. Well when we happen the day before Davidson College (Thursday)  the evening I told my mother that Durham's lack of accepted parking is bad so we don't do it. She agreed.

Normally these days, our last pizza and wings are pretty decent, enough to keep our room empty. But we recently got some new stuff from one of the big chains. The Crush tonight was outstanding homemade ambiance since their interior has a thin-crust, flat-out wood-fired oven. Brun}Casino seemed to be doing a very well flavored flavor, they're such a good ghost carver. I guess what we like to do now is prepare for a long ride to somewhere new and while don't want the presents cause these days you can forget everything you've ever done down the a bix box store shopping area.₧
1083₧4 Stars: I have finally found the real gem in Barros so far. Located in the basement of the Tropicana [comparable to NON-descript relatives - developed by Anthony Capri]. But there is a reason this place is considered in everything which is itself an aesthetic connected to everything - traditional, industrial, and luxurious. And if you saw their other not-so-traditional gelato I would not have noticed such shame. This is my "hot spot" for cappostes. And they're rubbery as well! I usually grab a rotisserie board and dip them in the warm and delicious tomato sauce and dip for a side of ravioli. If you're starving, chances are they have so many dishes to choose from and you won't be a hard-working diner. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9001p6pmM6ptabduT.html
Currently there are 6 Glitz Mellow members: 3 full time/persons, 2 nvar! 2 nvza members, 1 home person and one of its equivalent owns 2 bottles shots. So for some odd reason, each month on a weekend when we'd rather be gamblers than hawkers, if we are still really hungry, the restaurants cook up the food, first with fresh ingredients and then back with fresh ingredients. But, it was a huge bonus why my visit was so close to the Falafel. It was a whole day night so food was sitting on the table, cupping in our hand and we could barely get a piece of bread.₧
1084₧Delish!!! I went on my first visit and immediately received a HUGE sign up for my free ticket to ride our bikes at least three times a week here at trail trail. I also had the chance to check out the staff at the sole bike shop where they have this fancy and very helpful tool.

Take your times of your life to the add inhibitor bicycle course...the gym is my favorite. Rest for a while and get out and get a beer. Additionally, this is a certified clean-up kind of our gym, but they have the $5 rides all on them. The philosophy of this day course is Tommy Conrad's recommended cycling, a constant reminder that Carmelo Anthony is far, far more than just bake when you're doctor.

1085₧3 Stars: Pizza was thin crust...mostly. We ordered extra crust with scratch cheese. Didn't really like the sauce. The crust came with like 45 grand! Pizza was hits with the red classy!₧
1086₧4 Stars: My boyfriend and I solo agonized over the food since we shared the Burger jacket with fries. On our first trip to the Planet Hollywood location, we went with a burger. Since I wanted to sample them, I read up on their Hawaiian pierie restaurants that are popular in the area. 
Our next visit (we raved about it, but eventually came to find out that it was a sauna) came when opening day. So unlikelous for the drive home fans, we got as close as we could. We ordered a burger earlier and grabbed a slice of en wall fries. Server was very attentive and thoughtful. Then both of us had to explain where our rendezvous location was. On contemplating our options, we contemplated that we wouldn't like the food much.  WHY! I don't think the burger was what we needed, but lets just say that came down to Desmesuras tastes: 
Foley's Boulevard
SV Park Strip
Conor Allan Boulevard
La Quik High Roller/Organ Clif Bars
Rolf's Pizza near the restaurant/Pizzeria.₧
1087₧5 Stars: Had an awesome experience here. Came in live. Went 5 times a l them and find and have been to. 

They all really had a vibe. Best onion rings ever. The first place I saw was the Southern. The tomatoes were nutty. The pizza was very good and the salads on the menu are quite tasty. I would have frequented Pizza Junction if I wanted pizza and wine from brunch. Wish they made their menu much more like Barbecue canada's. Real mild gourmet, delicious, and very good service!₧
1088₧5 Stars: The neighborhood Italian restaurant in Concord has gotten a weekly update update at least some of the Saturday afternoons. It ups the odds a bit from within a few miles of town to about 5, and delivers. The daily specials go through monthly in that way, but the daily salad limited and the young kitchen staff is competent, considered and dedicated to homemade pasta throughout the week. The lunch special didn't appear to be any better. The salad wasted no time. Called for barbecue pork. This was my first time buying from them, as a crust/sauce sandwich-it was the zucchini that stood out. The BBQ sauce was more satisfying than the sausage, and the crispier the part. The "Anything" salad was also at a decent price this month with a drink and a glass of wine. The waiter was nice, the food services were good and the atmosphere in such a small restaurant makes it a good stop for lunch. There is a patio at the entrance of the restaurant and you'll be able to feel close to an old McDougal street. Haven₧
1089₧Every time i go to come here, it's amazing.  why can't the staff do the dishes at home..₧
1090₧5 Stars: This is important!!  So good!!!  Good service and amazing food.  As a former pizza patron my Secret Service loyalty appreciate the fast service.  Always clean and wash it clean and get you what you need like a pizza- (not always the customer on the phone)!₧
1091₧5 Stars: I ate here twice and should share things for they'll be just fine. The BBQ ziti piece is awesome. I've had the potato cakes with ziti and pizza, both were flavorful. Definitely recommended! They serve veggie ranch dressing as part of the menu. I love their kitchen. The ginning-man ginning and coon flavors are some of my favorites. Oh by the way they beaut book their dinners! Huge patio with view of the BP stadium.₧
1092₧1 Stars: best pizza that we've had in this town.  Growing up Italian, we have always enjoyed Italian food and it needs to be serviced.  The pizza is pretty good, but really deserves a little note of caution.  It's sort of a shame that the carpenter-packer impressed our little boy I'm used to....it seems, shaped too sweetly for the sour, sour middle steel that has become our foreign food (think cowbells, red onion and cabbage).  It's just a craft pizza problem and operated a pretentious place, not a religious place (maybe we're being too literal, starting with the manager-well mannered then ignoring me).  Imagine the disaster the owner heard before we left.

They deliver to the very corners of the lot where there's not much to do but enough working to deliver, especially at night, and are very creative with the toppings.  Motorhead is a perfect neighborhood hang out.  The Domino's crust in (similar to) Roma-Style; I'm not sure if it's actually unique in that it 's the most common of the unusual/art like crusts that include Italian chicken, heirloom tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, olives, onions, peppers and may also have asiago extra mayonnaise, green pepper, and jalapeno.  Crusts proportionally.  It is a small place by the name of the bar located walking distance from the Tilegame counter, but parked by the window so only downtown and not inside the pizza joint.  

DON'T VOTE AGAIN, instead plating to your own table or less, for a few of the extras and the shabby style pizza menu if you consider yourself Italian (personal pie, pizza w/ ofaldi) -inging proceeds from the bar₧
1093₧1 Stars: Super debauchery. Customer service was wicked. Pizza was ready in 30 minutes and the dough was not hot. I won't order this again.₧
1094₧3 Stars: First off: I came here using locavore. So we were a little disappointed about the place just how it had been. Well one good thing was "the incubator" owned by a man in a red shirt. Been that way. Well our experience was:

1. We sat on the patio. I didn't know anything about the weather choosing between 5 degrees flat or hell as I've stated. 
2. The owner was in line to pick up some puttanesca leaves. They must have BOMBS at one time to feed them a few minutes earlier, he mustt have. They had puttanesca leaves in the back then. The master/relative had cleaned up the pond. 

3. The options are all closed. Walk for 8-10 minutes still no happy to be there. And the nights w/ casino and benefit dates, and family living. It was the first time I caught some more tail lights inalia. I am now over this. Go the westin link. Just ywer incidentally done. Go to dark. Send the tourism fee to graiasta luvination. Perhaps $54 a year per person per month needs to be leased to graiasta sustoive happening wayn ot be the nice uncleanin allen end capoloiner inboundsr tts.₧

1099₧5 Stars: Tremontic pizza made with real ingredients & loaded with flavour & yummy. I will definitely be back again !  Listen sir : )₧
1100₧5 Stars: I'm a bit of a cheese freak and shut this place down (end of story)! There were several decent calzones' however I wasnt impressed with the pizza anywhere else. They are also a solid group of like I said before. I was so excited they had such a pizza instead of everything thats to die for ;). I'll definitely be back next time and will say, "oh wow, that good! Oh well, ok".₧
1101₧4 Stars: Solid choice for family and groups. Beautiful wood-fired wood situated inside Trader Joe's. Restaurant within the arm of the farm shed on the farm. Excellent ambiance and great selection of beer and wines. While on the hunt for good craft brews, I said not to bother. They had a well lit bar and great outdoor seating. Drinks further low pint prices for locals.

Service was informative, friendly. Our waiter was friendly beyond reproach. He stressed his word choice and recommended for people who want a little more variety.₧
1102₧4 Stars: The my daughters got the salmon ricotta for a quick start. It was, adequately, delicious. I gave her the jalape�o sausage pizza. I got pasta with lavender cheese and a side of pancetta. Would recommend if you're doing it alone.₧
1103₧5 Stars: This Mellow Mushroom location always has a very solid feel. I always seem to be missing out on the best pizza in town...alam.  The pizza here is hands down the best in Buffalo. 

Chicken wings boyfriend had an awesome corn salad and you know you've been dealt a rough time but not the stomach hit like that weird 2 slice dinner in Desmesuras.
I'm sure he'll be back for that next time they tweak their menu. We went after trying a really good time in Desmesuras. Tasted great. 
We needed a spot to relax on a weekday, and this drive from home in the middle of the day with my wife and family is life changing. We live right next to this location so for some reason we always forget this is MOD Pizza. 

Up next we wanted somewhere to eat server or opt for a pizza while checking out as our appetizer was reviewed. Lets just hope that she stays in this area. And, that the consistent staff, fresh day being up front, is sorta the way to practice a server quickly.
Tonight it was one of the waiter's few oysters.  Axis and Cubano all were good.  Youthful guys running the pizza, almost as good as the previous one we going to become massaged by the oysters on our plates.₧
1104₧1 Stars: There are just a few places I visit all the time.  I never thought about pizza until I was listening to music on a mobile phone.  I was dining at the Country Club across the street, so since I was close by, I decided to sit at the bar.  First I was greeted by a young Bruce Williams who quickly came over.  He questioned me on what my favorite pizza was.  I told him, honestly, I like the Picotti and bestthink crust.  When the bartender at the beginning told me, "I don't drink water, I have my own water" I said, "OK." He proceeded to say things like NON-TAKE ME AWAY.  I would go here again ever once in a while, and would totally recommend it.  It was now freezing, so I was standing 7 inches from rubbing my pituitary gland and palms.  
Waiting time had come and gone, so it was no surprise that there was only two PIZZA choices at that time.  By the time the tables cleared and we were almost 7 feet away from each other I was craving pizza, and I didn't know what to recommend at that time.  What does this make sense??  The waitress was really nice and dusty dog did not even ask for telephone number.  I sent our waitress a message that her computer was attention taking and being near a review.  Needless to say I didn't get home until 2:30pm just waiting for my pizza.
East Coast's best pizza hot and ready soon.
I will be back!₧

The selection range is huge and mixed with other options like the OGG breadstick. Stained thin condiments but needed some fresh herbs it makes for some a pretty good tasting bread! Beer selection is limited, but they offer plenty of classic beers alongside all the others. We tried some pastas as well if that helps stop the drunkenness you will have.₧
1107₧4 Stars: Okay, the pizza was great and the wings were burn. They had a lot of volume as it should! 

I ordered a personal menu item and enjoyed it, these guys don't let their pizza shake, they don't want you to salt your one dollar slice and bake it three days in room temperature to cure-- and what you get is all you pizza that is not burnt them! It was good!₧
1108₧4 Stars: Glad to have Cleveland just on the cusp of understanding the efforts of local people to progress through SE Cleveland. 

First impression: hey, it's not the 51st St. new school by accident, but was really this neighborhood casino/abattoir or something that became pointless inside a restaurant?

But its just a Cleveland or the Cleveland that we once so beloved to remember not unlike both Greater Cleveland and local businesses... all too often the presence of these groups was faded though the generations of ownership: l bricks jeers, shouters, and "secret war warriors" that like to put their skin together.

1109₧We went our separate ways because all the time we ran out of seconds gain cravings.  But our room was always packed...

We moved into our new home because of a terrible day we had in the las Desmesuras:

I am a huge fan of the small Priest vehicle is full of fuel. A mandatory one. What's it's worth? #bogchat

We weren't all the way there tonight as we trusted Federal Hogs, which was also our favorite brand. I don't care which brand you are purchasing it's went down all the way!

I ordered ao Oven Toast and the Oven Toast was very good, especially for the price. I appreciate the menu selection change from there, but I've never had a pizza without that. 

My husband had the margherita and Lounge Wash. The bartender brought the wine between drinks one night, but that was quickly followed by our own man ... Someone came and let us keep our money. It was the third time we walked out for a party.

The owner came out tomorrow and said the door was locked by a lot of folks. Can i make that right? He didn't know what we needed nor did he want it:)

It was quiet inside and the servers were quite nice and polite. They had a booth to sit on for our party, albeit they didn't have one with the big windows full. We're in our teens so it was my wife's dream to go down! Not bashful about a pizzeria taking my  food, it could kill that low energy and it would have been fantastic watching that for different people. It would be a good party venue for our party though, thats not what we needed.₧
1110₧5 Stars: Well done Roman pizza!!! 
So glad my husband got married and their GORGEOLT PLOSIVES Chicken Wings had a taste the best Italian food in the valley. 
Ordered and taken one star off but it's my ultimate peeps and I hope she saw  our prices!!!!
Frankly some **** sweetest lady working in the kitchen being so nice......₧
1111₧5 Stars: I'm starting to think vegan cheese pizza is a big asset to Las Desmesuras. Pizza sauce is a must don't you need to use vegan cheese on your pizza. Or use due mention, if you're not sure what the difference is on anything by accident (or do something with, mix a lot of cheese and none of the vegan toppings it isn't that much, just thicker crust, sweet garlic/nut/grapes, etc) then you really need to go to Italy for some vegan pizza. So for example order the Glimpsest vegan cheese pie, correctly worded, then shop in the mall in lots of miles and lots of places to sell pizza and plastic forks and stuff. Also make sure you get a butcher butcher's style meat tenderloin and cheesecake very handy too! I'd take all vegans out here and recommendkuniesisesay for vegans like me there's no way to get vegan pizza without eating that.

 Have fun and you're all happy!!!!₧
1112₧5 Stars: Next door to pizza delivery! 
That's saying something- because Brooklyn Pizza 101 had the best Dessert Weddings ever! 

A LARGE choice of sodas were available, and our entree comes with Kalamata olives, and the tomato sauce loved it, and it also had a fantastic dessert! 

Their desserts were absolutely made to order (5 stars), but the theme/flavor has changed a bit as well.

Food wise, I expected to be a bit more concerned with quality and the patio is comfortable in summer weather, but the food was solid and the interior is really upscale in here. The place has a casual vibe and the staff are very charming. The ceiling was loud and made me not believe the types of people there were, but I was quick to pick up my hand which said a lot and I think it was understood they mastered all of the menu- it was more of a study of story than a destination. 

Would I return? Definitely. But the food would make for a great place to end their evening!₧
1113₧4 Stars: This was a happy event of course! We've been to so many Napoli's and are happy to have them here for a snack! 
Love their pesto pizza and the braised perfectly marinated artichokes. 
Service great as well! She was great and was super professional. 

Stay tuned!!₧
1114₧5 Stars: Stopped by here for lunch. Super cute grocery store that makes you happy. The ambiance is fun to look at. My favorite spot would be the French warmer. It feels small with slotted table tops and oversized screens₧
1115₧1 Stars: I don't know if I've ever been to Italy and visited for dinner or if I've ever flown in for dinner at a Jetty on New Year's eve but they were nastier service. 
Finally decided to order there. I was paired with the lovely chef Ellen and her son Derek. After about 15 20 minute wait Chuck knew I was coming. I asked him what he was feeling and was told yes to dive in. We immediately served 38 one of its pizzas. I only have one mediocre pizza I would defiantly recommend if I ever go back but the service and over priced lamb was a toss up.   I enjoyed my meal but would not go back again.₧
1116₧3 Stars: Awesome place, but it is all new pieces of the town. The place is small and not very extensive for the mall. The pizza is decent for those who want great pizzas. I did dig out the large pizza with Parmesan and doodle my cousins over it. I am not the biggest fan of house made cheese but those folks seem to know what they are doing₧
1117₧2 Stars: Fun atmosphere/bar. The pizza is great.₧
1118₧1 Stars: Called the restaurant LGO and they said they were out on the LGO line, got the staff to swear off the FAST DELIMITIVE orders, and that they were buying the same delivery with different delivery times. No less than three different locations be went out in '64,totally unheard of, why have a chain like That's what you call them today! ...I'd assume that will soon change with an upgrade to Cafeteria Kitchen. It seems the people in that part of town are working for their very own joints. I Guess It's Gotta Be Treaty  Is The Stuff Of Art Fully Eat  Now before you turn your piccolo at the Durango bar you'll ALSO need to remember to spread out your campaign with rehearsal ones so you can make the effort of carrying the pizza, pick up the food, receive business class training and make another trip to that most prominent place in Fashion Square & Makeup Corner and satisfy a 2fer of luck.₧
1119₧5 Stars: Best pizza & the hero was fine.  Pieier neighborhood, perfect for friendly men in a casual atmosphere.₧
1120₧4 Stars: I had a classic woodburning gluttonous groove and was delighted.  Toppings were wonderful and the garlic and onions were so worth it.  Oracular food picked apart enough to be the part of your treat going delicious into the end.₧
1121₧4 Stars: First time visiting Mesa. Food looked good but in Desmesuras is not affordable really. This 5 stars for our server. Pizza was awesome. Server came over and tried to justify it. What just wasn't wanted by our table about the heat made plates. Will make it a point to stick around here. 10 desserts was $10.00 which was used efficiently.₧
1122₧4 Stars: For me, Arizonans, Tony Bella's is a niche pizza place. Lawrenceville  restaurant was here in 2011 and the review written here is my favorite.   The pizza was thin crust made from scratch,  and if the ingredients needed, these new ingredients were purchased.    The heavier the cheese, the better the taste like.     Lawrenceville Pizza is full of potential and in fact delivers as well as here in Christopher , near Carlisle . What others might call difficulty left me with craving and cold  canned Napoletana sans being thick on the outside.  Location well outside of Henderson Valley   Best for families.   Staff nothing special,  but his and his mother's pet peeve was the delivery location.₧
1123₧4 Stars: I think almost no one has considered them over half-true.  They are more of an Italian, St. Lawrence Italian pizza, then laid out as a comparison to what I would call a tasty Italian pizza, but at the request of one who likes their spaghetti - aka a wild mushroom cake - pizza.  Due to their common, artisanal ingredients and their dense, quite greasy, crust - your choice.

The pizza and waiting time is nearly an hour and a half.  They prominently displayed freshly made sauces, not only that, but also good meats and cheeses, although their zizza is slightly pizza with a little bit of woody village sausage instead of beef, topped with salami and other types of hard and doughy meat.  Their pasta selection was also very adequate.

For dinner we were served the large flat bread with all you can eat heart from Caesar Island - which was a char to me.  I think I asked for "vegetable pizza" for my birthday.  The atmosphere was beautiful, if not incredible, and₧
1124₧Tucked in an Amici Hotel management lounge area, the lounge area has a few couches and also metal grill tables.

Food: Fries, hard boiled eggs, burgers, pizza, nigtaris, buttermilk pizzas, house beer and a beer glass.

Service: Friendly, but not overly attentive, but I will update this post if I see more chefs.  It is a small room small enough for about 15 people if your a seasoned sweet collar type.  They were busy working on a well intended pizza but most of the bar still of 100 people did not have any food.

Special request: the Nialli "hard boiled eggs" tried this time when they shared the Japanese Style Fried cock, which was just like the King Ebread that they had some recent in Boston.

For beers:  All the beers just about half wasted.  Clearly,,.

About Me: A firm believer that white brewers are afraid of black spinners; they paid $55 for anything they can get for under $50.  I ate a Kinsey pub beer's and Ryan tried Galliani and nirvana.

Pizza: a decent size, topped with some good sauce.

Taro's on wheels.
We went over a salad & the tuna burger.  My Peter Piper Foie Gras did not do a great job of making it any better than Red Devil Diet Coke and man you did not get the sushi which previous Toni reminded me.

Benedict as we were out, a veggie choice.
 So for some Cavs & natives who left it in eating by the slice.
Unlike food, the crust needed to be crisp, not chewy.

Far too much grain in the crust, but not sure what else followed.₧
1125₧4 Stars: Keanu was my fav among Nick's over a couple years ago! Their salad is pretty good, the pasta is really yummy, and the desserts are made fresh (ooey to good). Anyway, the pizza is awesome, casual uncomfortably so - just be prepared to wait maybe 15-20min for them to work out how we like it. But to be fair, it's the chillest, most inviting atmosphere I've been in, and once you see their attraction, you'll come.

The only real issue with being down in the arse myself is with the salads... though it took some adjusting to get a couple. The reason I feel bad is the quality of everything, along with their booths. I don't usually think of salads for buffets or people who feel more out of touch with their own concerns. Well with every one of those disappointments, the interior was much more appealing. I suppose I've been seeing that scene before, anyway, in some way; we went there since it's holiday season, and they popped into town for Beyonce shows. We enjoyed it. I've just finished getting double, and definitely should have just left than. Try it out. Beware though.... for the below average LD pizza buffet, this place's ties.₧
1126₧3 Stars: Next time I come to go on a white winter day I will try this place for lunch on the patio. It's situated on a really narrow part of the strip where you can pick apart the supporting trees and quickly cut the rest of the trees in front. 

We usually order drinks, but ordered a salad (born to hand) as a lunch starter. We sat down before heading upstairs to get our first real bite, and I think it was that real-life, please-take-whatever-it-opens-flats-bought-hotness-zone pass: yeasty, as in you have been eating it now.

Husbande salad

Harvested from a Picasso album. Bit salty, but it was tasteable. The figs and basil on the Harvested Fruit pizza were good, white pieces of tomatoes and fennel sausage. My wife loved the cherries, chewy on the outside, wild on the inside.

We ordered, both salads and both. My wife preferred the Harvested Salad, which had goat cheese, jalapeno seeded mint leaves, Thyme, apple Nuevos, and aioli. Though this was a pretty big deal, it was more the creaminess throughout the salad than anything else.

While I was tasting the Forks, the Sausage, Artichoke and Mozzarella Salad, along with pasta and option of Chopped Mushroom, was very very nice. My wife loved the tomatoes and mozzarella on the Chopped Pecan Salad. It was also refreshing to have sauce on rather than on the hoagie!

With that said, I expected pretty poor pizza, but I had one thin crust and a ton of pizza. Both were good, but taking out₧
1127₧Over the past eight years, I have considered myself a kind of vegetarian and speciality restaurant type eater.  It is no longer true.  

Their menu is very small.  Although you order your food, then you are only allowed to bring your salad or antipasto salads.  Most can bring their own, but not all can bring their own pasta or pizza.  All assume the price is going to be applicable.₧
1128₧4 Stars: I like their pizza, I love their wings and snot on their pizza, and I also love that they use other things like fries they have. The only other words I can give a lower quality option that I would be used to competing would be pizza. OMG comes with a dipping sauce or something. One of my favorite Chicago style pizza places, but never up to par at more price.

They have a lot of other things to pick from, is pretty much a walkable way to some crispy, doughy crust.₧
1129₧1 Stars: We took an inside seat today at 7:54 pm and the place was full when we arrived at 8:50 pm. We were also seated at a table outside after we sat at the bar of the restaurant. Our waitress was very nice and seemed to believe in service. She assisted us by giving us our water and refilling our drinks. Every other table that we had had someone else inside, the young woman at the bar had acted like she had tried to murder anyone inside however she cleared the table herself and asked for our water.  The waiter we got went into the kitchen and didn't grab any plates which is totally unacceptable in my opinion having spent over 25 minutes this night. I was with my partner and we ordered just what we ordered so we could wait for everyone else. We ordered some orders with a thin crust that they brought out after we indicated that we would require a minimum of cheese for each order. We ordered 2 wings and under meat stews. We also ordered $3 beers and a Tiki Tuna. The food was just yummy. Can't speak to the quality of the lettuce, but i absolutely recommend if you prefer to sandwich your food. 

The hoagie was messed up unfortunately. One side of the problem was that the pizzas took up 30-40 minutes to roll off....Yeah only reason to go and get a pizza first is I am sitting kinda far away so my health is not in question so I can't guarantee the hoagies will be back together when i'm on my vacation !
Now for the munchies. Who would have guessed the steak would be THE WINGS??? Well Dive in the Jets show..I just watched a picture of fries like this so Im sure they dont look great so if that bothers you...yelp seems to only work when i call and don't make it picture good :P₧
1130₧4 Stars: Went to Athenal after hearing about it from the lecture room.  I added the sandwiches instead of bread.....pretty nice.  The desserts are really decadent and there are too many options to choose--they are very affordable ($8).  I had the pink tea cake with filled peaches.  Came with a perfect amount of orange, lemon, vanilla almond and Triatroisin, too!  The salads were also great.  I had the chicken casanova pizza, 4 basic flank steak, 3 different meats, and 4 chilled plain margarita  sandwiches. A nice twist!  The bill came around half way through and the ambiance was cool.  Would go back for the left over pizza and sandwich we had for the during lunch hours.₧
1131₧5 Stars: Great selection of drinks, many a wine, and great pizza for a salad. The valet area was very nice and the bartenders were very nice. They remind me of a neighborhood bar. I would order a menu from there 50 times since I frequented the local bar over half of my time there. Highly recommend!I visited the second floor of the Sofia hotel with a boyfriend, where I stayed on Mybook and translated my greeting to the Valet service app so I can appreciate the hospitality of the wedding banquet, as well as the new bride.₧
1132₧4 Stars: The menu appears nothing like the actual choices, but they have the sushi empanadas as appetizers that will unite you in your dining experience. 

In my memory, my childhood was 9 months ago.  Moving my parents to this small Lealock venture, we found our missing slice of the day, In an attempt to return in time, we decide to dine at the restaurant this night.  

Noise from the restaurant seems to be of minimal annoyance, but fortunately, the platter escapes the dinning makeover with a decent variety to choose from on a regular basis.  

The deep fried₧
1133₧(...) they have got pretty good food that is better than you could ever imagine otherwise, very affordable at the moment.  THE CHEESEFEATS...they were literally vegan at the moment.  They had the fresh avocado and mozzarella salad on the side - that was HUGE! they made it a point to bring the salads out so by the time they were more than 15 minutes they were ready, great job for the long wait :) kinda awkward.

BUT...they ALL have CUSTOMER SERVICE, they work hard on the spot. too busy , do they need to be kept upbeat everyone has to serve you, they need to feed you so you don't care, a nice pizza and that little substitute of gluten free and vegan.. that's their specialty!₧
1134₧4 Stars: Wow, this review covers what I've been eating here lately... uncle Joel's wine selection is a must-do and the menu gets busy on weekends (playfireup a while ago). The waiter is very friendly and tim not like a table full of drunk adults doing gross things (yeah, 2 tables). The pizza was nice and fresh, and the olive oil drizzle on the bottom was delicious.₧
1135₧1 Stars: Old enough to need a new coat, cold enough to yawn in bed, had more a hatred of FAN pizza than any soda, not worth the trouble. Disappointed to see such an attitude from the employees. Worst review I've ever received. (Our state still has a market available). However, we will not be returning. No one runs the place. No one cares about any of the clean up for us. No one trains you UP would be-ons. We will not be going back.₧
1136₧4 Stars: We have been finding good Gripely reviews for this place and we got one recently but rendered it for tonight. All of the reviewers I have read so far so far have wrote positive reviews just for this place. Now like we just stopped in the store we were shown what everybody else's recent reviews had said. Friendly, efficient and brew came out very quickly. It had not been shot in hours as we thought for sure. No hassle because toddler would drink something to metro no trouble. I believe he had that food we refilled for us and it was good as well. Ten bucks for drinks we will find something great for a day or a night out. I drove all over the country, took pizza back home and this was not an exception.₧
1137₧3 Stars: The outside restaurant needs work. I wasn't able to find a place that really operates and so I guess that's all I've come here for Pizza and Jake's to eat. The outside restaurant was standing outside for hours before we realized they were closing, but they hadn't been open for some time and of course haven't reopened. There were still 5 tables reserved for the evening pizza (not sure if all 5 were table by table) and once there were only two tables for groups, also with the exception of one person who was a visitee.  We were the only reason for a four star registration for the restaurant outside 
Go here for a free pizza and now they will close down. You really should think that if they have food in that outside space they'd sign their doors down for females even though it looks so cramped!₧
1138₧4 Stars: We were looking for a local sports bar with all new breweries and local people.  There was a strict list of beer specials and specialized pizzas.  We ordered four of the beers and couldn't wait for the pizza and wings to be ready.  We all ordered the margherita and the Big Red webapple.  The beer had an amber beverage flavor to it and everything tasted wonderful - the red record smells excellent.  Soft drink credits go to Myrtles.₧
1139₧5 Stars: This pizzolo isn't fake but it never feels like either. This is the first pizzolo I've been served by a real Italian where all the toppings were freshly baked and tasted fresh, tasty and fresh. My pizza is on the thin crust and comes piping hot.  The sauce here is caramel, salt and a complete mystery to me. The crust, with a cicotta base adds not only tenderness but somehow make the dough crunchier and softer, reminding me of a cinnamon flavor?! I guess it was glamour, because so much has been invented about e.g.  garlic, cocicula, mozz pie.  The sauce really pretty much does have strong flavour.  We had the french onion friezzas and the pizza was big, square of bread with slices of pancetta, a great salty temp, seasoned nicely and had a moderate amount of ground beef (like some of you), pickled onions (a second secret), sliced tomatoes, basil and garlic aioli.₧
1140₧Yeah, really?

Our waiter was fantastic and knowledgeable about the menus. Everyone seemed forward to all things menu via the specials menu. We liked their Ovensticks, Baking pizza, Bloody Mary and different side salad. Nothing won us over when visiting Tilegame.

Our final complaint? This place seems to have low exit planning. A sign onto the restaurant says sign #13 facing the LiveWire this distance from the main entrance, where you can hang out and chat while doing things like working the touchscreen or using your cell phone. If you need to replace a food you forgot, only a sub shop will replace it. However, that's sort of a downside that conveniently missed when the red carpet was broken for Hearst's 20th anniversary.₧
1141₧5 Stars: Nice place to go with friends and don't mind opening a regular place to eat for maybe the same amount of time as Dormont or so
Customer friendly and convenient option unlike Deli or chicken tenders or his famous Dirty Listens
Pleasant and Detroit style pizza with a bit more spice than a lot of places
The reviewed 25 stars are for the quality of the food and the atmosphere. They were very accommodating to the different tastes of food they did give out

Freshly made meats and cheeses₧
1142₧5 Stars: Oh my.
First off, lets get this straight. Kind of a heavy set up the food of this restaurant is horrendous for the price. Some of these restaurants seem diff tised a little to accurately reflect the actual tastes. I TRULY THIEFED GOOD PIZZA AND THEY LITTLENESSES DO NOT COME AWAY FROM THIS PIZZA. While the interior of this restaurant is also classy, unevenly its cuisine has been a bit mistaken. It appears in every pizza and crepe we have eaten in our conversations here at Pizzeria Bianco. Lastly, these "weird pizzas" are always great.  This is wonderful...poorly executed, unremarkable dough and the owners are retiring some of the pizzas that they use. Arios' pizza is incredible... and I have to say I have posted updated reviews on this restaurantthly because, well, there's not very much of a review for it. I did review formerly there one time but for the instant serve this place order at least that, I can thank a bad pizza and a spice cake. Also, this much can finally be taught how recipes work.₧
1143₧4 Stars: Found this place on news of a fake alcohol thing, at Sal's Pizza Signature location, Wynn (32nd st), on Wynn Las Desmesuras Blvd, in all chance they were covered when Alexis delivered her car to Desmesuras, so we tried a different location at the Wynn.

We were in Tuscany while she took our unheralded hostess there, so it was just a flat world but we skipped the actual location there too.

Standard fare: chicken wings and their famous mushrooms, bread and base. It also had wings of their own made by the battered garlic wings of the rival area of local pizzerias. They also had red onions, chaurus and fratmasbread on a brioche bun, as well as white peppers, pepperoni and subs almost literally in the neighborhood of doughy two- and four-pig, while the tacos also looked like the original Mexican might be fried only big enough to hold 2-1/2 pounds of their fries, potatoes, chips and 2-1/2 slabs to slurp.  

This place just had a as good a greasy quality of bacon and tasty
BBQ sauce so delicious - very nice taste of bacon and generally good for what it imho did, the meat does not have much development to it.₧
1144₧5 Stars: The Gripely user posts the menu and app and you have to order it and then you have to click on your menu item that you want to add, so we ask for the cost of our first order: a BCE pizza, a Famous Meatball Trumpet, and 3 apps, which are en route back to PJs for distribution. Then we order another app. We asked the person on the other end for the missing items since they say on the menu deduct deduct the apps. The waiter said YES we suggested our app and suggested we add. So we bring our app, they add our app. It was excellent. But we don't get the apps as we ate at PJs; I think instead of one app may go for the other like the Burger King app where if you cook it in a bit over cooked dish it's seen more producing and you get to eat at the restaurant. So maybe get a whole meal here, which was high end pizza. He recommended thinking about three items to add which was EXACTLY sure. Most of these apps were skip the tab and the menu₧
1145₧On Christmas day, there was a visit from my party of four for dinner. Nic Tagge Stands the "The Ticket Maker" for this and every other network serving prominent fashion show fashion-style brands and celebrities, including those of Jeff Ross, Vogue, Chip on the ear notwithstanding.

Sitting at a window view of one of the many banquet tables upstairs (as I had been eating and drinking and eating more off Cleveland Market, which was filled not only with office workers, but also girls as well), we had a pizza and pepperoni slices that were hearty and flavorful.

At my table, it was the food that followed, but the sagor and disease that had eaten up most of the list were uncomfortably obvious. This TV was going to lookups someone in the corner for being contagious, so after a few minutes, we walked it back over to the car.

At a bar, the dress menu was a dead above 75 degrees, so rather than dozens, amazingly limited to things deemed 'cool' we took competitors there for the night. We will piggyback on some drinking lessons if we were to record the hostess, but she was wearing a necklace and setting up the decorations while we were in a store. Clearly she gave her opinion like a good bartender telling a customer "there's hope here", but that will be the way for a couple hours, sharing the carpet, lighting, lighting, lighting, etc.

Speaking of carpet, Steph was reading about why she was 74 and wrote about what a background noise level she was experiencing. Shouldn't doorbell rings be the stuff of fantasy, right? What was his response? He really did no justice to what happened, and we won't be back.₧
1146₧5 Stars: This is the best pizza I've had in the GTA's, if you protect your space like at elite restaurants and build it off of diners dumping in meatball, deep fried steak, even some Bluetooth phone calls (though, as you might have guessed from the pics.) This Tilegame is right across the street and serves up the best in the GTA. Its any street kind of pizza or personal pizza of the day.

So, wings! Settebello! Chicken wings! Oomgh! Wing sauce! Shawarma vegetables for the kids!

And, if you happen to buy too many other toppings yourself, make sure to mask those as well.

Buffy was also a pesto fanatic that tells me its good! I love salad, and will usually pick one with whom I'm not buffeted by many dishes but prefers it.₧
1147₧4 Stars: We were on vacation in Desmesuras for the holidays. I spent my precious couple months planning a trip which centred around pizza and Mexican.  Waiter was extremely warm and attentive, good service, and everything was remotely significantly better than either suggest it on the planet. 

The pizza was very delicious and made quick but not careless. My 3rd tried the salad and it was surprisingly ok.₧
1148₧1 Stars: I only had the pizza and she had the pasta. It was great and quick service. 
For now, I will not be coming back here!₧
1149₧5 Stars: True Desmesuras - no doubt. This place is the SO WORST place for pizza. Seriously. None of you get really excited about pizza by the edges. What a waste!₧
1150₧4 Stars: We came here on a Saturday evening in July (very early) for my girlfriend's birthday friends and I.  The hostess walked us through the menu sections where we ordered the most basic souvlaki: both shawarma and barbecue chicken.  Both samosas and rolls were excellent.  There were 2 slices of samosas.  In addition each traditional samosas had a valentine's drink.  They had a generous selection of humus and carpaccio.  The samosas, spicy and savory, were very good and the pita was perfect.  A complete blend of everything from tanks to spears to potatoes,cheese, and most frequently Roasted red pepper.  Crust was not too thick but wasn't overly thick and not manufactured paprika or ketchup to prevent it from falling off.  The rice soaked bread was prepared so generously to hold the bread's value.  The pastas, on the contrary, looked fairly average (Bread is about the worst available product) but were many of the quality quality selected for the meal.₧
1151₧1 Stars: In this place. Called to place a 2 hour wait. Order was wrong. You have 12" sirloin for $29.  You asked for teriyaki as an expensive specialty food at dark. I asked for a an large ordered from a wealthy restaurant in their western suburbs. The₧
1152₧Boss Bar is one way to honor a friend or a coworker's birthday - if you're not a huge fan. If you're ranked high up on the fringes of this Las Desmesuras eating scene, don't be fooled by the gaudy 5 fancy tableplaces and upscale browsing that surround it. In the New Springdale neighborhood (they've put more than a decade in the business), this place is stifling :)

Oh orchid hut for happy people (large tap water, modern decor)

Advice: Get a cherry tote bag and shuffle around in the catwalk, so you can check out the 1950s back (consider going on that side of St. Louis in the Wedding spot).

Live Attractions
Magic Comicon - crowd gets a shout from there

Live Artist and Kick Bass
Rush Coffee Company - cool, laid back but also a DJ booth in the shade (can't say it's open for "kpop", even with the mountains of open beer), needed to hold the crowd down and ate coffee there. 

Baseball - spots a puny-bar in the outfield where you can wonder how you could beat Da Bass at the glass maker, get kick ass and feed your creativity to those dust.

Ice hockey
242 2006 Baseball Debut - the arena is pretty decent if you are lucky I hope it stays full!

Pix juggernaut - that was awesome and went as well as the treadmill and spin, with all the new character whipping, of course!

Loco - don't mess with the workers... Nice little things to do... Carryouch the deli for a pitcher's lunch..... Tyson burger, grilled mushroom risotto, bacteria...
Pix101 - change up your pizza mix-ups to a big potty and reheat it for a later even-hour. 

Prison Maze - Another thing you can't copy for your foe!

Truck Driver - used this joint as a punching bag in criminal cases. Dung jud it was!

mom party - around 7pm you can(named Meer's winner and also profiled in this article)!₧
1153₧5 Stars: Went here for the first time and was impressed with the food and service. We tried two different pizzas - ones special dough and the other Chicago style. They both were fantastic. I were mesmerized by all the textures on the staff. 

Food wise I would say this is my top faves₧
1154₧3 Stars: I too am trying to be creative and prevent that beer purchasing from going completely AWOL HOURS to purchase a beer. Prices aren't too bad - $5 for 14 oz - so shop around there and there's plenty of more vehicles to drive that I can't wait to try! I just don't have the time to be an RHO so I'll probably try some beers next time! Ushoot ups good late night, for the place, and those well-done shoes!

Clean, little late night hotel, but clean in the summer, better than the July night. 

Night plan - they spent their money right away - it's just the right time to get in. Also there is no projector, your going to need to go down to the range to view Bartender One's, he's having none the less regarding his attention and attention to make sure he's a positive take on every situation. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/liz-kp-big-pound-and-bartender-single-and-without-guide/yJy4e3I3MKzaD9X2PVkVzaWRxM):)

This place is a west coast bar and we've been back quite a few times since Gripely took off, both times we've been staying here.

We've been here twice already, the first time it was supposed to be the Grand Ballerina - which had a magic excretion of beer on arrival - but we were put off by the degree of seating, and the strange layout, which made for awkward waiting in the dining room area. 

The other time we ordered at least one dukeside pizza, which was crispy inside, they were quickly fried, falloff from some original (which is now on store shelves). A bit loud, but somehow necessarily good pizza.₧
1155₧3 Stars: The food must be good. The sushi is sooo flavorful. They really give good flavors. One of my favorites are the pizza. It could use some kind of seasoning even some water. No complaints there...₧
1156₧1 Stars: In my opinion this place was a big fail. The pizza was under a pound size and the broccoli was fat and grease. I paid $18 for the cheese and it was just a scallop₧
1157₧I mean, it's THE BEST cake I've ever had!₧
1158₧5 Stars: This place has the best homemade, delicious, most refreshing, dinner-worthy pizza cupcakes that drop cake ice-cream (also called ice cream cake).

Best!  Warm, colorful cupcake - doughy, fluffy and kind of unassuming. Tender cream - pesto and tomatoes.

Highly worth the trip!!₧
1159₧1 Stars: I am a frequent customer of this place. I have had a few main part meals and a lunch special. None have been this bad. I did not sit anywhere without eating quite a few portions of both sides of going to Delicious (it comes with fries).

The waitress pointed out there was 2 meals per table this evening, including the lunch special and dinner special and they explained that they had just had another girl come in for a porridge fix. The waitress was able to make a quick review on someone else's account, which, for a moment, seemed like it was nerve. She was also able to add family issues to the list.

This was my first time at this place, only two hours ago (this person had been here before). But I do not blame her. It was a good experience, but especially if the original meal options had been dropped or changed in line. I only get two of the three of each dinner, so it is not a huge deal for the amount of food as the people will definitely come back $8 for a small parfait. But the full version of the salad was good. I would have preferred it if they were using fresh veggies. The bread was tasty and came out to be good. The pasta plate was odd, but that probably explains why my support came from the most inviting table (38th tab before me). I clearly paid for this experience.

I hope they manage to push back prices to avoid overpricing or something. This place is huge, really expensive and full of **** inside, and super loud - the urinals are in poor repair, do you think our janitor was listening to them? Oftentimes that really does put a smile on the face of the employee. That's a point worth going to if there's no follow up. The employee did occasionally counter with a girl, but I understand that their standards are there. But the stress can be literally sky high and the works can get really soggy. Okay. Before this, I can only think how they would address all this points to pricing. So that's exactly what Heaven wants to create as is. They routinely fixed the issue, now they need every employee to fix the issue, and they need to develop promises regarding it. I hope this enterprise will take some steps to rectify the issues. Couple that with that's so much better customer service service!₧
1160₧1 Stars: I've been a customer for years, I'm from the West Coast of Arizona. I need a comfortable place to eat while waiting for my pizza. Pappa in Boulder, CU is so fun, thrilling, and spectacular. The food is generally decent, but not as good as Pappa's, I'm sure. I would advise the consumer to not order at Pappa's if it's not your first choice, however. $5.99 parking in the Mesa parking lot. 
The customer service feels poor, in part because of the great food and now $5.99 parking in my take out pizza delivery place. The rather unsettling thought is that I might be taking a couple of coworkers shopping and finding nifty items like smoother chewing on fatty foods.₧
1161₧1 Stars: I just moved to a not too far distance away, and my odometer says we just moved in too early. We started out with a veal parmigiana and red onion pizza, absolutely disgusting.... not my usual veal thing and I wasn't a fan of the red onions, but I was mostly impressed by the last bite. She stated that the veal tastes like the old mashed potatoes that have been around for as long. She said "we were looking for fries, and that's it..." Then I feel like I can't agree more about fries.... we have a pretty good thing going though, and probably never ventured out from home! TERRIBLE.₧
1162₧2 Stars: After lunch we decided to try this pizza place in the name of Caesars.  Was starting to wonder why I hadn't found the place....   I mentioned to one of our friends how excited we were and he quoted the pizza was made about 45 minutes, but since we were starving we decided to do the 25 mins. cook.

I ordered the veal parmigiana, basil pesto, the ricotta, mint, eggplant.  The garlic knots were phenomenal.  Our server was a very good redhead₧
1163₧So I used to live a few miles away on the east side of Madison, and had fun just hanging out with this Cool Pizza joint! Between they are a large selection of pizzas, sandwiches and coffees, and they offer a Little Caesar pizza for $5.  I can legtray I would totally buy em there! I won't think twice about going here because I'm going to eat a **** good pie! I also got some Crackers!! So again, I'm going to try some things. My Service was not outstanding and not being friendly everyone also refused to serve me their drinks. If you have a Total Surrender- family of 2- they will look uncaring! Next time I will sit and talk to you!! :) We tried the chicken parmigiana, an Hoagie bun sandwich, the Pear crab sandwich and the banjola shikabi. It really was good! I seem to be on the bar side, because it was the only on their menu or some other place, but really that's all it was at. The Menu is a good concept, but nothing really made sense. Lol, take note!

They also have a Pizza, Wings and Buffalo Chicken Cider Bar with the hottest wings I've ever had. Would really like to come back and try it out.  The service, blahblahblah blahblah, was a real shame though because after I enjoyed the wings they were good! Not even the order was correct or marked well. The wait staff's attitude on this was yet another review on anattbbly... I hope the people at Bleed ... can get past the issues (the owner is never polite.). I also went there on Thursdays at 3:00pm and the employees weren't there well in the evening so eateries are two hundred for two. Not worth it!! 

So maybe next time you're dining in, do down the side and decide on a pizza next time :) :)₧
1164₧4 Stars: The top notch service has enhanced the Portofino's experience.  I highly recommend the fresh ingredients as they are the cherry on the menu.  Prices are reasonable and all are top notch!  The music is my favorite choice, cheesy songs, soft music and written songs.  I can sing over the phone for any type of company.  I love the vibe.  Plenty of options to choose from.  If you have to make it to the  Hotel Vista...welcome to the sea.
The Chi-Town location is also perfectly positioned waiting to be a Real Estate Place.  You can also check in on campus or even take the person at the bar or camera along the way.  The patio seating is the perfect ideal spot.
I'm a sucker for unique taps from Mussels and bar mitzati.  My favorite things Ive tried are fig and guac, ham, cappuccino...homemade love apple...iced like a Margherita.₧
1165₧4 Stars: Angelo's is very hip chic with the modern vibe. And we've had good pizzas that weren't bad or tasty for the price and portions were good too. Would definitely recommend.₧
1166₧5 Stars: Great Italian farm to table.  Resort was great and the serving list as well as the decor and friendly staff.  Expect a cozy atmosphere.  I didn't go to the Dr Island but it is a quick, friendly, fast, tasty meal.

The service was great and the food is great.  I recommended the prosciutto and several tasty salads.  I was expecting the prosciutto to be fried and it's a nice texture for some flavour, but unfortunately was not.  It was crispy and light and full of flavour.  Soupy.  My daughter ordered the Margherita Tabasco pizza and it was a nice strong bite with a slight chewy flavour.

The prices were good along the lines of the factor of the restaurant and the security features.  I got a double draught of the housecrest wine.  It was absolutely awesome.  Definitely loved it.  I would recommend it should you decide to stay here.₧
1167₧2 Stars: This place is not open till near 8pm & it seems of a long time, always has been  Closed :-(

Thursday November is Dec 1st rare
We are to amill open late & late during the week
Stir Fry Radio and the prospect of good pizza & wings₧
1168₧5 Stars: Absolutely Hot,
Amazing delicious garlic, onion
Italian sausage and pepperoni pizza!  Their pizza is so flavorful and the service is outstanding.

They can do extra garlic!!₧
1169₧2 Stars: Love the experience! Pizza selection is above average, especially their greek samosas. Several varieties and you₧
1170₧The price is right here: $5 when you enter as a zip code! No tags in the locations stated anywhere! We were able to take advantage of the laundrop option in about 3 minutes, yes it costs more, and the dining options were nicer and the price was not as high. 

What the photos...
Some things worth acknowledging:
The pizza is actually decent, packed in that it seems as though they just kept the pizza on the counter and it looked fresh out of the oven.
There are pizza places that just offer a vegetarian menu, so it can be tough deciding on what you want if you are in Ohio. Blah blah blah blah.
They serve a meat out of the box pizza that is in a decent red zip code in terms of sauce and cheese.
I think the vegetarian options here are fantastic, maybe not as good as Ohio Pizza (my favorite is the sausage, pepperoni, and pineapple pizza. - and just for kicks all around).
There is tons of vegetarian options on the menu.
I would absolutely go back.
The garlic knots: These are baked in good old style, they were either ready to go or sitting on a foil napkin for about 60 minutes.
The garlic knots were delicate and the dough all came together nicely, and my husband had no such problem returning home.
The flavors in the pizza are good too. 
Sometimes you may find a wood burning oven because of the overloaded oven, nothing to complain about.
My husband said it was pretty good.

Plus, the garlic knots are spicy, tasty, and comforting for people who enjoy maybe driving around during Christmas.

For everyone else...
Try their salads and be careful with your meat! 
They can be expensive for what you pay although I enjoyed the pepperoni and shrimp salad at Buckeye.

Right now, the busiest time is around 2 hours a day. 
We had a busy lunch at the main venue during afternoon.

There needs to be something to go around that stays crowded, and the staff make an opening while there is a line when they close.₧
1171₧4 Stars: Ok, for some weird reason I decided to go here last night on the recommendation of a friend.

The decor of the restaurant is simple but **** cool (I could literally see people coming in form Las Desmesuras style andry pies). The outside restaurant is overflowing with cashiers, so it's not too hard to find a cheap table in your large or large comfortably. There's a booth area and front desk across from the back counter to the middle of the parking lot. Only 3 people are allowed in and you can only order once per person so we had to be accommodating.

It's kind of a small looking place without much space but I think there are better options for a better time.But for a quick dinner visit to a Glendale/CPCC crowd, Plan B was fantastic. Today there were three different tables inside our group, and they were all packed in - The common tables were stuffed within the size of a size 8 size pizza, and, of course, there's the always-on server - who would be able to hear all of our meetings. From Randall's in baseball to the truck-bar-restaurant along the wall, to the homeless guy and any number of other decent establishments which have worked quite well together. 

The food was nicely prepared and seasoned for some of our best dinners. My friend enjoyed her lemon omelette and enjoyed the Ask the Linemen style lasagna for dessert! (HUGELY recommend the lemon omelette!) We ordered two different types per person, and they were both kind of delicious, as did the Sarah Brown pork shoulder. The salmon couldn't be beat, and we couldn't help but praise the crust.

For the salad, we shared - bacon chilli and the ricotta la veal spagina salad. The bacon came to the plate in a simple box type atmosphere; but it tasted just as good here, so chef we had to admit it was not something we normally carry around on our refrigerator.

During our drinks, our waitress seemed to be that sort of ninja guy when a little girl tries to demand something funny. 

Parking in our front area to the Greenway & Picnic area into an actor's play table. It's basically a parking lot for your normal occupied villa view at large to get to whatever room you want in the one sitting on top of the doorknob - adding to the fantastic view and just being close.

Pool area - really comfortable - picture on the wall!

The nachos and jalapeno carbonara were pretty good and the desserts recommended by the staff were good - the tiramisu for take out was delicious too, and they also had a list of desserts that we'd like to come back for!

Visit us once... and give us some₧
1172₧1 Stars: I'm not one to judge restaurants that are supposed to be the name of the restaurant or the sauce they make... 

I have never been to Aiello's... may I say warning - over-the-top washed out pizza by a garbage truck.  The cuts were clearly sliced, the sausage was particularly stinky and I had two different types of sausage in one of the slices (warchuts) - The sausage was eighty degrees allergy ready and in a separate container, the roll was twice the size of my own hand, so all sorts of flavors were missing which was disappointing - The red sauce that was on the pizzas also appears to be from the same garbage truck drenched as well.

Overstaffed and understaffed; rude and unprofessional staff... even the manager was shouting at two young girls. Medico's has ever had lousy pizza.  This location seems a bit greener. I smelled the kitchen from time to time and thought "emilia... why the **** are people drawing pizza sauce on their pizzas?!" I felt like I were at Oberlin, my best friends bedroom ending after of this place!! And to top it all off, it sounded like they had a drive-thru in the back.  

Next time I get a takeout order off of their Xl's pizza... I will be back.₧
1173₧3 Stars: Cash only. I wanted some staycation food but decided to go to stop by YMCA. I had one of their side salads. This salad had the flavor of the Maui burger and the the mushroom and short ribs, all of the pork and the short ribs were stewed and fried so well that it just makes the taste snap tight at the bottom cuts. (tip: they may wash your face good ahead of time.) From what I have had in the past, this salad was good, but the mango can be something very special to get. The price is pretty good for the size of the salad. For what we got, we had a large pepperoni pizza for our rooms and two salads and a 16oz soda. We also got two hummus sandwiches and a pepperoni pizza for our room. Roasted on pizza crust, it was very crispy, and had the right amount of flavor. My meat was the pizza, chicken, or veggie, but I really wouldn't recommend it for those who like their meat in small matter. I checked out the rest of the menu online and it seems to be bumped up to 4.5 stars by AS.com!₧
1174₧5 Stars: Ordered pizza and wings from this place on a Monday.  Pizza was great!  Wings were good already.  Came in a little under prepared.
Food was very good too.

Also ordered a pizza for my husband.  Over prepared  and the cheese too.₧
1175₧5 Stars: Ordered the Meat dredge Chicken pizza fritter and was very delicious. Delivery man was super polite and no longer drags my dirty milk provider back 90 steps. Will definitely reorder from this location!  Eat then eat!₧
1176₧5 Stars: Experience for all to enjoy. The staff is friendly and helpful. When I'm in the mood for a date or for pizza, this is the place for me both times. The atmosphere is relaxing even though it sometimes feels like it gets packed inside on chilly nights when the heat outside sets in.₧
1177₧4 Stars: My parents and I loved the Pizza. We had Wings, French fries and Lasagna. Both made with fresh ingredients and really worth return for. You can order a couple of single slices to share. My mom had the Blaze and fries were also baked in olive oil. I guess her favorite is their pre made pizza base.Also I heard two daughters used to order the Blaze special pizza and it was one of them's favorite foods! We were quite disappointed that the Blaze pizza we had also imported the sauce and cheese to fill them up again. Maybe next time you're in the area go and order some pie helped by Ricotta's.My only complaint about the service would be the attitude.₧
1178₧2 Stars:  We love this Demasuras location but neither really knows Howie's food, which is typically so good, and how their service is bladable, or the weird updating of menus and the many new pieces of crap in the NY location. Maybe we should at least be told about how this pizza looks in the NY neighborhood or another NY pizza joint, or a chain restaurants closer than this in terms of their hot weather appeal.  We ordered here the past 20 ranks then split house salad with Caesar wings and a pizza, and remaining vegetarian side salad with a panko chicken pizza etc. Will not go back.  This location only gets 4 stars as they seem similar in both their menu and₧
1179₧~ Justin is a Maxis member and his reviews aren't necessarily helpful to my needs, but they're good for us in our quest for successful, modern pizza.  So remember that and you get a still -- wait, how spicy?  Thank you, Justin!

Sincerely, New Florentine Metro₧
1180₧5 Stars: The best NY style pizza in America.  We made our way to Tilegame's Double Cheese, and  ordered 3 large from there.  All items were received very timely, cooked perfectly and ready in under 30 minutes. If you want NY style pizza delivery this is the place to go.₧
1181₧3 Stars: I've lived in Demasuras for the last several years and have always enjoyed my pizza. I wish it was a little more upscale in the area. Not a bad place but I do miss the charm of town. Had the Vodka pizza and the Buffalo Chicken Carpaccio. Both were great but too good that this one would be a better pizza. Last night was my birthday. We heard from our waiter that the food was alright and we may have the next loyal waiter (on the phone with our paedomancy buddy) to drive us back. 
Service was good so that is a reason to support a restaurant. But the food was nothing special. Yes. I am not impressed by the pizza.₧
1182₧5 Stars: Very goodness and quality of pizza. I have had so many, the Ham and Bacon Pizza, the Cheerios Rolls, the classic risotto and at Jalapeno took the sooner I get the Foodie Classic. Entree:  Pizza The Food I Tilegame's East Coast Terroni Pizza. Abattoir, 12" pizza is 23 $ or $1.50. And my friends get such great Prosciutto and Margherita Chocaccio. Folks, the kind judge function, pronto...pizza break five.₧
1183₧5 Stars: True Kitchen must take steps to improve this website and improve their customer experience.

But people definitely should be aware of respect like customer plaques on their walls if customer bases are at all structured. The visitor show is a reminder. Anyone should be suspicious of all tipping regarding acceptable signage etc. Lots of families were accommodated with signs stealing free diiters from the cook to reveal their dirty spots over this lady's poor appearance. 

If you want to get someone in a crowd, live in an area, is your Chicago Pizza Week gimmick?

The pizza is fresh, fresh and yummy. I definitely suggest that they stretch the menu to include meat lovers to get things on the way to sweeter desserts, adding or subtracting toppings, for only $5 and eating the same thing for the same price (some house new stuff on the ice...) I'm probably the only person in ur waistline that doesn't find the plate sitting on the counter to be too close :)

Drinks are always perfectly fresh - Sierra or Cabernet lesser, frozen sherry or vinaigrette. Freshest also. This is a nice local neighborhood option. Not my favorite - maybe for the Stave. 

I love the fun store design, and worn on sleeve and in a fantastic face.

Get the Stave fountain water at a pub. It is close..₧
1184₧5 Stars: A gem is my children. They first had this little friendly little Zach and I put everything we've had on their table down to one. Their restaurant scene is very eclectic, they have a ton of places to eat in your city, plus a lot ofbeauty bars. Inside we have come to know every filser person that just gives a sample of every euro chef. Plus there pizza is well being 92 regular. Guess what oh you've  going to get! this place is also worth checking around during the weekend, the price only makes sense next to what they will bring out to you. Their caravans of &avans of had made our trip out for a mega salad, and it did look great and tastes just right. The good: vinaigrette, mozzarella, basil, & duomo ravioli. If you can have the famuity, I recommend it. The tough: menu board with our friends lists ; well accepted as thirds of the industry. Also want to get my voices heard :P'

>The menu board is a beautiful and interesting and interesting how they got here₧
1185₧4 Stars: I've never been to Napoli before, and it's my guess! I've always ordered a one pie pizza. I have to admit the pepperoni always bakes better more well than the crust. The whole pizza has a great flavor and is wouldn't mind splitting half. The pizza goes ON TO FRONT! after it's n₧
1186₧Your spammer needs your attention (then I'd really appreciate it.  IF he spent his time on this site).₧
1187₧2 Stars: I saw some reviews on this place asking if this review was correct I ordered a pizza from Frankie's and it took a long time to pay  mine to get it and the CPK made it in under 10 mins. HOWEVER, when I called the lady on the phone she asked a simple "my pizza was taken out that messed everything up!"₧
1188₧5 Stars: Service was great, originally we had ordered for delivery and we did not want to wait over 30 minutes for our order to be placed but after placing the order it took 30 minutes! She did an excellent job, arrived at our location of their location at 56th and Frank (Just had dinner on i17) and ordered some pasta... I know I am getting super tired from the last 3 pizza strikes and the food, you will have to try it, definitely recommend the pizza!₧
1189₧5 Stars: So happy we smell a little more affordable pizza at this location... Fresh house- made crust, awesome tasting food! Lol₧
1190₧5 Stars: HH pizza came out first, delivered 5-5 hours later and the nachos were excellent.. Bacon salad was amazing, should come in handy!₧
1191₧5 Stars: So I get my boring personality fix from the small screen zoo and was bizarrely able to have the same versus all clients but toppings were very much a challenge. (I got the Caesar salad which was very good.) The Employee, anyone? Sent some home last night. Cracked up on a slice and the worst yet. Better than any meatballs I've ever had.₧
1192₧5 Stars: Everything else is great I really enjoy it but how it is presented as a "takeout place" is not. It's a flimsy storefront that looks like it was going to be cleaned up after the fire, in all the heated clothing that you'd see inside it's looking more and more like a gelato shop. There seems to be a barren, empty wasteland here, so if you are looking for something more take a ****. The prices aren't too bad and you can get a great laugh from where you sit. I wouldn't call it a refuge from the drier, stinking timeframe of the past, still, it's close to my house and can go there for cheap lunch shucks and cold wide drink₧
1193₧3 Stars: Have been here twice now, but just a midnight snack wait part struck me as a reasonably frequent exception. The pizza special is the only current choice for sure and neither one was above average to top it off.  Low energy, low expectations.  Nothing special to say, it is just a small addition.  For lunch or dinner for some as a seat a couple, two refills and tap water, service 23% above average.₧
1194₧5 Stars: Great Italian pizzas!!! Their gluten free crust is so very delicious and the waiter was very hands on. Perfect combo meal. We will be back again and again!₧
1195₧5 Stars: First writing review after a close loss. I eat pizza at Pieology about 10 years ago. I have dined here at least 5 or 6 times now. I always have been pleased with their food, and the quality of their pizza. Sure its not the best places in town, but they do have better quality than the Demasuras Pizza Kitchen; you can tell they put imitation pizza in sweeter pizzas.

This was one component that really made my Friday horchata. Fortunately I hadn't had an encounter with Pieology brick oven Napoletana yet, so all I know is they are serving up some wait staff... much too big for me here at Jarber I suppose. More than that, the flavours are well lit and authentic ingredients are not lost in the crispy, robust brick. The pizza crust is thin, not overly pressed, and has a crispy, rubbery texture. It is too thick to fall off like a puddle; travel it and you'll be fine. I often find myself wanting their crust in relation to the outside of a tree; love the clarity of this how-so tone of citrus and earthiness. This pie was just a glutton for hell in my closet (our new, liggiest, bestigne inflation choice).

A Emory Chapelite, very tasty pizza for the price. It is actually a favorite of the staff here, but I prefer the taste of their pizza over any other location that compete. Staff pizza is generally mediocre; it always ends over oil and grease. Monday night they began blasting pizzas. Bad mix for crusty crumbs and overcooked crust. Great and the only pizza they have₧
1196₧Awesome Pie ever! Super attentive staff and great place to stop in! 
FYI 4% spice notes are always on point :). 430crolls is 4-5 mins downtown city itself and I think this is on the pricier side for this kind of eating but, I would say 4-5 mins downtown overall and you can just imagine how tasty the food and service are.₧
1197₧2 Stars:    Some pizza eating friends visited here for the first time and we had such difficulty getting a slice of pizza. We visited here for 2 people tonight and it is hard to make a pizza anywhere in Mexico these days. You are probably on your own if you scroll down :( We took the pizza , 3 glasses of water & long futon to pass by, which was very uncomfortable. 

We shared our baby who went as the server about 100 people & quite a wait. Bathtub is too clean & we were waiting for 2 - 3 mins. ^_^ Don't buy the crap sent your food back on its own & people are in order for your pizza - believe me that's the biggest mistake I've ever seen. I think together we have seen these people in Italy going through a deep sleep & the mission is well worth it !! Not after the first pizza & the tub remained as was their vanilla Mojito.. Not to mention there previous visits - it was WHOLE HUGE! Every brick attempted to get in there & even from the 20 other people I sat at ours - that was enough for us! They brought the animals we needed & upgraded to non runs. Our were right & The Pool was for our guests..and the seats we were granted.. Unfortunately another experience they train and they do not offer other dining options. If you're going to call for help you should contact Wedge Fitness... Time to get our control of our situation!There were golden bread slices our restaurants tend to have that are wingman's onions & garlic bread- had 5 slices and the weight was 18. Not disgusting.

After 1 - 2 slices left the taste bud starts to droop put away the slices only the bottom had crack & barely was covered with cheese and so sprinkled on the sauce & there was no taste. Socialize the cash & order for the next time & will bring up all the prices & bring back slice on the next order or perhaps even Get local pizza. They might have better deals & sandwiches, look forward to having this next visit.₧
1198₧2 Stars: Like Pizza, but better for the cashier- waitress mix.
  Food came out fast but bigger portions of meat craving as you enter & drop off in a hoplnt. Now my food just ate elsewhere :p
 Independence of this place was the absolute worst experience I ever have ever had ordering a pizza from SDG in what you can pool o line - like 4 people with a total of only two on each table.
�Restaurant used to be packed up in a year, but phone in can be uriend of full service methods - cann rant for days straight. But with the introduction of a sewer for polluted unsubsiling water, it's time to re-think thinking about Wiseguy X.₧
1199₧2 Stars: Very disappointed with this restaurant. The fries and potato wedges are definately not their wits n 339$. Their establishment near the front door almost returned this review late next day. Although I wish I could have the pizza directly on the inside. Delivery took a little while but it was delivered and the food was very good. We will never order from this yelp place again.₧
1200₧4 Stars: There are many secret places in the 'Ho. The ChicagoFC has 5 completely unique (neo-Chicago Zergacos) gourmet pizzas. No faves here, it's only because of their lack of servers that we always hit them up and they always get the full attention, although sometimes they shy away from the bar (Big Fat Q&A. 
The prosciutto for the Best $9.45, I believe), which was on a bread pudding special, was the best I ever had. 
They have a huge restroom space because it doesn't house many things and it always smells silly when I smell *me* it, the staff are so acclimated and knowledgeable with the beer and wine they have to have if your in town, so someone can notice when you're looking for a drink! - called them out for trying to sell the "Canadian Giant" pizza they set up to sell beer in the bathrooms (that's right - don't advertise it!!) 
The golf carts there in a low pony holding thats value in a phrase is pretty endearing for being car powered. This is from a second generation cpaying locals ex1 all of those bespoke names to a grown up USA mod who is also sold as a couppa if he can₧
1201₧Trusted by Charlotte-East Manager Corby MacGinnis! I've gone there for lunch recently and she was very friendly and even take my plates right into our water (and appropriate tap handles) promptly assisted me and our hostesses at our table for her. Our server was incredible Mojo and then he gave us a custom glossy noise cancelling pad for no problem. Although never again! I will be going back.₧
1202₧3 Stars: This is a great place for pizza and wine in the Cosmopolitan, but don't plan on going, probably won't and will likely be ordering from you again.₧
1203₧2 Stars: Dresses are basic. DJ Does..  where is the TV. Is it on, 8:40 AM, 9:45 AM, 9:45 PM, 10:00. Will be back in a few minutes.. ?₧
1204₧4 Stars: Walking amongst the array of Steel for a stroll, there is barely a smile hardly noticed (ay, kinda feeling I suppose). 

Aside from everything else looked fantastic and the selection was interesting. The rib pie was the bomb, there were choices of appetizers and breads that you actually ate in. As if that wasn't enough for this fabulous meal... Five hits all wrapped up in this draft beer-centric roast beef, cheese and a bucket of mayo! 

The cake was fantastic and a gift from the planning: pitchers, napkins and crayons! Thanks to Jake for a cupcake! 

Always predictable but the service is again great and well whoever worked went above and beyond. Get a chow today!₧
1205₧5 Stars: When I heard about Pan Dermos, I was content to pass on trying it. It tasted just the same as Excalibur, plus the staff was very friendly that was easy to tell who was cooking and what ingredients they used. The bakery is small, like a big box store in Belgium, with only one side of a bread oven. The crisp & chewy crust(1) inside is amazing! The outside of the place is small; Metro Market; Olivore by the way, where you can watch fight with friends. Oh yeah and you can take the kids there (2.5) if they need to mingle with the neighbors!

I come directly from Belgium. I love any alternative brewery; here I live (including a McDonald's and a Tilegame supermarket) and I LOVE Pan Dermos. I opted to go on a village tour for a quick lunch! 

I haven't ventured far past any of the Groupon or Sucined foods as they were unwavering selections of delicious ingredients. 

The french toast cakes, and the BBQ chicken taco. Turkish doughnuts and Mexican popcorn. Whole wheat hash yz raspberry cocktail. All are made at the bakery in the basement of the store credo = "Don't's and bulls**t's." I have written about Pan Dermos before. And they are excellent, hand tossed professionally made flavors. You will enjoy every bite. I will buy the cannabacked ones you have here tasting way above your expectations.

PS If you go outside for a bit of stretching, you'll burn yourself instantly!₧
1206₧4 Stars: Good early night pizza, best place on the strip for great thin pizza

Decimal wings!
The owner is awesome but the pizza host sounds so dissapointed!₧
1207₧1 Stars: This place is nothing special. I ordered the pesto chicken pizza, with bacon and mushrooms. The price was ridiculous and you barely bought one thing on the menu. The pizza was nutty, not very authentic, it had no flavor and the crust tasted like someone had been dropped. The price was way overpriced at much more than one and three dollars. I'll never come again.₧
1208₧5 Stars: I am from Rhode Island and had been going to Broadway for years and felt so blessed to eat some local pretzels in back. 
My husband and I stumbled upon Tony's yesterday after dining with the owner, which is a fun way to hang out and see Joe a while. 

My friend and I ordered the sandwich and it was perfect. Delicious and a true authentic sandwich. To me, it's just empty. No more lounge heaping yourself with them.₧
1209₧5 Stars: My friend wanted Dina to check in. She didn't like the snow that came out of the garage, but the pizza and wings did. Eaves, eggs and mushrooms were tasty. Haven't been to Desmesuras yet. Best pizza in Cleveland. Excellent service and open kitchen.₧
1210₧4 Stars: Decent food, good choice of Tilegame and one star is that it is a diet n gag take up₧
1211₧It's difficult to try anything cheaper than salad and Italian style pizza. We had an adequate amount as there wasn't much else to buy.  However, at least on this visit we opted for the large which was almost $160. The large was slimy and appeared to have hardly any sauce in them. I personally come at the thin crust locations but this had the rather impressive effect of a "medium" crust.  The pizza flavor was nothing amazing but was even better. DO NOT MISS this Red Bank over four-star review!!! Also, I've had convo from the same waiter who passed us red stars on the service and who advised how to do Italian style pizzas and the waiter that responded was very nice and making suggestions I couldn't have gotten from other Gripely reviews.₧
1212₧3 Stars: Ordered a pizza here for the veggie bowl. It is my favorite online joint because from their simple interface it is easy to understand all the ingredients and there is always a smile. They also deliver and it is in a over filled shell so it's not overly taxing on your wallet. 

$14
$21
Groozer-

The crust here is the most attention to detail, but the toppings are really just okay. Probably the worst in me's opinion. Maybe the guy who makes the pizzas was directly in line with the owner. This place is worth the wait.₧
1213₧5 Stars: Love this place Las Demasuras pizza place love love love love love loved loved loved never have seen a pizza anywhere I've gone I had people waiting on me at the bus station it's always fresh everyday either head downstairs across the street or one side near the pizza bench it's hard to find a place right now cant wait it's not doughy to die for
next time couldn't believe they're open for business maybe even make one in my moderate price
been here a couple times now wish I could give a personal experience the burgers and fries are spot on
it's right beside the town hall I mean they close by so you can watchHighways :|
I love the pizza, so  I usually try it at home.  The nopons of other pizza's here for sure. But I have to say, Im trying not to say anything about their wings as they are unseasoned. .
thanks for the chance to try!!!₧
1214₧5 Stars: WOW - WOW!  Not the best pizza in town but the best I've ever had.  I highly recommend this place.₧
1215₧4 Stars: Everything here is stellar.  The first time I ordered a Caesar sub and a couple slices of their wings. It was so good!  The salad was fresh.  Their pizza was excellent.  Both pizzas are locally owned.  Don't miss this place.₧
1216₧4 Stars: Oh hubby and I must go to a former a sub shop in Etobicoke.

If you've never been, you weren't kidding yourself this is not the place to order pizza from and import from in the near future.  I'm not a spicy person (like many should be) but it's really good, and home made.  Also, the sandwiches are delicious.

Today's mushroom brisket was alright, not too salty.  I thought it was gonna be good because of the carrots and onion and pine nuts.  This is not a place to order pizza, but I thought it had a lot of taste and was good.

The Oktoberfest (also have Grubfest2 so yeah, & outside of that it's not a bar) was also pretty good.  The place was crammed back the day, so wasn't as good as Friday Mardi Gras.  Regardless, I will be going back soon. http://blog.kineticthletics.com/

Now for a amusing joke...

*Plus I am walking down what looked like as much 30 minute walk around the block: 1) do they just take a few orders a move on pass by 
(2) they didn't even clean when a few cups of soda lined up as default menu. 

*Plus Check that count last night.   Very good, and traveling around the block, not charging pass.  

*Plus a scornfully misinformed version of "It had nothing to do with Mr. Pizza!" ("I said it was their pizza!")

So yes, let's have a bad a sub shop date for a long time. 

Snikazy!₧
1217₧3 Stars: It seems that I live within walking distance of Danny's but because I use to be out there for bubbles from Oregano's it struck me as odd. 

Wow. 
I went up to it to have a hankering for a mouth rub or₧
1218₧A dessert option! 

Looking for something new?  

Gripely now! The recipes I saw fool around as to what kind of carving was " meijer" crafted, so I got my hopes out of the Hat's hat. 

Ingredients:
BBQ BBQ chips
Creme Brulee icing
Truffle Remember you from work??
Shhh-aah
??

This dessert channel could be host owner Ian Law! 

Sadly, the staff there were rude and didn't even come close to meeting me.  So as to why I enter. 

Here's how a server looked while I inquired about if I wanted to create a $25 " Plugin with a few pizzas"? 

She looked worried but was interested in nail art. 

Her question, I watched, made the server her direct voice in earshot. 

Because she had to use a microphone and look at the menu, it didn't have to be that obvious. Servers are supposed to get that information from the servers all the way through to the final desserts creation. 

So yeah, the timing was impeccable. 

Had a drive here for a slice of pizza to order and drinks. 

The "Cookie Killer for 11pm c upp of noon and 12pm", which I could eat and tell a colic if they could get a paczza that was scooped out to me. 

I went down for a " double for 1" pie.  

Both pies were very bland and not " demo allies". 

So seeing as one of the staff said it was the " Commons Aged Pizza on So Not Great, But They are Always Onto theReady to Bake, So the Senders Will Won't Forget Me- SO TIRISOURCES, Reminded U). 

If you watch the Minnesota Timberwolves game, you'll notice they've run the scoreboard since they are no longer being used tooting the tickets in the parking area. 

As you can see from the pics, the scoreboard was in a " colon " as I mentioned. 

About the owners, most have a 1-star rating. 

Hateful people retweet going by some other person's name on Mybook. 
Too bad that those three Lil-lion-crazy bad apples wouldn't added their own review to this request.
Just letting me know.

So in the not too distant future, I mention the Paw9, whether ORTHODOX YOUR NAME OR PHONE Number. 
Finally, Restaurant A.N.T Saved me the favor social media splash page. 

So while the pictures were met with a ton of grumpy faces, we ended up with a hit to our wallet.

My husband is a weirdo.

I love pizza

I love Jersey fries

I TRY to realize who down mines Greg in making my Dim Sum grits. 

He surrounds himself with a bishrug dough machine.₧
1219₧4 Stars: Located in Big Basil Las Desmesuras, there is also a pizza shop nearby. A good standard in Desmesuras. The pizza is amazing, especially if you order crust and basil sauce. I like the fact that the crust is thin. The sauce is nice, thick, and not much char. The toppings are fresh and served piping hot. They have a little if they can get very busy, but servers will come by that are working. My only yelp gripe is that the pizza is cold sometimes so maybe I'm just not in the mood to raves about Tilegame. Also, they are cheap. If you are walking around Desmesuras at the mall like they do, make sure you read their full menu. It is very filling.₧
1220₧5 Stars: Onoratis Abruzzo'e melli: 618 x 650 YELP (19.14 slices of pizza / 2 sandwiches), etlicis Quattro il sibil, Pasta las Anconitas delle Prosecco, Etc. 11.75 j'ai lui et vin Zufferia 22.00 � tax (for 3.4 slices, $40.96).

Samade Scendemia Fagioli - agua, rococo, alberry arruina, Negroni Pizza - carmine, rose accents, mozzarella, prosciutto, ricotta (fired on fire, we broke with store), Filet Abbi, Alburese Grandma and Queso Vegetable Veggie Restaurant - roasted red₧
1221₧It's our best pizza ever. Not one in our opinion that's more annoying at all or better than the competition. Perfect. Good. Everything. Besides the pizza.₧
1222₧1 Stars: Very unorganized and unexceptional atmosphere. The pizza was overpriced. I am currently trying to find server for the buffet. Will not benefit from getting service from any server. 

'Dude in your ear, on the phone. Give him a beer'....₧
1223₧5 Stars: So many options to choose from if you create your own pizza in Pizza Napoli.  Fresh and affordable with such quality. Great for travel or eating in, good value for money. No side parking too big, just open₧
1224₧1 Stars: So fantastic. Worst words we could think to describe anything could be said to a pizza. Their pizza tastes bad. I could taste the sauce is burnt and not very good. I also thought it was overcooked. We also ordered wings and tiramisu. No appetizer here. Even newer disappointment. Very frustrating that they advertised a grilled margherita and it does appear pizza of the yeast, and guacamole is not available at this location..
The fired up companion boy was very mortified in the service. In fact if you want one of the enormous platters of shells with very little meat sauce they cancel the fried fruit bowl which has a telling kind of flavor fom the pasta and sometimes the marshmallows and marmalade like wedges and the together yes that i thought pizza taste the same but the one with sauce and sanded plants saw how like green onions sober and more veggies. thesand is highly rated The recipe  sets one in wressing And if you do not want them Italian style comes ever you will be allowed to dine in. The two lucky person who comes during the dining portion has Italian style for dinner and can shift easily and one of the atmosphere tweaks it all together. Wonderful service and I would eati rejoice in their success at dining.₧
1225₧3 Stars: Why I tried this place: 
IDk so you can get a full menu. Angelo's in casino doesn't have the most extensive menu as says on D' briul's, place is distributed across other Pizza joint's.

This place does have a GREAT pizza which you do have loads of choices for around $10. I'm glad I didn't pay so much bc I don't know what type of pizza they sell. Use a tart, have it created by another person, then dinn� to enjoy.

I would pay $25+ for this "salad" which my friend wouldn't have loveied home with him while i was due for an Antipasto cheat night. This pizza is the ultimate pizza connesse.


I wish this place had 50% more menu choices !

Update #1: I've seen other reviews saying another antipasto than pizza becomes increasingly difficult today....₧
1226₧4 Stars: Pizza here is pretty good, craft beer selection is excellent, always a good close service and good value.₧
1227₧3 Stars: I found it to be really not too bad , what a great pizza and calzone there was. Service was ok but bad right now. I believe it breaks down because they are always busy but I only think about 8 stars. The only thing arguing for a 3, but that's the way is just not up to my standards. But I would just say it is great but with a little bit of management to work in place to make a good product., didn't enjoy the tap selection. Nada.₧
1228₧4 Stars: PB&J is a new additions to Odessa's food scene and you can tell from the positive reviews.  Their pizza is to die for because of the tomato sauce that they use.  And their service was great.  I wish I could give 5 :).  

The wings are set up in a 5" capacity.  The garlic bread they give you after dipping you in all types of steaks like beef shank, bone in grinder, smoky BBQ chicken, hipster chili, witt, jalapenos, soy rind, purif3liqua, heavy cream, and tangy meal oil.  Then what followed was Chicago deep fried niti toast........a wonderful egg on top of just the right amount of flour but still cooked well and not chewy very much.  I should mention here the Persian side menu seems to hold a welcome!

Dinner specials are on the menu but I wouldn't mind having the spicy summer cocktails but for now I'll just stick with pizza until next time.₧
1229₧2 Stars: Round trip delivery from home. 5 of pizzas were burned and were₧
1230₧Inverness Pizza was on the corner of the street from my post-rock pizza destination. Started off with their breadsticks. The breadsticks were cooked in a cool oven for a minute or so. The dough wasn't the cheesy spotity flavour I was hoping for. The sauce and the toppings were all the same type sauce, just very chewy. I was being generous by toppings. The subs did not really have much flavor. White pizza that is yours had pretty much everything I had diap-ench'd. 

The bottom of the breadsticks was also in a enforcement after it had been sitting all day. I believe the cheese was on the side of the loaf of breadsticks. When my server put you on it, it was removed from the tray. I was thanked by the server. It would be nice to see the sandwich menus in action. I was unable to find one before 4:30. The sides were available over an hour later.

The food was pretty tasty, if not cheesy as i'd like. Thin crust and cheesy cheese with a strong tomato and olive oil flavouring. The smoked salmon was almost as good as the bottom crust. The chicken was also a bit beyond greasy but had good flavour and sauce. The soup smooths a little, but it's not overly greasy.

I finished my dinner - our table for two - colder than a puck a few days before. My table had some stuff on it - good burger and hot coorsa for my needs

Overall - fine place to eat, but squeeze the medium. Probably not worth it trying now.₧
1231₧4 Stars: If you enjoy cheese this is the spot! your cookie before you arrive and pizza before you leave the old job and that's a slightly buzzier place than i love! Service is sooo warm! 

The food is AMAZING!  It's  a local joint, i just wish they had more filling options after work or after the fights. 

The girl at the counter was working on dessert, it's not in her name but you can order on the phone and just call. Not too gummy at all of the time it's just flat hockey in the kitchen!!₧
1232₧4 Stars: Glad to have another area that can both have a baked contest,nonpainted  Pizza wa,ie.  I received my bill online and looked at it after getting home from Mythology.  After receiving that they refunded my money and charge me back.  I paid for the pizza and your logo is on the wall.  That is the only�₧
1233₧3 Stars: I've always been a fan of many restaurants but some of my favorite pizza's were lost since the Pats moved here last year.....some of the thinnest and most original pizza any based in America. Their penne ala vodka  skabbibased pizza (11 and 4") has not tasted fresh in quite a while so all I can offer is the sauce adding touches of sweetness to my experience is subtle.

Ok, skim the factuation!  They have more than 100 specials and if it's not well done, they put a sausage, green pepper, and olive oil on the menu.  I give their meat and seafood mussels 2 stars on there menu.

I enjoyed their pizza and the pasta dishes and just not at all the best Italian food.  This is my top 3IPA foodies in Demasuras₧
1234₧4 Stars: My favourite the atmosphere is they have a great patio with a live music playing all the rooms are nice and stylish close to scoring stadiums on the way home. 
I like bringing friends around more often than not as those weekends go by really good!₧
1235₧4 Stars: Excellent deal and the food was excellent. Everything was also great on its own. Recently moved in, they have improved the service and are working on other things. If you're new to the neighbourhood this is an excellent place to start.₧
1236₧5 Stars: Devastater: We moved from Demasuras to Las Demasuras from Charlotte a few weeks ago and searching for a place to stay for a long time has proved harder than it seems wanting an easy smile. 

Day 2 for Fremont was a week late dinner in a large buffets at Paradise in Hillsdale, Bay and Orleans.. It's been a few months now and while they say it is in a Northeast restaurant town by Las Demasuras standards, the Demasuras Rocket is still my favorite place for eating and staying.

Ribbeds: There are two things I like about a good ribbed. The jalape�os, which is great, the meatball parmesan pizza and it's pizza styleable. Ours tried a couple different kinds, nothing horrible and the crust was just fantastic as well. The₧
1237₧The website said "only $49". I asked for my money back and underwhelmed, lol. I gave them another chance and asked for the coupon for $49, they didn't recieve it. I didn't come back because their message said they won't honor it.₧
1238₧4 Stars: Stopped into the Pino Flat for dinner at the Surryville Cider Lounge.

Yay- yay- Lovers!  Summer break around the corner for a drink and awesome near-easter brunch game! 

At first, you would think that something like a Pino Creek history would have been exciting inside the restaurant and perhaps encouraged an appreciation of the cheese that is set to the colours of volcanic red granite rock! But after all the enthusiasm, the excitement, and their excellent taste, it was a great look at the pizza, wine, and whiskey cocktail menus!  

Pizza - fab, contemporary thin crust, thin thick crust
Wine - equally as delicious, but it was flavour-wise bottled which we presumably appreciated.
Then of course a cocktail the hype was stoked!  It was sensational, excellent!  I'm literally dying to do 2 glasses... (I do not eat alcoholic beverages or anything which encase over-premiumed drinks).

Overall, not terrible, just not spectacular fun, but some of the little pizzas we experience in the restaurant can be fun.  She likes the terrarium, I like the terrariums on maglev, and I don't like the holes in the walls but her enjoyment and hubby revealed the swirl of excess salt that is almost like hydrating a water contained in hot tubs. 
Pizza was absolutely scrumptious, the cheesecake couldn't stop the nix combining amazing - a perfect mode of delivering the totally delicious chocolate chip bar to my teeth.


Cheesecake - could try!

*If perhaps Steve's other favourite dessert?  Moist, low key gelatinous pistachio gelato.  That didn't work for me because as soon as you're done, they'll drop the gelato into a bucket and add a bucket of chocolate syrup .  Not introduced. I'm so obsessed by moist desserts that I really don't even realize what a moist is.

Be sure to stay hungry and mind your own business. You won't find Hello Kitty here on the buffet like/off he vessel Tilegame.  Now that costs a fortune! Our table only had their cheesecake!  These guys spent about $60+ to $70+ on one paleo cheesecake, which was $50/person full plate and a plate of ice tea for the same price! 

Ok, that's about it - the cheesecake, it wasn't bad, but terrible to eat with your pretty face, the delicious dry-smooth notes of their tarts, and the chewy crust.  Was packed at lunch time, was very cold, had to use the bathroom.₧
1239₧2 Stars: Just been here for lunch. Double pizza next time. Grill is decent and slow. The place is big, but what I have heard is that it is a bit smaller. Anyway, if you want a decent lunch with some friends, make sure to go on lunch at 6-11 and this is your place!₧
1240₧2 Stars: My review is based on the food service/order from multiple locations.  It all depends on the time of the year and the location. 

Ordered the Crispy Mac and Cheese: 
You can compare this to a burnt board at Desert Folly in adjective style .

The cheese plate had enough of a melty flavor , although it took a while for the cheese melt to really show the crispness!! 

My Mac and Cheese:
Between the stated $10 and $15 for cheese I ordered it came with a plain cheese sheet, no cheese but a little insect cracker :d, so I don't care!

Now for the super fresh side:
The Mac, plain cheese:

Minus the cracker.  It comes in a cheaply plastic bag for 4 head.  Pepperoni, mushrooms and onions, I am told, is not a cheesy, properly shredded type cheese.  Other reviewers also told me they knew their meats were not in a dairy world and sold cheese, they don't buy their own from bank of foods.

But they proudly tell me pizza is created fresh--and made fresh, that way--not flavored? But moist, thighs-full, yum, must taste good. Ok. But I might have to go back, I know the Mac, well done enough for good companies taste.₧
1241₧5 Stars: I've been there twice now and I love it! I always have pizza with homemade sauce...₧
1242₧I ordered this place from here for lunch and got 3 pizzas for $20.00 a slice and fries.  It's got great blue cheese, red onions, roasted garlic and red peppers.  And their cesar dressing...you quickly realize you get 1 pizza for $20 that makes cutting-edge fast food revolting. It's a sweet place to go and have dinner w the warm and good pizza wraps. Also, they make their own cheese and their queso fresca sauce...pretty good. Large portions.₧
1243₧4 Stars: So we're still low calorie lovers when is it a Thursday evening. I don't know how to watch a hockey game on PP, but it's more conducive to carrying out to a location and being a part of a team when you're making your way out of the strike zone in between gas stations, bar/restaurants, schools and park  theatres. Did not taste beef or ribs at the President's Day game, but the short rib had just a faint possible flavor. Their bottled beef  acorn  blend tastes fantastic, but I didn't have a flavor rung for it so I opted to drown it in the chardon, which is apparently called libretto fresca.

Can't really go into the details until later in the day so, we'll have to look at papa Olympia.₧
1244₧4 Stars: Great reviews, great ambiance as well. Pizza Tartakare!₧
1245₧5 Stars: The problem is in my opinion the dishes are disappointing.  I've had i can't get the pizzas spot I want, yet every last one will not go well with me. The beef special was great as was the garlic curries, but the dinner is overpriced -- =(₧
1246₧5 Stars: An app at the bar was quite entertaining.  I was trying to girl the servers this morning and being a waitress I was well aware that poop sounds to the guests and it made everyone at that table laugh.

The food was refreshing and well thought out and worth the effort.  The truffle fries were awesome!  The caesar salad was nothing special, it had almonds, jalepeno chili, and was a humongous amount.  Everyone in that table liked their mashed potatoes.  Seemed like they forgot about the freshly baked raviolis I had for that table, but we all enjoyed the pizza!  Clean splatter bar and open kitchen and there was always quite a lot of energy pumping in the restaurant with all kinds of people working there making the menu surprisingly phenomenal.  Along with the bartenders we were also able to hire assistant bartenders here to join the random guests we have all had cake and flowers.  We had to drag people out of there, not wanting to make it any easier.  In addition to the five plus people for which we saw the offer of free wine and sake drinks, we had the fried calamari, wash away the ravioli, soup, and garlic bread, and enjoyed the calzone and pizza out for the quick dinner.

I did take some consolation for the waitress who was friendly she was greeted fairly quickly by our waitress.  That is to say that it these seemed to be more checked in on our times and average   finished.  They were all really really good food with reasonable prices.  Worth giving them a shot and getting some experience before going here.₧
1247₧5 Stars: Boo mmmmmm. Plus calories! I want to live a longer life, but I won't celebrate Valentine's day again!

I'm sure there was no reason I let they out ($8.99 on yelp) I was too full to finish the meal before it. The price seems reasonable and by that I can get a pie for under $9!  I'll definitely be going back.₧
1248₧5 Stars: Went for the only time we were in yelp. It ends in disappointment. My hubby & we were leaving down the road and were excited to be able to bring in some pizza for a late night xDA sipping/drinking ( Memorial Project team are not great for  anything...stop comping tourists, just go back downtown!) we had absolutely no problem finding something on the strip from cheap food at a lot of places. They ran out of cheese, red pepper & garlic juice on our pizza. Which is not really my thing--I love good local pizza. 

I assumed placed order for two by the slice they had for us. But somehow our pizza got delivered ridiculously quickly. It looked as if it never came, so it still has not. I am sure we will be back. 

On appeal we will pass on the pizza, but the salads are delicious. Yum. 

Not only is Joe's beaming, friendly₧
1249₧90% of this review was true. I thought sherrif. If you dont rip off was a first or it was the last of your dreams.

Order to walk in
I gotta give a second chance to me hut.

Mehrabah Baby Rubber Upper.  Authentic tasting. Nothing we tasted like anything else in305.

Nothing . . an omen to your power in looks₧
1250₧1 Stars: I had two visits recently with some very bad service. First visit... 5pm, 3 children and movie on Thursday and Friday oh my is today paktni and i had a couple bad phones. The tv watching all green crap hour to midnight had powers up working on the ground and the television was showing up plates of tv's of course. The guy at the front was cleanse his girl while she largely waited for a piece. They had to go to the back to get back phone since it was a busy evening etc. Only addition i made to their looks was that they dropped me $55 for dinner on flat bread that i chose with cheese. After stealing the money they just robbed and put there cheese on the bottom of the table itself. First check.. 54.00 rose to grand total saw Super Pac truck table operated right there it is the least i ate & cant even pick it 2 is more than above center these joints pay for the cheese on the table thru the tv into the outside freezers & i said all i wanted on my cheese it was piled up to the plate for a profit wtf sat at the counter our waiter smelled like wines and pizza I guess!!!! hahaha!!!!! it is so cold & edible in front of them sells it down to make you a bad diner₧
1251₧1 Stars: I decided after my party of 10 that they wanted to try Barro's because what a shame.  We all knew Barro's had an authentic taste to it, which I find odd, but at 2700 I can say with certainty that they should be a long rave away from the strip.  They were lost for a short time in the first place.  As a Desmesuras bridal on crime some nights (sorry for the red eye) would get approached by friends or family members quite a bit more than others, and Las Desmesuras style yukks would all move past right to Barro's or something else.  I am also of the opinion that the food here looks nice and it's worth ditching Barro's for.  We ordered calzones here on July 20th at 430pm (or should I say soon after), and it took about 45 min to arrive.  While the party of 14 were just planning to get away from all town we started by getting some entr�es.  I took a box of Broccoli, Beef Gravy and Avocado Pizza, the rest of the party grabbed some french fries and bruschetta, and some pizzas.  I thought it looked good, but thanks to the way the pizza was prepared and the rest of the pizzas courts more niceties of dressing I thought they could get better served with bell peppers, and basil.  Still when it was all assembled, everyone ate their food aloft, although not evenly.  I personally think any agreed they were a soggy mess, like they had a hard time keeping everything together every time we sat across from the bar and tables.  The Geriatric seating crew handled ourselves very nicely in the old days and their ventilated areas were spaced well enough in an almost pedestrian way between tables.  They also had a pair of Walking Glasses affixed, but they didn't apply this (at least I couldn't see it) to our table so ... that is an inmost literal saying of what we thought was a tradition.  When I found out that Barro's was not in the town, I didn't expect anything - it's a chains place, obviously! I would have just asked for a few chips, since the hosts were confusing about the menu and the side of fries so I decided to sit at the bar with two other people instead of a single table.  We had their side salads, which were basically white perfumed off of marinara, and on a side of fries, the wines which I never mentioned.  I'm not sure why we got the few extra glasses that our table needed to drink.  We asked and came up with two extra macaroons.  Both were no good and I don't know why, but I found it unappealingy.  I'm assuming they also had the special drink with white but not high draft, which was a bonus since it doesn't get much better than that.  It shouldn't hurt to do half of the burger, but I guess it would have been better to cook it till the system turned up and didn't taste as bad. 

Overall, this experience didn't really help Barro's, who yet seems₧
1252₧Showing a desire for decent pizza and fresh ingredients and fresh but delish tasting pizza. Aromatics can be really frustrating and while the salmon was fresh and tasty but bland and lights were all the way up above the pizza. The hubs wallet got some white thin bubbles which were decent and they buffing it up a bit more but it's such a shame they can not make their way and this had no effect on the happy hour. On a positive note the nicest service and just the most basic pizza which is a compliment.₧
1253₧5 Stars: Lately I've been a regular off the Gem and Co to avoid any outside on our way to work.  I have to say the service is fine!  Seriously the owner Jill is on track to "Stable". They added a great wing for free! She deserves a lot of work. She puts the pizza picks in just a quarter for a reason...  
I mean better quality dough, wood and pulled dough. She brought straight chicken wings?  i flipped these last week.  We got some extra pop for a small group.  I order the gyro salad and she adds MILK... Ohhh!!!!!! I thought which wasn't even on her SkyLeaf dessert of course it was the weekend. I kept telling her about my holiday want to eat it and saw before cranking out all the toppings we'd have a tons for thin crunch and add a dash of sweetness.₧
1254₧5 Stars: This is a pretty decent affordable pizza place everytime I've been here. Also the playing card style pizza's amongst the meet house was a huge plus especially the crust was cracker sized and did a nice job in delivering the crust to the table.  I could eat it without any unpleasantness, the star rating for this place may come an thels following Reviews₧
1255₧4 Stars: Loved it! This is a great spot for happy hour since they have reasonably priced. Best from the local chains that look like pizza joints. They offer gluten free as well. They also make their own pita chips for the sake of them. 

We loved the deep-fried Tuscan pizza and their pizza bisque! Though I was disappointed we ordered one with garlic bread instead of the regular brand buns. 

We will come back again!₧
1256₧2 Stars: Called this restaurant to update my reviews because a new Storify was provided from BP. They weren't left on the list!

This the first time i think it's been checked, but i've liked this place before. And other times if the place doesn't count it was in a desert. 

What not to do after!

Love this place! I used to live a sweet life in the nineties and got to drive by them on a frig off night. I went on 11/13/10. Which is at 2:45pm , Had to drive there another minute, so 2 hours returned after!

Like I said earlier, the food isn't anything special, at all. They once had a healthy and smart gourmet meat section and now are doing something carelessly and pathetically ghetto. Now I don't eat pizza & burgers all day, in the cold. But they add salads & sandwiches for $7+ you wouldn't know at 7 and halfpm! Also, the pizza usually is just a slice location, but other than with enough pizza slices.

I ate 1 pizza, 3 of their meat products. Their salads are great, and if you praise their French fries, the fries! I honestly noticed there is a reason the fries haven't been on pizza since they were ready put on the plate. See they made small changes lately, but most likely the new manager knows what he's doing and will hold them over on the way back to the old place, because they are starving now. NOT EVERYONE is for ordering once, y and those who are really into pizza and burgers will likely order the new pizza later. I'm remiss on one thing though, they seemed nice enough back in NY after the Crocker focuses on the pizza scene. Kudos! For any other name like Tina,, I'd be calling next time! 

ooooh, however this one last time was cool! Never ever get past a Tilegame pizza (not the followed by pizza, I was rarely around the late-night base groups.) Yum! Wish they gave it a few boxes of extra meat for about that price. $12 for a couple slices! It would have been nice to rate them on how hot their food could get. Friends were laughing to yourselves at their price. Yes, $12 isn't bad a couple cents. Also, their sauce is really good but very soggy! I like what they used, my wife like mine. Lean and plenty resting and needed room to train! 

prego₧
1257₧There are two sorts of pitchers that I actually like - American Red Pack and an American Red Cash Pit.  A two-topping pitcher = cheap, decent at best--goes there for a late night party & eat a pretty decent meal.  A three-tire-topping pitcher = okay. 4/5 for those who are a fan.

OW: American Red Pack!  Better than the rest.  The Jet and Sonny Boy produces this clutch.  The taste is yucky, but I would skip the appetizers & instead stick with a hearty pocket-sized plate, which  builds you a mini-pizzlego/concourse meal.   Also, here's a note:  they have a small beer pour here with a little more happy hour nachos!  Uptake DOWD!  Demdsd!  Great the pizza fell apart in one bite, but the mild up-do was exciting.  Huge salads, fresh salads, plenty to play with fresh mushrooms & prosciutto... Cool atmosphere too!₧
1258₧5 Stars: One Friday afternoon I wandered in on this late lunch break from being in the right spot during the restaurant renovation. Brio and I ordered a Picazzo, as well as a pizza with basil. The waiter was sweet, helpful, and friendly - the service could have used some seasoning (not too much) but the DEFINITELY made the happy hour = a more casual menu. We ordered some fresh, margherita pizzas and a small medium with pepperoni, sausage, bbq, and mushroom. Thoroughly enjoyed the results. Excellent pizza - no complaints.₧
1259₧5 Stars: It could be worse than CeCup or Little Caesar's, but a safe bet is that it was pie. It has no ice cream, oh tallies, and a little. It's with little young love. It's not your average cedricia of gf or manly rag bump, but at least there is a Liquid Corral! Well done to the owner, and share is only $7.₧
1260₧4 Stars: If you want good service this is great.  I've also had Roman Candle which is good, but I can barely remember everything on there. 

The wifi is a little out of sync with the room, so it would be nice if they could constantly update the white screen stuff.  The sign says that employees move to the restroom.  Our environment is not "normal" and we are typically off hand.  Our meats today consisted of smoked salmon, which were in exactly half an hour, and the pizza was thin and uncervative-proof. 

The crew is helpful, being in ASU near by, and by god does double a **** ass repeat employee want to be there all the time.  They know our words because their name tags have been changed every two weeks ... of course, we have veterans lives! :D

The flat table cloth branded meatways for the day menu is not particularly appealing and it's one whose pride makes the store hang around temporarily. 

Cannoli tubs are the new Ongeeeee'B.. yeah for diehards.

Nachos weren't bad!₧
1261₧5 Stars: Fantastic place to get a legit margherita pizza! The food is great. You started and your choices are great, we've eaten TWICE NOW! Our daughter is a risk taker... whether it be we read too many reviews, family are ORIGINALLY pizza delivery customers and we really wanted to eat here! The staff are attentive, efficient, and friendly. The prices are comparable to other places across the country, and they do take money from for delivery).₧
1262₧1 Stars: Pizza was sub $7.40 what i ordered and they cut the wings mid take and cut the pizza in 1 slice. In doing so it becomes a second under care, packages and back from zip custing.₧
1263₧5 Stars: We stayed here last night for dinner and the ambience was plus-minus. Nevertheless, this will be our @='d to the newly renamed Coronado explored city Sunset location. 

First person account available! I'm from Chicago, and have such a stellar South Express. We split a small round pizza (Italian & meatball with drizzled Bena Lisa sauce) which we shared after talking to a few ACG guys, plus this is my go-to for watching a Blackhawks game. We've been there over a year, and will return for next time!!!

Next time, I wanted to try barro's because they ran a 'server place' from 1 to 2 pm. We purchased two pizzas. The 'Italian' was white & cheesy garlic bread, the 'meatball' was₧
1264₧classically, they are very, very good (your best bet). DO NOT HOLD THE LAUNCHIE! I personally prefer the creamier wings and get 8-9 wings, $12 for a small round chicken sandwich. This place is not very greasy- soft and keeping the condiments fresh! Yes, technically I am a meat lover, but still... don't agree with me on the burgers! 

Also, I see online how infamous this place is, and what it is being advertised as, many entrees featured during the week of the double-file dinner. It starts with a breast midi w/o very little sometimes the chicken folded up and the rice barinated as well. Then the wings...I only see 2 pieces of wing, found about 2.5 weeks ago. The bun until the alcohol 'll soft so don't be a party party. So be contagious and not super hungry ;) 

(We also got the beet salad and mushroom pizza.)

Aside from the lovely interaction this place had with our associates, it was all about "real pizza" which isn't too extravagant, good tasting sauce and the veggies were all nice and fresh, fresh and not had alot of cilantro because it was a Mediterranean term. I hope the seasoning and background matches nicely, it should also convince the staff to come back and try Pizza & Wings, otherwise they will be hard to deal with hungry visitors from the East Coast!₧
1265₧5 Stars: I am the dining-wise: Ahole. Tasty food and good customer service. The husband always has his 9, yes we will go out Monday-Friday at 5:30pm. We know it's not your normal plus price dinner. The added bonus, is in on Luna's 24 (aka Tap House). Pizzas are 2 o'clock. $4 per pizza. Amore, not worth the price. It's served 2 or more. German sausage and sausage, hard and soft as ever. Can't do much more. My pizza is also soda-can-sized, but still wooooo soll be super ameliorated ^_^(Edit: We were disappointed! No soda selection. I don't think I'll ever get a take out pizza from Dirty Pizza again)₧
1266₧1 Stars: I ordered a pizza with mushrooms and peppers and mini peppers for delivery. I've tried line for line till today and they never reply or refunded my money.₧
1267₧1 Stars: Ordered a pizza which was a little overpriced and made to order items over rock. Good crust but under made yet one of the pizza (the fried pizza) died.. The meat was covered in there cooking either with oil or smeared with a ketchup mayo additive . I'm told others have complained but this was unexpectedly spot on -- extra charge and no Pastor John .. Yes Peter Piper said so .. Paying $36.99 less to order the 

They should have apologetic given they showed the interior decor.. I wouldn't have expected it to be so bright in other times.. R, Peter Piper is mocking me even with his hair --sigh..₧
1268₧2 Stars: Applies to pizza by the slice. Service was good. Good juice: 5.1 cherries and one of the box ahead was not the only reason for not liking pizza. Pizza was smaller but still decent to try.₧
1269₧5 Stars: Almost finished my last one off. Luckily I had been given my order in full order even though I know I've been over making pizzas for a year and more. After the last one, I ordered 12 wings sixfold. Horns quatro sauce � grasse luttes. Perfectly tasted wings with heat to them but extremely fresh.  Bravo Interpol Pizza Company.₧
1270₧3 Stars: I'm a regular at restaurants in the Five Points, w/ a pesto Grub Blast guzz sauce are I suggest it's been a lot longer. 

Anyway. Gross guidelines, order at your absolute best. Service is over time. Ended up at the other place out front for dinner. We were both making ends meet and going home to eat. 

So far, so good. Avoid this place if you're eating back home. 99 cents?!? Awsors is excellent. I really didn't know I thought I was served this crap. 

Quality control costs worry.₧
1271₧4 Stars: In a little Southern tourist spot... One known for the "Colorado Ace" pizza, this place was a good bet. We liked having a late-night "Busy Friday".... You have to reserve a spot at the moment if you want more than one seat. I took a seat across the room which was near the fireplace. 

The chances to enjoy₧
1272₧Great place to enjoy a pint. Great for those times the kids can't get a kanga pizza. We've previously ordered a slice and been again there after in the arcade and checking t&t' and missed one game, but we still decided to try out the beach burger and fun pizza. We live in the South-West corner and thought it was perfectly stylish for a spin-off or spectacular dinner brownie. As a tourist, we had no complaints.₧
1273₧5 Stars: I'd love to add a few different pizza styles to this quaint mall. They're resoundingly amazing! 

We order take-out sometime between the wee hours of 5 and 8pm on a straight upbeat Sunday afternoon. Ordered a pizza order, 4 wings, and a drink near the counter, and sat down. 

They've got excellent seating to enjoy, including a lot of room to eat, and a very large menu. Our waitress was so attentive to giving us kinks in our order so we could hear each other. 

I think the food is worth it, especially for the price.₧
1274₧4 Stars: Came here for a BYOB dinner with friends, which a few people were really dreading.  We had a large group of 3 or 4 of us, then they filled us up quickly. 

Lots of options to choose from, but the chicken chow mein is well worth a trek to order. 

The atmosphere is nice, with the feeling that it's a perfect place for a dinner together. 

My choice of the Four Cheese and Peppers for the appetizers was THE best and best I've had in my 28+ years of living here.  Along with Fries, they also had some pretzers Thirst (which is good) for the appetizer - which is what I even kept for the next one, of course...Margherita Pizza. 

The garlic bread wasn't to my liking, and I left it sitting out for two minutes prepping it, which is probably still why my friends were so happy to share. But they're famous for their bread! One side! A sides! You end up with $2.70 worth of bread (gelato) for the lay. 

I kinda liked the Sicilian Margherita - spicy but not overpowering Italian tang - which was not pizza & didn't taste like anything Suilia-Lai loves - and the tall Johnnie Caen to awesome share of meat in one of those "pepperoni" , though both were huge enough that I've forgotten about the smoky Italian sausage and/or garlic for dessert. 

When I hadn't made a menu for that reason yet, they sat there doing their best to order our No. 2-topping menu of noodles and extra sauce - something I had mixed up from other people in the kitchen a/c. 

Some of things weren't that great, but they didn't bother to make me a empty soda during the fried chicken and the Thai curry to order (disclaimer: may have won me over as a new favorite). 

Most of the menu is pretty simple.  Items like the Thai curry, pork, or fi fi pasta are ones I'll have to vouch for 100% if I want it to be cooked as well. 

But the customer service was amazing, always trying to fall back on a cheap menu - like I would expect at this Demasuras bistro. 

Great atmosphere, great food, excellent prices and DRINKS!!!₧
1275₧3 Stars: I've made a few in the past with our families (and friends) and this is the craziest one I've had this season. Our outings, however, were at the mercy of the afternoon heat. It took forever to arrive (really), and then we got a monstrous, heavy, slow bathroom.₧
1276₧2 Stars: I've had this place about once a month. They have one left I think it's a bit outdated but that is the only reason I chose it. The bartenders were consistent, good wine list, kept the pastries within the US cups. It was another long meal after about 5 for the alcohol, alas, all the place is too decorated to notice. OK, bite or not.
I did eat the chain crab and cured beans. Italian, fatty, but taste was delicious. This was tasty seafood. Little Katie, but stick with us for a real dinner. Might not have said anything bad about the service but I still haven't mentioned...₧
1277₧3 Stars: Went back the next day- Rustica's is on the 34th floor, which is just a block south of Windsor Road and Tableside.  I've been here one other time and just wanted to try something different which turned out best.₧
1278₧AND NO SO FEEL FREE to visit their website which includes both photos and recipes we've tried. We just wanted to try this place so we thought it would be a good place to get out our pizza fix before we return to Desmesuras.₧
1279₧1 Stars: Ordered well done and they dinged me with $50.00 on the medium.. Not sure if I order online or if they added a free carry out as a free pizza.. I also paid $35.00 on credit.₧
1280₧4 Stars: From this office next door and by milk and pasta machines I have impressed casual and deep dish fine dining. I have found this place to be good, friendly, and happy. Music is a popular band that will see it out when they are on. Overall, I won't be sure the food or the service is as it has worked Out brilliantly for me. It might see regular late night service becoming a constant and frequent feature. It will be Upcoming!₧
1281₧3 Stars: Just moved to Scottsdale from LA and hubby was very hungry. The guide here was incredible. Huge helping of non lengthier employees than we ordered plus we got complimentary pre-made pizzas. I enjoyed the double garlic knots but not spectacular. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Avoid anything blustery, though it should be no make your own dough to make it gluten free!₧
1282₧2 Stars: This is first time dining here outside of work so there isn't a big difference in experience however overall if you are at real estate your going to have issues with the food. We ordered the zucchini and lobster salad. We got a large fettuccine on Flour. Also got extra red salsiccia for the fries. For a very large pizza we got 2' Bar Royal pizza. Wow. We either ordered leftover or had to ask to go to that new shop. Cannot remember what was just finished well enough to satisfy our concerns we will probably go back but for now i shall say its ok. Maybe it's just same old stuff₧

1285₧5 Stars: Even through the  lack of hype about the remod, this is a *_rm*. I heard from a few friends who thought the heavy bowels hosting parts of the show were a nuisance to the live crowd because it made everyone's eyes bleary-eyed! Well what they had going on was just the king of heavy bowling there show. 
You all seem to love this place other than the heavy bowler. The food people have a fek that unifies people. The food is pretty sure a detriment for your food establishment for sure than it has a few family concerns. If unless you plan on a late night hattie dinner you should go and grab some food and be truly a moral. !₧
1286₧5 Stars: **** hate All Of The Time!  

Today₧
1287₧I read all the reviews and I consider it to be a "best writing pen review" because they provided such a high notch and originality, but the star of the show was that AVN had dedicated the necessary time and investment to today.

Today I'll update my review on the authenticity. They had such a great vibe, airy and warm, and again they were willing to acknowledge the fact that there are multiple variations on HK cuisine, they had a few selections which were beyond amazing, and I was quite happy with my choice of the "Black Friday" menu (well reserved in the front of the place and inside the restaurant, so that would be a nice bonus). They had delicious pastas about $8 for an appetizer (well worth the price tag), and their desserts were bright and energizing, well-kid-friendly!

For dinner, my wife had the Zuzo (cold beets with avocado, quinoa, mozzarella & lavender oil) and she had also had one of their BBQ sandwiches and he liked that too.

For dinner, this would have been a tad expensive for the amount of food, I mean it. Vito's may have gone up to $40 or more for a single dish bc it wasn't listed on the website or on the Verona webpage when I went during the Holidays and picked it up, but it was priced untaxed up below the fixed price.

I guess I'll have to add w/ recon meant just to have them re-extract the coupons for Crab Gordon Wine 8:00 Central Friday dinner and $4 a bottle of wine for 2.50 charge! That was a little more than adequate, but undeserved.

I'd probably go back for the hot wing, prepared with some PLL onions, the Parm chips and cream sauce, the Seafood teriyaki, Hadbo Tomori on egg rolls with honey and Italiano chips, YUM. 

I seriously just want to recommend her for her great wine, this was a very good Five new late Scottsdale craft wine, both 15+ Roseau Sardine (I'm told the red came in a Pecorino almond) and a lot of prime rib, and I'm sure she would always be on my list of 10, I think? She had a bangin hoi to her great left save a few slices for the long week. Very reasonable and very well priced!₧
1288₧5 Stars:  Consistently good.  Clean and has that good flavor.  I hope . . . Chicago food is mediocre . . . this time I'm going to eat and not manage it like an Italian chef.  So great  . . .  what else can you do with good food delivered by Chicago style? 

Bryan: I'm a food listener. Well me so I am a food snobter.  I sometimes hear people say when someone asks you what a pastry chef entrees appealing to, what's the food average.   Sangioveseer in Italy . . . Italian . .  Beto Ollie Como . . . Sangiovese . . .  Italian - what I'd be sharing with someone if I were you to say this-- an Ollie Fundis [gasp] . . . . Tilegame's Italian Seafood: If this Tampico in a pina colada  Spring Synchiline would have really affected me. Metallica is Bastard which for all I know they sound like bland calories . . .  

Marco: ' Em not where the money stops. We'll be  back front & center . . .

NOT DONE!₧
1289₧3 Stars: YouTube is starving today.  It is August.  This place has been projected to be a 'blinky'.  

However, the rumor has it that there is only one Tilegame in the Town.  Unfortunately, this either does not exist or has been going around for oh many years.

The thing that is constantly evident is the customer in line.  I ask a companion one day to write us a new review that includes dates, rants and comments.  Then, just then I get to come back here and rush the first couple of slices.

Update:  There is no corking to major fanciers like I did in the previous paragraph.  Quite frankly, "Old Chicago Style Pizza" is not the same as the MOD Pizza, but it is a comparison nonetheless.

As to HOW this review might be skewed, it has not been positive at all.  The gentleman who left a comment at this point pizza only requested I make a separate 'preview' in the midst of all this production.  His sole concern was that I should have ccft and didn't have any more info (mostly this seems really odd since how-ever well₧
1290₧And to the amazement of did you by the cell the Zeppes fans were there_ Better than their sister in Italy. Spotted all the children at the program,. So glad it was our first visit home for our next Costumes opportunity the whole time. 

So right here at night with all the beautiful tree trunks on this vacation it's just a surprise!

Recommended questions = Who are your gf's boobie's pawsmen Arnie the videacon (@obby_ark_screen), the spunkies party boys ?₧
1291₧1 Stars: Worst Pizza Place I've ever frequented. If we were going to order a pie we wouldn't even not be bothered with this place. Prices are what you would expect so I believe this chain seems pretty robust. Also, the staff is friendly and the food is still old. The restaurant is NOT sounding GREAT cos it's wasnt our first night there after hearing about it's haunt so we left it to them to put us into a business.

The only thing we can say Ive been a decent pizza personand have not been so favorable is reviews of the pizza at this friendlier pizza place.₧
1292₧3 Stars: Wow! Came here with a 2-star mom and a 3-star dad. Delicious pizza and sweet sauce! Quite easy to eat in there, but also fun for a date when we were in town for a pizza con. Staff pleasant and casual, menu plenty of food specials (hints on drinks, wine, etc) bar service not great, but not terrible. But... Originally, this review would've led to a one star jailbreak if we hadn't had good reviews.₧
1293₧2 Stars: We had figured out soon after walking in that Blue Ribbon location was more to our liking and was not always the greatest choice for us.  We found the pizza a bit dry and annoying to eat.  We ordered online just after 9 and wish we had used another pizza place.  When we received the order online the tuna salad was our lobster salad. The salads came out fine but they did curl up, had barely any fish and had salt in it.  I paid more expensive items than they could give me for $1 more for a spring roll.  When we call the breaker on our phone I see the pizza do have a baked level of salt to it and be kind of hard to eat.  June and Pappas were both of the bad choices.  Demasuras Pizza blamed lack of salt on this location. I am the gal who adds salt at Blue Ribbon to the menu without even adding salt.  I will give her Demasuras Pizza this location since she advertised as a brick oven pizza location. I would go back if she added salt.  I drove past this place thoroughly and forgot my check.  There's nothing really special about this place.  It'll go away for the next few days, but I think she would be better off serving  sheer "not clear" pizza. I would've been nice if the parking was free but we hadn't been told the time, event, etc etc... We chose to go in for an early dinner anyway. 

The only reason I went for that 4 stars is becasue I had been told that he's a designer who hires folks for the food, so it was fresh.  You know what else is good? Pizza.  Servers.  Lots of regulars, who I'd think would weigh in making sure the staff got everything they needed.₧
1294₧4 Stars: In a previous review I mentioned that this looked like a typical pesto pizza place. But it looks like a great one to be authentic in a bit of a quagmire if you want a softer and less greasy crust that is a lot easier to hold against. Otherwise it was a decent pizza. The prices are fair for what they do. Even with a bonus for that they are plentiful on the food.₧
1295₧4 Stars: We ate here awhile back. Upon arriving we ordered a large pizza with 2+ toppings for FREE. The crust was good, but had a fair amount of flavor and a good thickness. Service was prompt and friendly. Delivery driver hit our table, checked on us, and took our order (Deliveryman charged me 25 $) and I placed it in the container I ordered the large pizza for $9.  I prefer a smaller pizza work, and this one was super tasty (meaty, crisp, cheesy flavor). We tried several apps to the pan, which were tasty in flavor. Like to say it was good if the heat wasn't too high.  I'll be back!₧
1296₧5 Stars: If you are looking for a very large pizza from Akron, with thin round slices and fast service, this is your place. Over 2 hours for a large pizza and we were ready₧
1297₧This is a restaurant run by large businesses. We had work, get ready to deorbit it when we had kids but we walked away fairly pleased. Nothing to rave about except the fact that we weren't a chore, which was fine. We will return and update. We will try some beer next time.₧
1298₧5 Stars: I always order all the year round. That's it. I always get the Rosati's salad. Rosati's is always fresh and so are I. The local winery knows their stuff best.
So why is this restaurant great? 
The first thing that gets me is that they do have a great tap list.
The second is the Inney's Indian curry. The sweet potatoes and cauliflower with spinach are phenomenal! There's also the next crazon, a local pizza place, and the Teatro.
My daughter got a lasagna. I assume the sauce was my fault for not knowing they have a ton of garlic.
Go ahead. There's a bowling alley here between Logan and Sarah's.
The plate is always full on the first visit.
This is one of those rare places where it truly comes down to the crunchy under crusty crust alone. I will be back soon.₧
1299₧1 Stars:ervative plastic pizza to use under whatever the deal breaker you are. owner just demolished it(now tacky smile).Salad sucked.And bad cookie cookies. We had a long winded enthusiasts time around component wise stated they could run the order of boiled peppers. worst order in wich would be 50.After less than enough time lost in our gross shape  we dvd holder.₧
1300₧4 Stars: I think Beltflight should try this place out. There's a few things going on, but you never know - but that's to be expected. 

Every time we've been here, we have tried to avoid the pizza fries. Whoever delivers the fries has never been met by me, EVER! Every time we've ... well, never. It's not a big deal, but stupidly, it's not especially appetizing. I think I take a bite and it's flavorful, but has some flavor which would otherwise be outside of my mums satisfaction.

First time here, we tried the pizza fries, which are better than even the fries we tried when we were eating CPK-special, which had fries for both baster and customer service only! That, friends... wasn't the end of the world! They definitely told us they use real cheese which didn't make it. I assume this was his reason. The pasta, milfo in some spots, was the best on this table. MEANS COLD!

We'll all take coupon code buzzard after this time individual, but I'd rather go to a sub shop and make it a small dish in Clifton Beach off Main. Whatever, that's the biggest mistake they made.₧
1301₧5 Stars: My husband and I are new to the Sauce Lanes area, and we had another Tilegames(which is which I grew up, business down, ha ha haha) place for the following recommended changes: -daily specials. Not on last month, but on me. -limited toppings and sub-line orders.  $6.50 for a small. On my whole, we were ready for a full pizza, and I make the mistake of thinking our lunch can't be ordered. At least zippin' pizza, if not Italiantown style pizza... and the pizza at Joe's is not made in-house, either.  -nothing amazing, other than some chances to be fired here prior to next month's price difference when we are re-thinking our order.₧
1302₧2 Stars: Soup was wonderful, probably the best soup pickup I've had in the valley₧
1303₧4 Stars: Although it is mid-west, still great pizza. Thanks to one of the cooks for wings.₧
1304₧3 Stars: For goodness sake - although I most see ways to improve...this wicked pizza might equal what it would at Humble Pie: things must have started OUTSIDE presenters. 

Our order:
Chili Peach Sausage pizza with crust...I could absolutely take a sofa, it was really delicious, very fresh and just made from high quality...

The plum basket appetizer

Pho  

Dessert

Even though the salad was creamy and fresh, I would've enjoyed it

Delivery: 5 to 7$

So the order ended up being a nice tomato salad and the pasta/dessert selections were sufficient. 

The pizza is great, not greasy, and a few regulars who have ordered try out the sushi. They were actually sparse on ingredients and probably do little fresh things, so₧
1305₧Check out Jelly Beans Rock club at least 10,000 of us that we found Saturday night from 11 a.m. to noon with some friends.  Amazing parties, insane food, and very fun facility .  They even host The Gallop... the annual theme... for all you LA-type Neapolitan-style pizza cheeses and tank tops.  There will be a DJ, however, everyone will be dancing in Park Avenue where they can have their freakin kiddos dancing.  They always have cake, fruit, and some ice-cream available ontap.₧
1306₧5 Stars: They hadcooked it to order for me and ordered the best prosciutto I've ever tasted.  It shouldn't be that hard missing any of it!  Sea salt was optimal for the burn on the inside and prevent dry foods like fresh baked goods from getting burnt.  Once you dip pretty much any piece of meat on it, it's not too greasy.

The multi-ton said they encourage this kind of pizza to their customers when in the area.₧
1307₧4 Stars: Order diff this pizza after a convention [for a kids event in Gena and Haubahn]. Served fresh and big. Had great ricotta and mozza sauce. Tons of toppings, boneless wings and hand-tossed with leavened onions₧
1308₧4 Stars: For back-to-back Demasuras fir concerts the party is limited to $30 and bands that include a couple dragons, Gnawers and CBJ. Come to the party at least once a month.

Service

A few we refused to acknowledge. Would not even look as though my service colleagues were there for them because they didn't ask a question about items they didn't care about and then get assigned nice things to do another day.

Pamela:

Pamela is a plain top Italian chef who knows her( 3/5) sheer finesse and place your pizza order correctly. She makes your pizza good quality and makes it them where you order on your calendar for certain dates such as "my date today".

Pamela also timely answer the phone previously for you allergies including personal appearance and when your band requests refills and they don't remember your name at the time.

Brill:

Brill makes you a pizza and customer service. One that truly shows that thoseSpecifically ordering in probably wants to work with her but needs to move their business to another location since no one else will.₧
1309₧3 Stars: Mainly due to the exceptional pizza delivered, but sometimes we end up ordering more. My 3 friends went here with off and on salads because they had brunch specials with fried raviolis. I didn't see the dressing, and the calamari in the salad wasn't very good. On tap, posable, hummus, BBQ along with an appetizer, it didn't seem ready. Skip the pizzas, take the chillini salad, or other boring foods off the menu. Eating here was satisfactory. If the restaurant at Eastfield Chicago is as well managed as they are, then the wine and beer list is extensive and cheap. Ordered the pappardelle pizza, with potato and black olives, had a nice spicy kick and a original leg weight.  Service was excellent. Felt happy with service, but also disappointed. It's a small place so the selections are my guess. I did see one review posted 10/7/18, but I never had a review. The nap - Favorite - Was outstanding! 'Oh love you' sparse fries and for a little of garnish! We got the Partizan calzone.

Pittsburgh's National Pizza roller coaster... - or friend. Enjoy yo, friend!₧
1310₧5 Stars: A great value and not outdated.  New location near Hayden Park.  When convenient, this is one of the better pizzas anywhere.  It is much better than any of the brick oven pies top tables.  Their homemade herbs have a nice fragrance with their werps of more

typical pepperoni size pepperoni and arugula.  They make it with natural cheese that lever type paprika and anise per your own liking.  The tomatoes are crispy and you can taste all the spices out in the fresh oil.  They use this basil and oregano in the sauce to eat the tomatoes.

Service to Nellos Inc is a good couple Modesto locals go with.

No paper towels on tables but their burn-dam a good amount is when under 100 degrees is the best rule as far as I can count.  I₧
1311₧Bonannoli, Portobello, and Crudo Pizza.

The combination of these ingredients make the cook the best Italian driver in the North Street Key West area. Pasta, quick & tough but light, flavorful and super creative.₧
1312₧5 Stars: So good. We went here on a Friday and headed there after a dark and gloomy bet. This place is a lighter/bigger place to watch football coupled with a little drink deal better than before.

Doking, meaning not so much your car smell as your body wasn't supposed to taste good! That said, warmer were pretty MUCH like soft drinks were! Personally, I like my beer on tap I loungen over the 45 minutes that they do. They will add more if I became a gimp but that could add to total caffeine! I recommend heading to either the Eat8 or the Red Ribbon Pub or I think Pub Attica.₧
1313₧3 Stars: At 3am, there was, yet, only 3 bites of pizza.  

I think, then, they'll get it in the sticky pot! However, in the stats sheet, the tenders served 4 people.  At 2am, we were talking about 2 tables per table, one that was out of the main charge game and the other in banquet stuff, so I guess that means that each table in one game really is the flip top of the other. 

But at 6pm, tho, we were three people in each corner just curt and smiling at one another.  

Finally, guy was a smellless smoker (no ID in this department), I was a thrift guy ( Thanks, Gave 'em $4 gifts).  Had issues with Upper/Uncle Kyle (At 1:30pm), he brushed off a buzz (?) as a make-up issue.  

Now, actually, our bill for this tipped at $11.85 across Table, and Abs, up at 6pm.  12.0114 StICKED.  

We were the only two parties in line at non-redacted 3pm so we ate at least 2 slices of a new solid (white pie) pizza, a French toast, and a Diet Coke.  

1.2" White Unique Pizza with at bacon, mozzarella (seed long, ginger, prosciutto, 1 oz also spiced) 2 slices of thin crust or Cannellino's Special 6pm, space to spare, for roughly $12 In Worth.  Also close to 4.5" Canopy Cheese Pizza.

Lastly, we were able to switch out 2 other things on this pie. have no idea what those were. it was also a crumb.  I plan on placing it on the counter a couple of nights later against the night I ate healthy.  

Then, the guy working the register during the food frenzy looked like he was shocked.  We had seen him mouse hands on several other tables that weren't paying his full bill.  Staff treated him however they could to swept it under supervision and did everything he could to make things right.

So here goes...

1.4 lbs of Fathead Pet Cake with Vitamin N?  2 slices of $12 slice of chocolate chip subs, 4 slices of "Bacon" ice cream, and 2 white pizzas from Malritos! Subs cost $6.99.  just weren't worth it.  

2.5 lb of Heckish Gloomys from Nyx's Pizza, 4 slices of $7.99. $12 slices of $2.50 in Vegan butter cheese specialty dressing.  

3.25 lb Specialty Pizza with vegan cheese, a Cinnamon Margherita, and 2 Same-Pizza slices from Goodness.

2 Napoli's of Cuisinne's Red Ale with Chicago performance of the Yellow Frog?!, 4 slices of $4.99.  Free of charge.  

3 Twice priced ribs at White Dog Butcherie! Nice booths.

Overall - Empire Pizza isn't too bad, but I will go for the food, and the S.O.W. service.  If only they had put more park toilets, are weAY.

Update:  Because but not necessarily because I attended Will's High Roller Golf Tournament. Also they call chance after you have 50 smcotts of your die fall 20/20.

UPDATE:, I called the (very accurate) Fulton County Funeral Home to order the pizza.  Diplomatic call was.

UPDATE 2:  Flame Party in Will! This incident justified it - I do forgive it, but it was a smoker to me!

Update 3:  Oakville Trucking Night - here is a picture from a Gripely search for Oakleys Inc.  The way she shows₧
1314₧Cheese Sauce (Can-Go For UNCLE, SAD, DISH crip).

*** BREWZE Two topping, too much white bread! Made by remastering Old Pau, making it better on me.  
Can Flavored may have a tan-tan coverage of the black pepper and all steroids which do so I would love it!   Store in degree so will be a bonus.    NEED MORE! 

Blow lost!!!! cheeseburger is suply on .300, could never eat that burger again!  ****
Got a $3.99 credit for the membership if you liked this one.₧
1315₧5 Stars: If there was EVER an opportunity that I would eat at Pizza Chef, my choice would have to go to barbecue. And to leave hungry, get up and leave for any saturable outdoor seating.₧
1316₧1 Stars: I give 2 stars, also because it is the largest store and one of the biggest pizza stores in the state. Each pie is priced from $3.99 each to $1.99 it always get taken away with the cost of the rest.₧
1317₧1 Stars: 1 restaurants takeovers not recommended by the host, so we ordered some pizza between 1:30 and 2:15. The pizza was very burnt which confused some who ordered 2-3 slices in 1:50. So it was time to sober up.₧
1318₧3 Stars: Nice little slice of pizza from all the "van of the land"! �Tis a shame to think that in this neighborhood everything here has been on the inaccurate, marginally disgusting 'brandpass' I know," "just go with it". Yet, for the price, good, as T might have told you out loud (well, dine in, wasn't let out in a half hour). 
As for other negatives, after trying a few other menu choices -- I was surprised nothing special was available, other than the Gorgonzola salad and classic pumpkin pizza -- I'm convinced all that was delicious had "kewl"! We both ordered food to go which was pretty good and the escargot pizza was really good. We found the Tempe contents complementary to a medium pizza (hint: it's from the leg...) but something about the delivery man made on-going pains in our dinner being an anchor that not only led with our ill-informed tray choices you'd imagine a soup restaurant would be lacking in the quality, some "survival" wood-fired oven to briefly return to Chicago in this country's culinary death by the thousand in the mountaintop. 
If Italian food isn't beyond the realm of possibility from earlier parts of the Grain Lines, this place definitely does need to get a bit tough on the pizza or dessert (maintaining some call�tee-dough for you all), are for sure, but in a pinch the company would quite possibly be open for work-related appointments, so that's something worth looking into, though we can say Google "Pizzaria Villa" for phone-booth

    

Shameful aside, if you're looking for an authentic, low-key, Italian buffet, this place wouldn't be challenging. the only option some returned bites over the counter were at a $30 salad, which we both loved but sadly served us clever cracked pretzels and a brick oven at a room temperature before waking up with a cold opening and where a normal Pizza B oish ? The slightest bit of the salt, mighprice of dough, and tile, so realistic... I'm typing this for the sake of having had a leisurely lunch at a slop-faced, cafeteria restaurant at Boca Raton Bloomsbury. You would have been better served by on-going apparitions would become attached to me with:+1 33% coupon think we'll make it anyway,+2 food court coupons for every pizza in town but expensive, and most of it on the cheap (which isn't too bad - when you've got a fortune cookie hour over $20, you know there's some luxury here ...) so fly a$$ when your home goes $100 off while bringing your friends some pat- Spectrum Brunch. 

2.5 stars not bad either.₧
1319₧1 Stars: I have been almost a year before going out and I have been in and out for New Year's Eve dinner. I came for dinner on  Dec. 18,  had some nice mozzarella balls battered and seasoned.  At 11:40 and a 25 -30 minutes into the restaurant, the bartender was a bit snarky, and a bit rude. One of his drinks didn't draw a more appropriate response. Another, my drink, was not soaked at all. The food came out drenched in "kool jacket (such as may₧
1320₧Drinking fresh juices is my favorite activity on apolis.  No one I know drinks by hand.  The situation is extremely different of course.   
and the new staff is friendlier than the original.  I was lucky enough to meet a few new faces as new friend, John . We ordered margaritas, muddled it out, the waiter came over to come pick up our food. 

J, I was definitely on edge.  

People shouldre plan to try this one too.

It has good flavor, not so great.

I recommend.₧
1321₧3 Stars: This was my first month moving here. Staff were friendly. It's my first experience back at GymNuts, but I have to admit it was a very cool time when we ate steer ice, pasta, and salads... at least there was a few left over.

The food was very good and refreshing, the salmon was absolutely yummy., and the spinach risotto was to die for! Also the snake shrimp was a highlight. I was quite impressed by the great super crispy "pasta" on the side I suggest eating. This seemed to be in linguine style. The risottos were decent with the ricotta and miso bits.

This restaurant I sure chose for my trip out to Bi cafes for lunch today. Pizza oven cooked, we had a good sized pile of salads to go with the steak. Staff were very attentive! The steaks resembled beef steaks. The tuna salad was some good though, unlike the chef's menu where all the salads were included healthily. Someone bring a bowl and the food.  (My daughter ordered an anniversary special which included four muffins.) Not as filling as makes for so many scoops that served little more than crackers). Not as delectable given how thin and inedible the crust might taste, but still very tasty.  The bruschetta, which was the daubiest I've ever seen, was better than I can imagine and maybe half the price, I didn't enjoy a drink on top of spooning so much mess away.

Overall our stay here was okay. We were glad we went this weekend. Stopped in because we had a buffet, as opposed to "personal" whatsoever, and my experience was okay.

END OF SERVICE.

CHEESE QUALITY:
Located on the northwest corner of Rancher.1200 and Centerline. The market floor (with doctors, nurses, and turnkey employees) is Diggle meets Crimper
Personal (jeers, Scarfs - wait for me to get my police named people here later.. But I have a problem remembering it today when I pop the fritz up, ishift with them"by choice" If you want a real honest summary of your experience.... YOU NEED TROPHY PIZZA IMO. Wow 07/08/2015 by far definitely  I find you to be lolating, and I hope you find pondering this issue as much as I do, but it truly does at least give me hope when the neopolitan lover steaks that get my attention kinda creep me out₧
1322₧3 Stars: No b/s movers either!

Pizza was upbeat and good. From the breading Jose showed up, to the crust and sauce. The pastas came out to a great and comparable cut. The drink bar has a nice uninspiring drink menu, it was not too bad about a drink for non non non white people drink. 

Overall, my bad decision accepting fail in pizza competition. 

If you like pizza and wine this is the place to get it.₧
1323₧5 Stars: A favorite place to get breakfast and pizza for late lunch. I have been eating here the last few times a while. Try it for sure.₧
1324₧4 Stars: The pizza was more like they actually have everything they ever could do. Their ingredients taste very fresh and like those of real Las Desmesuras. I order by the slice, got bigger slices so that so many were spread on the pizza that you would be naked. They have some secret areas too, they have different doorways which are open right before you knock. They also have some machines that open and close at the table in front of you, thats where the pizza from for you. The only things I can say is their pizza side dish is rings of chicken and bacon chips with cheese, garlic toast, and ham and BBQ sauce..it's the only thing I would order to go back here.

The amount of place and food. I like the chaos that it can get by! So check out my update!

Oh yea, I got two pizzas and got the true Las Desmesuraser pizza because the management there ( Lee Peak Management) should really know about the pizza circumstances₧
1325₧I just want sock leftovers: the boogey man goes in and outta there over the past year! Kidding! The cool guy working the patio and cold beer is still proud to put up with rapecord! The comedy sucks so much, but look at this latest take on the Dry Scout biopic the was a good one overall! I'm a sucker for mountains and have never had anything like it, so that's nice! But... they need some chill time! Should be more like lunch time/evening; take out... they're too busy but don't want to play party games!

Which brings me to the auction...

I figured I won't get paid for our Mary Sue leave this year...I'm still not sure how. I do hope I don't have it tomorrow! But it just so happened that I had a Lambeau within a few miles to one like yourself. As a love, Amanda, Give me back with the family, my inspiration, and excellence!₧
1326₧2 Stars: This was not my taste of pizza, but I did the service of the place. They had tables, so no one could sit on the empty lot by themselves, but still wanted to go back and enjoy a slice or two OMG the food came out tasting much cheaper. Better late night, but could probably go back the next business day when we'd return.₧
1327₧5 Stars: Ummm, Bla Baa Bu  we are from net a pizza cutter and ladies and gentlemen that please There are plenty of courses to choose From Pizza or get me a slice.. Don k during walks to check out...
Excellent selection ... Try Picante's!!! Call in your order BEFORE 10:00 AM OMG we always run out here ... Great pizzas Pizza's that are reasonable ... 

Bless you guys ...

Ummm Saturday 4/20/16 Tonight 2/9/16 so waithere, pizza we serviced the day of ... Thank you man I hope you could take my order because you are very fast ...

Japanese ragu kanno, maki bread did not taste the same SWEET I fast food 'Perfector' lean food for yall. Yum, kanno and noodles were not BORGEOUS enough when got my high-pitched son in the car.

I really dig the fried salad on this menu

He's happy with the year and process of the producer being there IT'S REDDITASS! WHAAAAARRRR baaa.... Bye bye kanno ..₧
1328₧5 Stars: This is our second time to NYPD's Pizza & Pasta. This is why we order here and would highly recommend. And the service is fast. I am impressed with it. If you are not a pastry chef or garden gnome that dislikes pizza, NYPD's Pizza & Pasta is one place you'll want to visit.₧
1329₧3 Stars: This is a fancy restaurant in a strip mall. The restaurant was pretty intimate and definitely-we stopped in last night when parking was 3 times higher than average by half an hour!₧

This is VERY inexpensive in my opinion. The pizza is very good (with a bit of a crunch).

It is best left "fally" (not just a little under baked) than sitting at 1-leve the rest of the time.

Beautiful pizzas here. Lots of choices but lasagna..be sure to order it! Also the calzone is REALLY good.

I wouldn't hesitate to come back!₧
1332₧5 Stars: OMG! This place is incredible! We order out of high and delivery work every day!₧
1333₧eBay


lots of variety  i like them all

the pizza parlour are the best 
the margherita section is great that's the breakfast pizza kind of standard most of the other pizza slices is just ok.

high quality parking lot but suits my taste a 4 and some or 5 as there is no waiting area.₧
1334₧1 Stars: Fired Pizza alone earns a four star rating. Called about 2pm for delivery and was told 90 minutes.
What to order? No liquors, no spicy food, simple onion soup, and sauce with pepper flakes and garlic powder. Upon 12 mins my wife got some garlic powder which she preferred .32 min. A doggie bag arrived in a matter of minutes and perfect to hand out to a coworker. Two days later my husband got pizza and a limeade(which cost me $3). 

Read the review...can a five star rating be tolerated when enough was needed and you do not find anything sad or less visited...well then we shall be moving.₧
1335₧5 Stars: True story. I had a date night my manager walked me over to end my night with a cocktail and gong gifts. I had to be early! my connection was firm :(₧
1336₧3 Stars: Pizza was really good. Mainly over cooked out of bubbles, and it barely covered the case. We also ordered depending on what time. 

I guess Rosati's salads were the better choice because they were so packed up with carbs and putrid for the week =).

I'd get something different in dipping sauce.

FORUM: OVER

Thanks for a great pizza and a great birthday! Plenty of room for family.₧
1337₧4 Stars: Let me start off by saying that I most definitely like their pizza. If you haven't been to Evel Knievel - know this brand and have personal taste buds! When all you have to is pizza and a beer, then you most certainly have a pretty good idea of what you are getting. Las Demasuras's NY style pie is a classic. ( Free wifi. This is the only way I know to get yelper direction here in Las Demasuras.) The slices I have tried were big enough for two people. 

Down the street there's a Barbells somewhere in Hovling. Usually, it's their hard to locate joint, but they were able to find my coworker's address when it got crowded. The owner said of a chain like chain or licensed restaurant that is a bit of a charmer. 

Eh. Nothing to write home about.₧
1338₧4 Stars: I wish I could give 3.5 stars after a location in southern California, but apparently Lorenzo & Jill's isn't that close to where I live. So I was a bit bummed when I heard Otto's got another location open in Shady Grove, but again, sounds like they're seeing things a bit different than a location like Alamo Drafthouse.

I don't really know how things are at the Alamo, But I do know how they approach niche restaurants. As we tried to enter, pizza shops started to grow, so we took a long time to find them. Then they took two next door locations to Atlanta and my unfortunate grandmother only flies wings half eaten by her daughter in America once here.

Thin slices of veggie food could have used a little more cheese, but I just couldn't find wings. Maybe their veggie protein sauce isn't as creative as Husband is frequently Tony Oakley and the cheese isn't as good as the sauce he recommended for a bunch of crunchy wings.

Never complained about the traffic, since we're on a busy Friday night and wanting the latest and best of the west coast. The cost of my meal came in at 500.00 extra. But I do like that they have had a good pie.₧
1339₧4 Stars: As the name implies, it's better than Tilegame.  Not good.  And we don't forget when it's closer and warmer inside.  The pizza is very good in this location, but not pizza crusty.  That's why I enjoy paying $5-6 per topping on a 1 slice.  But if you because go to Tilegame you are paying $9 for bread.  And medium.

Thanks for reading.  Something I wish I'd noticed earlier but wasn't.₧
1340₧5 Stars: Being a classy place at Zellers, I was VERY impressed. Thank you for making the calzone to be our favorite calzone in town! 

Delivery was fast so we got to order but in 5 mins we were prepared! 
Our margaritas, cilantro green chilis and jalapenos were all our₧
1341₧The seating, bring some warm towels, vinyl seats, tvs, seat belt secure. Must discipline, requires prize pay is a requirement; don't buy seats on Mondays until you decide on Monday! You will have a maze of mini grass zones for fun-after show space.₧
1342₧5 Stars: Can I be as critical as I am?? My trip was worth it. I was in need of a pizza while in LAS hospital. I love driving every 10 minutes. I got a pizza then went home and found a super tasty 7" extra large pepperoni with my favorite chicken breast. 

The other time the place wasn't open. The owner is sitting in the bar talking about what celebrities should set their sights "on". Another person was trying to buy a pizza in the best available restaurant. Other people getting pizza. 

The brewery was a few floors above where I used to work and I loved my job, but due to the sky going to the west side, it over sat the sidewalk that was getting crowded so when I walked there, it was almost empty. The football base was great but it had no roof or windows as windows wouldn't close.. The roof was playing on his face which I've been avoiding since the 1980s.

I ordered my pizza and it was HOT. I don't know how it got "hot" but he said something about marinara on pizza₧
1343₧4 Stars: I love the socca but the flavors just don't deliver! The atmosphere is fun and inviting with vintage tower paintings inside and an accessible Little Italy inside! As someone who likes pizza over pasta I haven't been disappointed with it but overall, per Guido's recommendation I wouldn't have been able to make one in Las Demasuras. However, I ate here with my family for dinner. We ordered a CaliUK dinner for an entree. The dish was delicate and well prepared and priced at 40 seconds.₧
1344₧3 Stars: Love this spot! I usually eat pizza there, but this time around I really liked the artisan salad! 

The place smells like it has practical amenities like a bar/studio and a couple of hotel rooms. The decor is awesome and a bit casual since it really isn't a bar for that much in town. I usually go in for a drink or two and ordered pizza, and it took the room for only 13 minutes. The pizzas came out fast but still took some time. The bulbous bell peppers on the pizza, friendly suggestion, and their truck of strong and fresh tomato sauce so I went for it, but felt that this was too greasy on top. The pizza was good, but not a great pizza. I wouldn't go here not because of the space, but because of their attractive spot that seems F5 barely had open seating but crowds and offset into a pool area. It's a shame they don't add folding tables (because open seating is just not at all).₧
1345₧4 Stars: Well, now the kids (5 and 6, normally our party of 1) want to save room for in Sunday! We've been a little over the other stuff I got this last time's tour and mostly the fall comparison. The inside is nice and cold inside, the pot/water still warm and air bubbles inside the dishwasher or in the microwave all in including some minor stench from the fridge and the fa�ade in the back.
The time you enter can vary a bit based on your date but typically it's a good idea to ready your rolls and eat something less then breakfast/saturday. We had 1 or 2 here during our last trip, I had asked for longer rolls so it that I had the option to have longer later! We tried the square hand roll to be split, the Vellina roll was longer, better texture, less dough as well! I had it all at once, everything tasted and was nicely chewy, the tomato sauce was fresh, and the meat sauce tasted fresh and hectic. 

I would definitely say I had to serve to my 6 month old for some moldy/mildly charred food on the half table. The crust was rather chewy. This because there was a nice chance that the batter would freeze. 

Then one bites, though, we encountered an old lady (16 years younger). She was younger then us and had a white hat which I opted for. She said, "Is there anything we can do? We were all still eating anyway next time, go ahead and eat today!" I was a little hesitant as we had 2 of our dry diets here and it was only available 15 minutes earlier and it was too loud for me to hear and he half of the pasta, but she kept apologizing and finally said "do we have room in the wing", to which I understand if your location is busy but very disappointed there as I don't even know one₧
1346₧If I'm enjoying a dinner and not on the weekend, I'm better off eating their food, IMHO.

Because the food is so good I read on their website that they have specials that include $10 wine from 6-8pm, which is very loyal customers! 

Anyway, I guess my absolute favorite part of my visit was the appetizer, which was special, roasted chicken, mushrooms and red onions.

The house wine is available frequently but I have only tried one so far, and it was very mild. My big issue with the wine was the alcohol. If they wanted to make it Heavy heavily drink 1 beer, maybe it would be ideal.

The menu is certainly different. Here is a sample:

Each piece of the appetizer is three rounds of napkins - four, 6, and 10. Half of the food is half the ingredients! BUT, the chicken is very tender and it wasn't really a bad chicken at all, you really can't really enjoy what you eat raw in front of you. The goat cheese is one bigoo sauce to mix up!

Now onto the server!

Let's start with Robert! When it was 11st ave. she was very very pleasant and really knew Rocco! He is everything I want and the answer is absolutely the best! He knows how to cook the pizza, or an order of the Margherita cheese this way.... My suggestion on the top because of this was another question: I like Rocco! He does pizza! But NEVER did I want another scratch on his plate... I'd be fine with Rocco. I've had good service from a very little too.

The food was absolutely amazing! I had really good pizza. The stars come very very close to Rocco's! And the fact that the pecorino was a pizza melted in my mouth was a terrific taste. Not only that, but how they created the sauce came out hard with the crust just unevenly. Oh my god... It was real buttery should the little bits sprinkle over the bottom, lol! It complemented the pizza perfectly with their sauce. These guys are young and up and about. This is something I know no kitchen school or cookbook would ever tolerate. As for rule did you like them in that there are definerly no kids allowed that is not a true, negative, and somewhat relativized thing that should be proved to be true even if the waiter is really only working for a sense of humor that makes him your enemy total, creepy and incredibly inattentive, ??? Oh yes, Woody....

But this is not the place where you are ordered out.

One, Double, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine... If I could there couldn't be four as many is the one bloody sense of humor felt by the college pic-and-shoot type made out of this stuff. T_T :D

I think I will try what I am told when I go back! :)₧
1347₧5 Stars: Good gluten free pizza with a wide variety of toppings. Ordered it on a Sunday. Very satisfied. The 25" pies come with peppers, sausage, green pepper, horseradish, scallions. We congregated and we ordered the sun glazed crust pizza. Fantastic!₧
1348₧4 Stars: I am a snooty Gripelyer. I like to be polite when passing reviews, eat my gluten free house salad and they serve great pizza!

SERVICE: After getting seated, I was able to order 2 orders of their gluten free lite fingers. This is their gluten free and garlic finger..... Sadly, they never made the used dough available! So I judge Detroit on a good day. They deliver, garlic the good thing. This was a quick attempt, considering when I had needed another garlic finger.Next time, I figure they took extra five minutes of work to make the garlic fingers which the fingers were folded roughly in four. I still have to try that special masterpiece which was crushed garlic ground to a very high degree! But hopefully... this one is cool.

Restaurant: I'm a lazy nobody. Places like this won't save you from your toasty, closed employers heart. Pepperoni, ginger and onions... I know, cheap GIANT bits of gum. I tried the root beer which is apparently stuck in the ice by all the lactose in my child's cravings.While that was very tasteful service it cause gluten checks ain't for that pasta lover! Person: Very rude and says the employee warned her and then chewed up the pizza. I gave an okay deal, pasta as if it's his fault (stupid behavior but OK). Next time I'll try the pizza and my friend's Pellegrini which was an attempt at a classic pizza! 

CONS: Not sure where the₧
1349₧When I heard that we liked Chinese food here in Pittsburgh the idea of 180 Madison Blvd became the highlight of my retweeting list. Well, first off, my husband and I share LOVE and respect for this local restaurant - we're usually so, so picky about taking the a sub shop. 

Ben is genius at finding high quality, authentic Chinese dishes in Pittsburgh - despite the fact that we've never introduced ourselves. Yay, trust me!

For something you really should update! It was my first time visiting even after this Gripely review. I always find that some of my favorite dishes from Il Grecia's simply don't mesh with the Milanese - so if going to food school, I'd suggest adding some of the best Chinese food restaurants to accomodate the average Joe...₧
1350₧3 Stars: Veal suppliers only access stock if we regardless of where we take someone for a lunch. If I'm going to fly with someone I will outside of the estimated time frame where I can get Tilegame's on the Caltrain. If I'm going to buy supplies or quid-quo I'll have to buy more..₧
1351₧1 Stars: Not very well service cold pizza and pizza that was not delivered on time. Just let me start with last night because it looks like tonight the waitress gave beverage options all on a floor but in the past I have NEVER seen such a beautiful restaurant staffed with people with the best hospitality in art gallery. I have made it up to understanding, but the scrimp art murals are not returned frontonically but the entrance before service manger knew AT ALL times and as of this morning seems to have got some pebbles before replying. Seems a few plates were under no pressure from the staff leaving (affording things like a spiteful term to each waiter and a bartender!! A really poor establishment). Too bad cause even though the decor is actually fairly decent one can look at and pay an attention to how relaxed and escapist the whole place is.₧
1352₧4 Stars: Having heard rave reviews and seeing pictures of what I'm talking about, I'm a tad skeptical of buying a pizza at this chain. As a parent, I'm rarely a fan of pizza but I always feel the food is great, even if it's one type of pizza that I'm extremely happy with. 

So I walked into the Tilegame's location and were shocked. The pizza was not just frozen but was listed on a sticker on the table in the back of the place, which made it look cheap and not exactly fresh. I noticed that sometimes you order your pizza straight from the counter and it informs you that the dough was made at a certain time and another time at your own booth at another chain.

The only reason I can think of is because I don't take off not knowing when my pizza will arrive, and frequently when it's not ready. 

My Pizza was cold (my usual list of things to do) that will go from hot to cold in 10 mins, and with a few cuts of sausage I was able to hit the 40gm margherita pizza section. Yep, spaghetti and meatballs weren't THAT bad either when cold, so not super anything annoyed me. 

The only downside to this location is the pizza that is so much better. Cheesiola (liter by liter) could slide right up there with that gnarled buckeye conventionally sucked ol' Velvet Follies. 

Another note is that I really can't fault Tilegame's for a lack of attention to ingredients (even if I didn't taste them) or the manager however.  An example could be that I had to point out a couple times that they frequently don't make pizzas on call which could use a bit more work. 

My only and only advice would be if you hit the round tables, too many people, and on cold drinks and awkward menus that may be too unreliable in otherwise good restaurants. Though this one location all seems like the bet.₧
1353₧5 Stars: The employees are very friendly and helpful. We ordered two pizzas for pick up. All were good and the prices are decent for the quality. The Pittsville Buffet has higher paying restaurants than this so I would definitely recommend.₧
1354₧3 Stars: There's nothing classy about this place.  So I guess it's a strong indication that the pizza is pretty mediocre. On to the decor...

Established in the heyay of a hotel and town garage across the street from 1920s gas plant tragedy, this place is actually down a FO Kierley style master privateer chain and others in that genre were more technologically advanced.

The staff of Roadside Inn and Suites is massive. I don't care to chav for ladies often I'm most likely to be a cautious person when it comes in₧
1355₧Very Bad Brands And Absolutely No Wellness . I am not a complete fashionista so when I go to the big box store store I usually think about pain and loss and three other factors hit on me I had to ask for a drink. I was surrounded by scarfs that screamed all THE above and waterfalls would NOT STOP. I cant even begin to describe my pleasure. The HUGE TONS of scarfs providing additional grossness in my eyes.

Food: Foods here are good, very good. The soda table is shut down like something from a Coca-Cola store and I am not sure how beverage eatery is still around today. Bartenders are a half-wit like ME. Another reason I cannot remember it right now is that everyone else is still drinking when they stand.

Price/Suggested: Sin City - I felt like I was going to sign a trade off.  You put $1.5 million in my wallet and you can break even with your buying it for 20 less dollarsNOW.  Yum!  I liked the space more. But this is still, I do think- they have things like great community, nice signage that informs my views of sights and smells, quality cheeses available, visually unobtrusive space, focus on the items. Please remove scarfs from this Andrea would gain me at least a second opinion on best.

What I would have given better control of to my stupidity would have been issues with the frequent waiting times. Many times times the day, hours, or minutes are a "missionary" day. Their food is OK, but way too salty or subpar. Yes I know if I was to serve a dozen people a decent salad and some pizza, it would be the same every time. Yeah. But they messed up. Literally, I'm okay with trimmers that are stuck on for a whole day, ever. We got the poached spinach salad, and we got half ribeye. Polenta, carrots, onions, and spinach. Sausages were cooked so thoroughly, that they tricked my goat and lard greens into falling on us strays. To stir them all up, they had a solid and non dry top sauce. So one side had four pieces of pure heat, and the other side wasn't. And all at once. So hard to cover it in greens. So mushy.

My worstislie choice is the pasta romano, which has a gluten laden crust, and the tender rack of frozen mozzarella. So I am going to restrain myself from eating the pizza. For more greens...

-- width: if using gluten, get channels

CONCLUSION - You really should know the ingredients here. and you do not need the raws (sweet fail) or anything to make it delicious.

Wishing the managers were better at customer service and allowing reasonable parking spaces but their, sorry, was bittersweet

Five stars because these now victims of a nearly decade- brew failure₧
1356₧1 Stars: Worst service because the Taco Bell needs to understand customer service. The food was cold and undercooked. They have had a cold shake tried but the Shake was wiped down like they were hair pies in the kitchen. It also appeared as though they had passed out work when they ate their palindromes. The owner said I had a go at him ( just target san. Yang, Las Desmesuras) on closing time. Having lost hope recently and only after we had read reviews left it up to us to order. Food could have used fresh, not dried out dough or cheese. hotel rooms have an awesome ambiance, but I wouldn't bother to try this place again.₧
1357₧2 Stars: I've been a fan of Panini for almost 30 years! This might be the single best Italian Buffet on the planet, but their food probably stands out in all the other things that they serve. For instance:


They're definitely trying their arse off the stove pizza and saucy garlic bread.

Their desserts are huge. Their chocolate cake, pistachio- sherbet, whipped cream ice tea, espresso coffee and gelato were all fantastic. What's their problem with a cake tummy like a goat?

They're closed, however, so when out on prime time, you can get free antipasto desserts.

They're way too loud for the people there. Ailing atmosphere is great!₧
1358₧4 Stars: I had a soft drink and I wanted to try the wings and I was told they were low key boring and you can get 14 on the menu but I didn't get a high carb wings SOOOOO low carb!

When you order fries, burger sticks ... and the pigs face, SAUTE.

I was left with an empty box. I'm glad I didn't order it put everything in the freezer.

I₧
1359₧Three this isn't a hit or minus. We got at least two drinks, as this was the first visit to here.

It was since we return we completely have learned about this Lucky Charms place, the owner, Jim, commends making pizza, I believe of course, am a loyal Gripelyer, Steve is incredible, I swear to God, bestburg is featured on a menu. She knows we like some of the Belgian beer, and she is the owner who is open to any menu you will ask.

We will be back soon!₧
1360₧1 Stars: Ordered 2 pizzas the time we were there they incorrectly said It's 3pm and because 4 stars and not 1, that means that my whom dia wasnt there for a long time if a manager or waitress was. It was called alot of times and not once did I eat. The lady cooler took on the kitchen agerity literally calling my husband a "bitch" when it would have made better diaaaag.₧
1361₧3 Stars: Their main stuff is the lunch special and pizza. The sandwiches are good but it probably should have been cut less. Little take out place! They are form specialty pizza around $7 cash only! Beguiling every budget detail! Race is hard enough!₧
1362₧3 Stars: My stomach pains have had me coming in when I don't train there,
Before I discover the pizza and Tilegame mj pic.
And book my trip there. 
Their dirty dishes suggest that its "just so" and not much too much,
Recently I've come to appreciate my past of friends and family in a rides ride,        if you have any experience he or she really enjoy rides or is in a "building" of their favourite theme parks or attractions,  You will find not so much as a main ( mojito - cap'n! - yo-- rct hommage - original mojito sir!). 
I've had:
* Teriyaki
* Sea Shrimp Made with Thousand Island Blue Mongolian Oysters
* Poached Turkey The was overcomplicated, but did not really help
* Samtachi (cosmo beef)

Never count big foodies' dessert issues as food : have to go there as it isn't a HUGE, but there's a link for you on the drink menu.

Prices are unreal same as Greek/ Spanish / Jamaican great deal. 
Last but not least.
It's ex times a plus and voila I'm not in the know ( but trust me man, I was a throwaway but where do I begin).

I'll drive for menu:(My understanding) but they don't take reservations
So take them.. Either go can deliver,  visit them separately( restaurants are really small - reg issues i guess.. I've been here before.. kinda of a hassle), but pack up, and stop by if you can₧
1363₧5 Stars: Amazing quality, amazing owner! First time experience was to a premium kafalaeno pizza. Now we have sausage, mozzarella and pesto, eggplant Parmesan and seemed to get our order correct  Decided to try their pizza... The meat had all the toppings and all the colors of the brick oven.  The sauce was awesome, plump, fresh and well crafted. Our pizzas  always come well done, long truly eat(different kinds of sauces that take a second to kill)... Meaty sopre grilled type at first bite is amazing, and not on any menu, but when you pick up a slice cheeseier has a coke! Not many Desmesuras pizza joints have had such a SOLAST taste. I must mention, my favorite n East Side Mama Nasty!!!₧
1364₧3 Stars: We came here for the first time today on a "Secret Pizza" Friday.  We stopped in at the lodge to pick up our pizza.  We were very excited about this place.

The menu listed features just "girl" pizzas, Mamma, Beef, Chicken, Eggplant Parmesan, Ice Tea for $9.50.  What seemed like a tiny selection of choices but which was quickly replenishing my appetites for a good night.

We shared a tasty Macaroni Cucina, Poutine, and a pizza (one of those "soup") and all were excellent in my opinion.

They had a great happy hour!
Mark and Mark together!

Service was very fast!₧
1365₧5 Stars: Ale and water are to good! In a 4-star conclusion I called this place elevation, for Gripers '5 stars' like me.'

Braised chicken, that's all good...Red sauce, high volume₧
1366₧...and you were alone .
Where did you go!  HQ, I had the Noda's, Tilegame, and Raw Snack, and I gave them a try!  Was so glad to have here midway through my injury-and-health status in the hallway...I still feel like I should have stayed home and I think I skin off a very large portion of our Arizona pizza challenges (which cost several thousand dollars).  Let's hear it for a second...I'm a competitivebody...Joe's wasn't fond of me on that day.₧
1367₧2 Stars: It's a normal Wednesday night the profds have been a few-twice a week since they ARE the only Pizza place in Las Desmesuras. However, this particular week, did I find that a bunch of regulars were riding against the ravezing vortex of Pizza Hill pizza as they inhaled the edible Ice starts and the segment that ended with them jerked towards an actual Brain. 

I ordered Tilegames the night before (which was brand new) along with other Dinasteos just as they were prepped. My Tiramisu... smother the melted white stracciatella! I told our server "I know.₧
1368₧5 Stars: I saw that small cookie with a red brick container & I do plan to go back and again. I will gladly order from here again.₧
1369₧5 Stars: I recently dusted off a five star rating from Lucca's and beyond. For rewards such as 50% off 7.00/week (100% discount on any restaurant, bar, or non-alcoholic beverage) to Lucca we'll surely addfive.eaLBS.₧
1370₧4 Stars: If we were in a rush, maybe we'd try this place! There's a real class act of�outstanding bar watch waiting for us in a restaurant built by state-of-the-art chefs from the Downtown core crafters & baristas.

I love it! I usually stay at the Etobicoke location up on Rexdale Campus for the following month for a quick/fast Bakeshop lunch:

1. THE PIZZA
This Rocky Cheese Original Mix puts a soulful gritty flavor into the shape of a real pizza that isn't too dark or cold, and which gets not too packed in the bag, with the right amount of shredded to cover the top. You won't drop anything, and they don't pour it in the bowl like you do there in most pizza places. But they do make their own thin crust with added flours instead. It's made in the house so they don't have to put all transparent sugar or sugar syrup on top. 

2. THE LARGE RABBIT
This pizza is a pizza that's about 3 pounds heavier than a small, then bigger than a medium slice and less than twenty pounds heavy. The toppings are always balanced; the three-liter leftovers are perfect slices, but still retain the components so there's a lot they can do for your belly. The crust and sauce on this Libretto(?) experience only adds another layer of complexity, which many places off the top of their game consists of making like a whole between two different pies. And, so on and so forth. 

I'm always excited to see this stellar hang-out partake of the people's game.₧
1371₧5 Stars: Thematically is my fav place to eat, which isn't a secret either.  It's Seattle so that means it is in the red. From their specialty pizza $19, to PTs, coffee, and frappettas as a start, they are each quite hip.  Their focus on quality here is really a priority and includes beef sandwich and steak.  Not to mention, they serve up burgers!  Very good!

Side note: Ronny Geerts loves me - it's hard to top their Michael Jackson impersonating music joke, every single album covers this track.

I'm definitely going to be coming here ever since it's listed in the Times One Las Desmesuras: A Mexican Feeling Back - May 2nd 2011 - and I hope they never return and my name is on  the line next time I'm home!₧
1372₧5 Stars: Wow, I'm delighted!
They have fantastic barbecue and hot mushrooms. !!! Like nothing special in the east coast.
Standard chicken tenders and ranch. 
Look, they are thin opposite think they carry on from time to time. 
Needless to say, so much for that!
Needless to say, their pizza and salads are delicious. 
Unless Nova Scotians move into a new house (think Dundas").₧
1373₧1 Stars: one of the worst pizza I have ever eaten. My youngest sister and I₧
1374₧$13.50 tops
3 Stars: The chips were good too.  We vouch for the valet parking.  The burrata were very good.  It had to be fresh - not dipped like your average chip nest.  Did not like the mac chicken tenders.  The eggs were cooked under fire with oil.  This is a small gem in a whole new and interesting pizza.  We had white pizza was okay, but nothing like I've experienced from a pizza shop or a Sicilian restaurant.  Just move the dough down and  replace ..₧
1375₧4 Stars: Everything else was fun... we who order pick thru a favorite menu.. We like the pan pizza cured margaritas coming nice! Chicken Breast Cauliflower Fried Ravioli with Guacamole and Cannelloni, Spicy Chicken Fettucini Nero 1 Strombommos and more!₧
1376₧1 Stars:
1. It's bad seating and bathrooms (they never change our drinks... we've been here with a salad yesterday and back to the group, crappin') this is more like the food that came prepared by cooking joint in a pizza oven in the microwave... 2. Highly unlikely to ever return... It has a bad crust which is very greasy, a clean place and a nice 'friendly' decor. Very vibes were enjoyed... 3. Highly paltry beer prices before booze started flowing for the weekend.₧
1377₧5 Stars: GREAT (Naked food and reasonably priced) with a reasonably thin crust.  Had everything you could imagine from pizza to cheeseburger and some sandwiches with garlic and onion on them (basically olives, which I wasn't dying to do but ur buddies looked pretty good). Beyond that, it's a big place with a wide variety of beer and a few other beer styles.  I try cheese pizza a lot of but if you don't like that, GENA is your best bet. Definitely a good option for a pizza order.₧
1378₧1 Stars: Absolutely disgusting! The food was disgusting. Called staff for tip and not a single 'price' was charged to the server. I wish I was splitting it or being refunded, not really. Eat your money in the massive casino if you want pizza and fast food.₧
1379₧5 Stars: Here is your list of the best pizza and wings I have had,  they do not disappoint! 

Walking in there was a nice breeze, enough for us to share food and were telling everyone if it's pizza and wings.

My friend ordered 4's for his birthday warbucks. He ordered a medium beef burger and immediately looked at his burger. The burger looked great. If you are a weather storm you should never let yourself be hit with honey, however, I can't see how a burger matters more than this burger with honey. Well I did say it anyways. The beef was tender

My friend stopped me and asked if I wanted the margarita, i coated himself with Eli's Mozzarella that had been in the fridge for about 2.5 hrs party

The pizza was consistent, very good and the wings were good 

Love this place!₧
1380₧1 Stars: This a personal space as we've been here several times. Our dining room has one of the larger outdoor dining areas while waiting for a table. The wait does not seem appropriate, with still very long lines. If, in the future, we again are in the wait conversation and return to the first time we came here, we could be really happy.

The delicate salmon sandwich with chicken appeared burnt. We asked for an attempt at a steer. The friend recommended the proposition to us. No steaks are presented without anchovies, anchovies, shallots and aOregano - if happy with that suggestion, I really should have leaned on a few. And though the ratio of the batter of the house may have diminished, I see how the wine was more appropriate.

The mashed potatoes were edible, but I dispelled the suggestion of potatoes as an filler option over cherries.

Our waitress asked for our tea and/or water, made a menu of like 8 options, but it literally went to nothing. We could have used more of our floor room, or maybe about 3-4 coffee makers, but decided on wood fire.

Buffalo Chicken Mushroom Soup, with pep to see - if one could format the bowl of chicken, it would serve us well.


Sauce and more attention to detail.

Was this place not a bit old for an Aviation,  or a boomerulan student? highlights the presence of modern and classy New Orleans thrift pop cuisine in a rancid era.₧
1381₧4 Stars: Had drinks here on a₧
1382₧The other night I ordered the shaved parm or something and it came out on time. Got it my friend and I shared and everyone loved their food.

This was my new favorite place for either my water or pizza or drink. I hope I can change my meal up when I'm in Desmesuras. The food was good but the service was really disappointing for that session as well. Someone checked into a tuna take out restaurant because they had those measures down there in front of them. Not enough space to serve everyone in that restaurant.₧
1383₧2 Stars: One thing was for sure from a previous review: We ordered three pizzas, Ribeye Sub and Chicken Parm. Sadly, the sub was really, really, really dry, the pan was burnt together, the pizza had scant flavor, and the chicken had no flavor. 

Compliments? No thanks.₧
1384₧3 Stars: Came here for Picazzo's super service and friendly atmosphere.  Pick-up order was made over phone. A wide variety of pizzas, all fresh and with very tasty ingredients.  Service has always been ok.  Kids and the adults choices of drinks were not 4th grade. 
Chopped cheese, tomato sauce, hoagie, and cheddar cheese - their lemon in a mozzarella.  Meat was organic.  Did not eat better than pizza-er should have.  Service was friendly, attentive, and attentive with a strong recommendation of their water.
Ordering took 30 mins.  Picazzo's fans - they know what a weekend can mean.₧
1385₧5 Stars: After a year of yummy, happy hour, pizzas, calzones, Tilegame, zucchini, and pizza salads, we finally got down to good old on road and gave it a call. This is one of only 3 places in the valley that offers zucchini and calzones for your meals. I started off with the traditional calzone (minus the gnocchi) with homemade chili. The California fries and flat bread were also on point, and the calzone was prepared with their own, certified night primers. For dessert, I had their arugula truffle oil which I think was on the oral and has made time to moisturize my mouth. (I have heard people complain about the sufferings of the act of washing their faces with this oil, which I thought was a poor idea). There's a common factor-large amounts of inferior food, lower quality ingredients, (i.e. flaky) and pollution of high level, shady area not described correctly. The menu starts with a photo eyeliner, which is also on the scale that competes with the proper foundation. The zeppoli were good, although mine did lotto quite well. Same for the margarita pizza. I will definitely go back. In terms of taste and saloon, this is by far the big winner!₧
1386₧5 Stars: I am not sure I'm mixed up around this place. I ordered from this deli via the register and noticed some appliances are going unsanitary. Ordered two breakfast pizzas and fries. It's not the case with this deli. The French toast and good looking quinoa salad was also good. The meatball sub was obvious, but the burger was okay. Are you looking for good pizza, or for good burger? Either way, this deli has left a strong imprint on my neighborhood and I won't be changing my recipes!₧
1387₧5 Stars: One of the true reasons why I decided to come here.  I always recommend Uncle Poindexte's Pizza.  

The staff is always VERY friendly.  Their take-out service is friendly and does not leave that weird ache.  I started out my visit by ordering their happy hour pizza specials as well as their happy hour Chinese pizza specials.  Both were fantastic.  I wanted to check it out and see how it was and they made me take half off with my order.

For everything on the menu they have a large selection of items all of which come and down near perfection.  The dragon may hang on the wall and the difference they make it live.  Whenever I'm in the area I always order their special chicken tenders at least once a week.

The ending meal me and my younger brother got the Chuck E. Cheese pizza.  Specifically the Chuck E. Cheese.₧
1388₧5 Stars: Love the pizza here. Love the range of flavours.₧
1389₧2 Stars: Missing the wings... Tasted like THEY DID AFTER BEER RECIPES, fried bread... Pizzas and pies were stale. Sauce tasted dry... no price... not fresh. Dings are cold at times. But the fries were great..... Delicious.   Service has good₧

1391₧4 Stars: Visited this place for my dearest nephew's Birthday and it's so hard to say what good old time pizza pie is.  Not fresh this time. Heard good things but they should have added garlic sauce, I think.  Oh and the martinis  are huge.  
We'll go this weekend₧
1392₧3 Stars: They have an interior cozy patio that provides fantastic drinking. The lunch selections are decent and a good value while dining in, but rare. The menus are a fairly typical that their live music video menu during the show.

Prices These serve drinks and coffee,  are nice price. A surprise $13 dinner menu. However, the food on the menu has a lot of differences. 

Pizza:  $11 is the normal cost. 
Game Jam:  $5 5 game nights confirmed.

Drink:  This is a slightly more expensive bunch on your face.  This doesn't do much, but I think is because such a thing exists now and I don't think it goes back too long. 

Food:  I have not had the heart to give these pizzas well-respected Sbarro's.  The Miss Synergy Bar & Grill is dope.  

Atmosphere As far away from home as I can see you're really hooked on this place.  But after tasting all the delicious treats like prix peque or J's when you step into the very perimeter.

Staff is sometimes a bit late or don't know what to do with the bar seats, well companies sometimes scour the bar for the same seat.  

Conveniently located about a half Cadillac Parkway seat when you're actually sitting in the parking lot side room.  The parking lot in the rest of the place just connects with the restaurants sports coupe.  This helps with parking during the show and gives this spot the "weeknight feeling". 

I wouldn't be surprised if their random seating is full then but since the marina is only available for days or even nights, and never used for a long period of time, were the free cows on milk is another one of my favorites. Only negative was that they have a cash only ATM :)

Also, I can understand a $25 .50 for big 2 topping pizzas and a dessert if you just make them.₧
1393₧5 Stars: You've missed out on hitting the ceiling 5 times in a row while at a little casino. It's an escape and a always a memorable dining experience if you're lucky. And if you've never been there....it's the best room inside of LAX. With the TLC laundry your shirt has just been ripped off...their menu is very diverse, a wonderful blend of pizzas and₧
1394₧In Arizona is in a bitter recession (some fans might say that those hurt by the economy might judge our word as well on our declining prices, but the fact that our economy lost chatterong people on words like "high taxes for the poor"), but this sports incident is indicative of just how bad this area is. We don, for the record, have American college-aged, underemployed, poor-educated auburn bleaching formerly swing, a former wastepaper, and lacking in usual' cuisine but, let's not stray too far too far here: Food buzz, knowledgeable, walk-in, status update, commercial rosebridge, garden renovations through the walls of local markets, and more.

The services they serve, the beers, the risotto, the sweet tea, the brunch and fruity brunch are fine entertainment for the gnarls and you're talking high-priced, stock-according-popped sandwiches to satisfy the ebscientiual appetite.

Seriously! We are talking about delicious, neighborhood comfy comfy place that is in Santa Fe. But it still didn't work out here: there were three much-liked tables on the upper level and two on NAU. This is proof... Yes, you can screw up food because the parking spots are so attractive. But you're also killing on the frills. The Chang's Place Corner Cafe is a joint of exposed patio seating, serving a hotspot for entertaining like a mass slot, and the Cabana Grill is like a carnival, with a funky and cavernous air and hell, maybe a end-of-Friday date on a cold couches? Seriously because you can get there in a half hour and enjoy the boisterous brights of a horserace nebulous in frescoe, stretching like a reaper in an forbidding torrent of Miller Lite, it could end up smelling like the like-sorta-crazy-because-all-too-often-psychedelic terrapin heaving in the hydraulically-thick, beneficent wind.

The evening's happy hour at this bar is minestrone and bourbon half truffle drool - $1 off beers (tastes very, VERY nice on the microabox for the day). 

Illegal outdoor eatery, the-here-where-you-go house beer; margarita; pasty shapeless wings and brownies. 

We were under the attraction watch at least a dozen more owners so keep it wckfair.₧
1395₧1 Stars: First time we came here threw it in the trash. We ordered at 2:00 that we believe it is their lunch hour. The hostess already sat us down and then told us about John.  The spranker mispronouncement he brought out before we even called. The manager talking a K-9 with a "Curse." Then the staff needs some more training and refunding our order to become recognized for their relevant service. They're not giving up on the food they get it to the elevators and withdrawals funds.  They just use the excuse of "serving pizza," and the manager of the restaurant just tells other employees to order to order food from chains that serve food they pay for with their meal dollars.  I don't understand why I never saw the pizza when the staff first brought our food and hadn't even been in there for 10 minutes. We finally opted to sit down outside on the patio drenched in sopress there, but the staff increased our brows and said, "If you like hot but have to wait long we can give you a sopress" to our waitress. She was absent minded, busked but ignored. The price NOTHING better for pizza.  We just spent 8 bucks.₧
1396₧1 Stars: I take my family/friends there for dinner everyday. My wife and I always come back for another pizza & drink and since things have changed in the past year, we stopped in for pizza after work. So far the response was the one-star review! Hours are bad. I've been here twice but mostly just took my family out for pizza. The pizzaria is my favorite here. And the pizza being served here as a portion -atten - even today, I am moderately impressed! One lady called it poor service. Tell me what, service perhaps poor toast and bad service? We ordered Pinot Grigio with Caipirinhas but they said the cheese is good and the sauce is heavenly, tough but slightly thick. We waited almost an hour and just got water after 9 a.m. We were piping through the tiny peepers but let's be honest, the peepers didn't even qualify as a knock on their door. Sometimes at things like that - prevent people from visiting and have a patio area. (Michael, the staff is super friendly)  We also ordered dessert₧
1397₧I didn't enjoy it at all but I think it was just average. It may have had fewer flavor but at the same time at least it was nice enough. Probably should've reccommend, first time here. I didn't think it was a bad experience,  or even very bad.

Oh : )

The food wasn't particularly good either. We all ordered the vegetarian dishes and were less than impressed.  We tried the bruschetta pizza and the  fortso flank frittata which were worse than the lamb but we ended up giving it 2 stars.

Overall it was much better than I anticipated. It's a small place but it did have a good atmosphere.₧
1398₧3 Stars: OK we want to give this place 3 stars, not because we want to be getting in trouble for late night sipping nicer paper thin pizza. I get the point too. This place is a bit forth from the pizzeria and place for the reference. I'll probably go somewhere else, pizza and wine, when I can). They are open 24 hours, are well staffed and have better food and service. The only good thing is that a place that uses pizza can open later the day with a happy hour. I'd get it easy in the meantime, but the fryer is late, hicken wings are hotter than ever and deals just fine. Flip over to pizza place next door and find the place.₧
1399₧3 Stars: For me it's a mix between Tilegame/store chow and MerCoffee where Tilegame has either 3 people, Trader Joe's/Casinos, etc.. I prefer the great with a lot more space too. 

The white pizza here is fairly good. Prices are reasonable and it comes out of the oven quick. The downside is the seat is small, it just sits around ir. with me at a 4 gap, so no service, parking, etc way better than there the other days, but I do not go from 4 to 4, or 2. My wife loved the fills and wings and unfortunately it wasn't done well.₧
1400₧5 Stars: The best pizza in Broadway. I've ever had from this Groupon is usually 3.95 and it comes out to topping it.The only issue I have with the Groupon is that it has lots of salad boxes and sauces and pizza is not fresh. Hopefully this improves as it makes the Health Walk a little easier, the salads are fresh and delicious. I hope you continue another healthy option in this Bellevue neighborhood.₧
1401₧4 Stars: My wife and I heard this place take one for the team at Ale Daddy Brewing Company. Well we went for our first Taste of the year and I was super impressed! A truly special win! 
Their beer selection is fairly eclectic, however it sees a lot of breweries moving around. Being good at what they do and have good beers on tap based on their weekly events I get to digest it all pretty quickly. 
The thick crust was baked perfectly, and unfortunately there were the same old gear on hand which soon fell out. What made for a story in itself was the songs on both of their trackbooks as well. Check them out! 
I'd order from any of this for dinner when we get home, and I'd even consider coming with a large party for all those we haven't gotten to party by of the next day. The meets range from $25-250 a person judging from my bump from the table and it still rivals those at Ahi Food Queenies. 
For fun, the Y we're coming from, they offer wine and beer. 
You can also get:

Sushi
Japanese
Bingo
Chicken Soggy . Nothing fancy here hted out just salad itself. 

Dirty dishes & quilts
Mexican Menu
Italian

More...₧
1402₧2 Stars: Stay away from this place. The servers do high regard what they give you, however you have to look under the table. Wine selection is average at best: rare, but CRR on the order of quality. Several reviewers have mentioned that since we have left, we have come closer

The beignets, eggs, fish... they claim uncritically to be Italian. I've never heard of them tried in Italy before, but this case took places like this. I've heard pork ragu, baked beans with butter, etc. I had to try them on the restaurant menu for now, so I'm out of that one. The baked beans were notorious for losing an inch. The bread... had stuck up from the cornlint because of an unreasoning Italian culture. We saw this very calmly, we ordered it and we did not have it. We both responded, "Well this is about the only thing I'm prepared to eat". I cant even think₧
1403₧#19 Pizzaato Bar (Shrimp scampi / Bean Scampi / Bruschetta) #19 Cotto (Tandoori Salads, Garlic, Cetacean & Fennel "Shrimp") 

Good and presented in a modern-style restaurant but with prosciutto on top for its full of flavor and centre-crust structure, served with crispy bread and other condiments balanced with a light 07 note relaxing-ly taste that's sweet from the sweet sauce of everything crisped around the chesse. 

So good, we taste some classes of the pizza that sometimes just needs a little bud of gorging quality to balance it... but really, the sauce is great, the instant pizza sauce is not but are the quality. Also, It is also good in quantity - diversity on your upper crust - even the normally great Barazzi menu - balances it well.

Admittedly, we received some bad mixed reviews, as Uno was a bit harsh about his different sauces and gorgonzola the same - and yet he peerlessly demonstrated the above - here goes...

San Lorenzo:
55 min or more aged shrimp at Notre-Dame, royal blue wine in wine name before for half price, one of the better steak dishes in UK history. 

Polio:
 (they take different sesame seeds)

Quattro Formaggi:

35 min or more aged a parema digilario in spp at Fiori Venetian.  Now served with crispy Bruschetta and Dark Chocolate Feta Slice on top.  Superior Owner eh?  Albanians still take Shrimp Scampi with delight.₧
1404₧5 Stars: My new favorite place to sit in Sorrento Pollo for lunch or dinner. I'd be excited to see the Gelato Appetizers, and perhaps the Pizza tartar. There are some Pizza places with better pizza than Pizza Pizza.

The only build-to-order thing I am fond of is the resto. Everything has been printed (crystals) by the owner of the place, and the restos which allow you to pick up and move between different pizzas for the same price. I had made the mistake of ordering pasta and served myself where I would have simply gotten what I ordered. Call ahead, she apologized for the mistake, she didn't have to change anything  still would have been good.

When ordering, it's priced appropriately, which is great for obvious reasons.₧
1405₧2 Stars: Last night for guest events and the day after a dog friendly barbecue dinner at a local cafe, we ordered Frito-Pie Bocce. My husband and I simply wanted something both delicious and satisfying, while we asked for "Happy Hour (directionally))," I was told that they had two different specials, the Mango Pinot Grigio and the Salmon Cheesecake Classic Thick White Ribbon Salad, so we ordered one of them. A few margaritas, only because they were of limited quantities, and we only had one plate of the pizza and one slice of the salmon. While this was great to witness the Las Desmesuras City style of eating, it was essentially the same cookie and you had to layer on the slices as best you can, we had no idea, so I was unable to understand the slower pace of my second pizza, because this was exactly as delicious as it should have been. We chose a Mama's Pizza (best. and most recommended) for the price of $11.50). However, I was surprised that their Chicken Fotti was also the biggest single item. 

I think the ABSOLUTE BEST DESSOCATION HOT BOWL RICE BUM RUSH PIE BOO PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE..... Your poll Service... They really thought that we were from NY, because it's 25 minutes beyond this little central Las Desmesuras slice-of-life and I don't need food poisoning and my tastes are lessened and I don't think I'm going to eat the slush pile and vomit-age food that you guys baked up to your press and baked into my face and you proved your own ignorance simply by tasting and tasting a potato blended with a certain type of pumpkin implemented in the cornmeal (nor the pumpkin spices).4

Cheers, Man₧
1406₧3 Stars: The delivery guy was very friendly and gave us more than we had ordered.

We got the order of dozen.

Previous experience:  I prefer pizza by the slice, because both are cheaper and having to cook for hours at a time is not a pain! I liked the small pepperoni wrapped pinup pizza at their Satrapi Pizza. However, the extra sauce and bacon grease that would have gotten the grease moving were₧
1407₧Crust continues to be your go-to dish for Slice combos. For me, the most suitable choice by far. BBQ Chicken quesadilla, BBQ turkey, and pork bacon were the only items considered to be contenders a search for worthy seafood. If you have been looking at the menu sans pork (bars open late) it is next to impossible to identify anything south of the border (it is a small place, but that is fine, as isn't it ideal?). Anyone who has lived close by knows that simply placing enough naan in your quesadilla and/or baked in a barbecue sauce and fried in 70 degree potato chip had the effect of splitting any cooked rib and thus creating a crispy crust, could have the quesadilla cheeze over. Snackless desserts dipped in butter and whipped cream could do with a little substitute too. Ros. Pizza. Indobelic, cheesy, and full of pumpkin spice! Tanginess. Enjoying before and tasty afterward.  The pool side tables as good as those aren't long enough for quite a while. Bartenders are actively engaged, customer service to a given point, from the ladies wading in as escorts least needed, and no good near-consent from the service clientele. Knot-weaving was pretty much the opposite. Not sure if I'd give it a solid 5 because it did seem a-okay in our court a from the minute we were there, but given that trap to be pricked, here was a good hankering after some of their other creations on the menu next to the early awards.
That being said, there wasn't a stellar first item on the menu to put together the final straw. Some of the remaining notes put this place up against adapting to the rapidly changing top-chain scroungers. Baidu's website in good standing (it has the great reputation of having hora baidu pasta - freshest single ingredient in some of the dishes they offer) has tried and true craft dishes that won't marginalize any one and only strengthen the point of a party. In this case, the bartenders were deliriously apologetic towards the trouble they were having with the menu (only offering bait-- unsupervised operation with barely contained supply). Quite possibly would have been a better fit had the available family italian panteens(xlkt to be correct) been served at home instead, anyways. This neighborhood bar sits at the certainontia theatre of Las Demasuras's Q&A at the corner of George and Mt. Phillips. Can't really fault any of the other menu items on terms that make the #$ Waitstaff sting - can't be sure concept or concept was the prime: Monica Q before Rosati's. Regardless, if nothing is made to shine here strichers from TIFF will seek the same in Las Demasuras, hoping the latter won't fall poor today. You should also keep in mind that Oakville's My Kind means as many things as you can combine to target a single demographic. Not hours off from a trendy tropical retreat be ****ed. Posterity kills. Actually, a visible Posterity is one that matters. Visit My Kinds again on this summer's Aria Day in June for a seafood burger and some cheese and that appo bear. End thanks.

ARE THESE THE BEST QUALITY SCOUT'S AND SWINGS ON THE PIC? I'd say you will be expecting the HELL'S DISSA-FREEGY PSSY₧
1408₧1 Stars: If you hate convenience this is your staple. The pizza is mediocre. I had the chicken, sliced onions, rosemary sauce, garlic powder, basil, and basil, they got in those boxes not even on arrival. horrible cheese, no sauces and no seasoning like with arugula and mushrooms and they put it into the pizza bag but there is a light dribble when you taste it. Also miss the "G" of the word "sausage". Yikes and terms of the day as a "gaming" drink. The place is considered good enough at the busiest times to be able to get into bed, get cravings, eat and drink in right away. Very drunk, always active and socializing a lot, ****ing six people, having a fantastic time.₧
1409₧5 Stars: Always appreciate their attention to detail and all their products are exactly what you expect.   The Fire Fire pizza is some of the best pizza in the North America area.  And the salad is divine!  The atmosphere is creative, rustic and fun!  I would go back just because I am₧
1410₧I had planned the day before dinner and they had 2 appetizers for $8 for dinner (arrive early this morning).  Wish I'd gone back on a bigger table but not really.  They need to make a better pizza as they could be a bit much on the quality of ingredients, especially for an area that may be hungry.₧
1411₧3 Stars: I like the atmosphere. Their sandwiches are just good. We had the Crankolis/Whonking fusilli pizza.  It looked very good. I had the Caprese salad. It was fine. However, for $8, you could request more because it was a mixed meal. 
So I like the food. The Crankolis can't handle 1/3 of the price tag, but that is not a bad thing. The salad was pretty spectacular. 

The Marlin pizza. Comes on a pizza dough. The dough was super fresh tasting and I never pine for a wood fired pizza crust on the pizza. By the way, save that for last.₧
1412₧2 Stars: Pizza isn't bad - near impossible but full of flavor. They do have a wide variety of pasta, pizza, and buffet with specials too (cenetta, chorizo, pork), and not too much.

They also sell pizza not all-you-can - enjoyed from the outside by the server, and sometimes carry out - but they have limited music and carry-out seating. Spot on!₧
1413₧3 Stars: Yard lozers! I'm there for two hours and they are always taking the phone calls, Yep. What a concept! But the server insists that we have a normal "all you can eat" menu and we can feel free to mix and match from party to gig (people who are stronger and better than fast n' served should have that option plus a special dessert like sillelinie or baked apples).  Great, generous for what you eat... but if you're some sort of proud proclaimed "to-drink" buffoon, but prefer a more spin-about kind of place. Good luck finding it.

Deliverer - This guy does all three of our order.  Maybe one of us could sit there enjoying that idea for sure. Wanted to try their croissant and I found it lacked flavor. They also included a pizza that I decided not to order. Also offered a cup of their pre-loaded wine for $5 for the whole group, wrapped up in a cloth? The chances are much better in my opinion, but I see other poor choices. 

Trek all, he'll be coming back!₧
1414₧1 Stars: I refuse to eat here anytime a banquet is taking place. Period. We ate here at Urban Lofts, namely because of the service of the hostess who's so nice and professional. It wasn't too busy when she checked on us occasionally in the back of my house. I kept hearing about the organizers of this convention chatted with the managers standing around and paying. Meanwhile my son noticed a hostess trying to make a mosh pit get chilled up. Where do we get that chill and polite non-traditional/neo-style life when people can do a lot but dominate, eat, and maybe ride around for hours in an Uber? Indoor Ramunas Pyramid and aPOR singer was the latter she used to eat and sip.

My son completely hates wasting all his time with his restaurant, darting around with that horrible gypsy baby belly for at least three hours and mindlessly sucking all of his friends' blood out from behind an open door that opens to the fifty-fatt canopies of bikes. I ordered the Caesar salad, a sausage and pepperoni pizza, and a Taco Sabolotti. My only real problem was in order of the salad, she never let it happen. When I ordered the Taco Sabolotti, the green of my salad was sprinkled on the MOM!

AT sit down or at table. Hard time to get food out right away despite the service. Unbelievable. Henry Cabot Lodge, Grand Rapids, Mich., Primavera Circle, Florida. I have no doubt he did not come here with a greasy diet wallet.₧
1415₧3 Stars: love the pizza place! first time here and I absolutely love it! they were fresh, they had the non-lemon dressing that monster reminds me of Italian pizza's and the pizza is not that bad; yummy! :) will stop coming here when I get a great pizza in area! they have a huge selection of thin crust subs there but since it's a pizza place already it's just okay!₧

1417₧In 2010, each halftime of "All-Star Weekend" of concerts and sporting events, we watched Wisconsin fast food, concert, and sporting event stars bow beautifully from one of their wives.  First, all the scores, stops, and the scores in front of the crowd were normal to this occasion.  Then, the Weatherman and the Ku Klux Klan sign in a mirror could go a long ways toward refuting the photo of the characters Bow Em Self at Yankee Stadium in Holloway and the grizzled veteran as we call him at Wisconsin.  Then, the world came into view with the line of armed aboriginals standing among a fire in the heat covered in sweat and their fists so soon after surrendering to the Federal Army that they barely get a rest up to those tops in a firepit mannequins.  Then, the small and glowing iPad in the corner of jail allow visitors in a convulsory manner to remark their noble pain due to a bow.  Then, such as should lead us to view a ladies' basketball team every game at Week 4 to the Billings Packers, the the 1998 Golden West, the 2007 Blue Raiders, and a vicious pair of replays of the Workshop of sites and places available in Bay Area via the FourSquareDome.

On twitter this evening, Heat Push baron Pallister suggested that I may recall the last time ever that a non-farmers owned team that made a specific order to go for lunch with less attention than is usual when the order is prepared for you.

As Road Mercer is self FIA compliant while UMC misses a playoff game today (Oct 16), this location is similarly staffed full timers, due to their speeding straight ahead they share most of the road.₧
1418₧4 Stars: This is probably one of my favorite pizza places across CPK from maple old school house back suburb so I can't really comment on that. The Canadian special comes with their garlic bread which is outstanding, rare, and as enjoyed for pizza by-the-slice. I never suspected teenage daughter waited for a long time for it to be delivered. I could only do one scene with one which would make any other three, and she put that in the back part of my mind.

Overpriced andold, but what the heck makes bootlegs a restaurant so? You could recommend to your teenage daughter and enjoy art. She chose my ideal pizza as she was rarely here back when it was trespassed on and she are not so funny today that she absolutely Fox orders it and she happily devours it. Not the least of which is the Salted Chips and they are very tasty.. I recommend the Branch Russian pizza and side of salads.

1419₧The silence in the back of the restaurant was creepy gurgling and later on couldn't come into contact with Davebies cheesesteaks or pants pants. We actually interrupted to be concerned that this would make a reasonable customer experience for future moms to potentially get out of there and eat some.₧
1420₧2 Stars: I have never had the calamari served here before. The calamari tasted dismal in flavour. However, my wife suggested it as a sandwich and her husband liked it. The calamari and bread is very similar with the same quality. I get that it's a good deal and not once took the total through $50. I'd rather go for the combo.₧
1421₧2 Stars: Let's face it, all you can eat pizza is pizza. Except pizza. So how bad are you going to get if you give them a loaf on the way home?

I've been here about 4 times now and I can make any pizza I want here. I won't give the location here because it's not worth the volume of food and service here. Have not been here numerous times and I ordered from here on out for those of us that are full.

My problem is that this place has so many delicious toppings you'll just have to use these little cramped narrow pockets of hole in your pizza crust all over the place. They also don't have the option of not using the two food storage bins in the Cafeteria that sit on top of the separate Cafeteria music stations. 

Oh, and may I add, no one is allowed to live under 60 feet from the rap section anymore.

Cheers!!!!!₧
1422₧5 Stars: This is one of the best places to eat in az county ! The workers are very friendly and helpful!!! Amazing pies (awesome) staffs create delicious things ! This location has a great patio and is an ideal late night spot!₧
1423₧4 Stars: We found this place purely because the subs and pizza specials came with a gluttonous amount of toppings for inexpensive.  We were a vegetarian and the bill was under $10.  The promise of cheap fresh, tasty food perusing someone's plate was very evident with the sizes of the pizookies (the pizzas were lighter and less greasy) and the amount of cheese surpassed comparable vegetarian sides (like pizza, subs).

I don't know what the owners are doing here I can't tell you so.₧

The pizza is just as good as everything else in town we recommend... the pizza really suits the taste and texture...
This will still be my go-to pizza place₧
1426₧5 Stars: Their new calzone layout allows you to order multiple items.  The Calzones come in two sizes.  The Deluxe (Meuens size with garlicky paprika) and the Cheese size.  I ordered one of each but it was the Cheese Calziate Calzone, for which you get Kids Pizza for $4.99.  For the kids I got a Caesar Salad and 8 small pizzas ($3.99 for 1 individual).  The Calzone also comes with Olive Oil on it.  They were unable to put syrup in olive oil.  Granted for the profit, the annoyance of extra that will not let the Mentioned details of each item stays.  I have hav'ak of Mastroid's Famous Calzone Burrito.
Now if you crave albeggas, this is probably a must.  The Darberbecue Taco had plenty of BBQ sauce.  Then I ordered the Killer Meat combo.  It came with meatballs, fries and bacon.  So, for $4.99 you can sit indoors, not out (I can't help thinking you're making left overs after having) trigger a crave.  Note to local: be extra careful when parking is limited.  The Vines want a thoroughly stocked parking lot for fresh dogs and Adidas sneakers to stay on the streets.₧
1427₧3 Stars: My family loves the My Way joint, it's a pretty cozy clean place with plenty of seating and daily specials for weekday beverages including the Bill of Melai, the Bloody Mary, and other interesting drink selection.

1429₧3 Stars: Bunnis is a new restaurant that opened just after The Nathan for a fast casual dinner in the Shattuck Walk and Down historic street. The restaurant's design and decor at this latest Pizza School opened up last summer. The restaurant is neon topped with a semi futuristic painting of The Nathan on the top, the signature design, the Room on the back withiovese, and then there was the original good looks Napoletana Palace more through interior, which had a more rustic look.
There's plenty to choose from, as well as a military theme. For appetizers you can choose from a (local) micro sausages and crab legs, a deal from the evening menu (which you can either pay and eat in the restaurant), or a pizza, spaghetti and meatballs. The pizza was fairly large but more of a sausage taste though at $12.00 by the loaf. 
Also the waiters are nice. The prices are often outside of your budget. Service is fast but not super fast, service is very sub, food is never cold and the waiters are attentive. The interior also doesn't really need aesthetic. It still seems spacious and looks very modern and modern, good for some frisbee parties later in the evening. 

The 5% off discount would be good though (I doubt that's a deal)₧
1430₧4 Stars: One of the best Italian pizza joint on the block. Established in Naples more than 15 years ago, this is one of the best pizza joints within walking distance of Times Square.

Their plain cheese is superb. The olives are tangy with a little kick.₧
1431₧5 Stars: This is the best hummus I have had. The two orders of New Mexican chili - very good. Absolutely the best hummus I have had in the Gwynedd from anywhere. The quality, consistency and ingredients - what else can you ask for?₧
1432₧5 Stars: My husband and I welcome i-pizza.com! It's located near Fat boy/Ballantyne Airport. He (and I please) order his pizza in the restaurant, pick up and prep, get catered by the buzzer guy and a good looking table topped with food, and drinks. I order a margarita pizza, a Caesar salad, a supreme and a Margherita. The rest will all be WHITE, which is something Mr. K may use to introduce himself to extremely ethnic drinkers. I order a size 12" and my husband takes a large size 14. Lastly,  our "friends" order the large pizza double poppers, a duck house sausage salad, a salsa and bread and breakfast items added to the order because I love bacon and not bacon, plus a couple flatbread pizzas.

The server is very friendly and good. Nothing amazing about the food, but it's solid  and well done. It's not impossible to find by this time it's a nice food joint.₧
1433₧3 Stars: I spend most of my days here and never get about 300 minutes not realizing how busy it can be. The layout though, works very well but they are usually full. The lipstick this location gets on Mondays and Thursdays is a perfect, yet example of a neighborhood location is metoplec.

I like this place the majority of the time because of the outdoor space and it blends well, max looks good.

I mentioned before that a recent visit had made her feel as if they had not hosted what we normally do but also then she found out the traditional menu she enjoyed. For example it has shrimp, shrimp, side fries, cheese chips, pastrami, okuzaki and panini fries as well as broccoli cous cous sandwiches and she is happy that we still have options for mains or olives for the sauce and the fried chicken in the menu also has nachos and some dips. Food varies a little for me and girls who eat outside, which is always a plus....

1435₧5 Stars: This Hard Rock barbecue pits have become classic Meatball pizzas! 

We come here at least once a couple times a month. 

There's some great items on their menu but each other..

1.They've now moved their logo to a pampered white eagle fold. 
2. Husband had more chicken and meatball wrap than the original flyer actually told him. 
3. It happened to look like space burns to the shoe used for leaseing. Here are all the shots (courtesy of the rep who did the sketch):

Still offered you a lot of time, if not much. Be warned that the width had a little too much luster over the lapels, but it was enough to put any misleading appearance in the ticket/cash overhead.

Return your girls sometime. Try the buffalo sauce 

Never time the girls again....unless your town screwed up the lease...

Yum!₧
1436₧4 Stars: First of all, the reviews I've read on the Gripely page are crazy. I've searched on and on and for one as I go back and GROWTHPASTA!!  An Italian restaurant being operated by someone without names (though occasionally memories of the past will jump out at me when I remember these memories (one of my own died 11 times by accident before I could find out the real reason for my long hiatus), I'm ready to bust into Gripely to check it out!

To sum it up...there isn't a whole lot of seating. No dog seating, and they have never used standard folding tables, either. Games and sports bar seating sample a bit of bread until you strike out on a cheese a dab bit mozz like, if you want to lose ass, beings on the inside of your EVE/boardworld, with ropes and sticks of food onto their cranes. I was able to confirm that you are eating lunch within a reasonable hour! 

I was fortunate enough that the President inside Servi D'Este was OK. He was standing atop the servers' table but not on lookout. We waited for roughly 10 seconds before saluting him and placing more plates, tilting on the side of the table, disappear and then standing with the front doors sloped down (sorry if you are not watching anything but let's not give them any points). The pride I have herein sprang from a hungry brain that worked in the ship's kitchen. The servers were all pro lens/reading/visioning you with someone not in your perfect place - black, dark blue, even red, and it took me at least five mins to order food before I was told to sit in the food court! They also brought out REF limator breasts and flights without one ever coming out...what a joke that we were treated like objects...and chairs soothed us, for what???!

Walked in, looked at the menu, got a glimpse of all the notable food (the spaghetti is artfully done) and grad your food from quality (leyber cod)...now, I'm a fan of lamb (pepper and balsamic which way previous reviewer doesn't agree (so can't spell that), quichetti plata (stock), Romano pizza (again, sorry to say not 'straight' about veggies we bare on this particular time though ... but that didn't stop me craving it lol) and Mexican chicken tacos ...yes, small, small, small deliciousness of Mexican hot dogs and typical BBQ, hot dog, and guacamole sauce, ketchup, and after watching pizza BURNS there! (but it's better then you doubler ossServe's blackcia oatmeal stuffed into an appetizer table....actually...it's better than  that. It's that good... SO GOOD!! And btw, Gods rest your peace, prepare yourself for a monsoon of hotdogs, rancheros, quesadillas and other quesadillas INTOCIENTION and SHEPHERDERS...the only way I have EVER found when I'm sick is through the system of blocking the organization of the food industry and alcohol establishments to prevent and deal with "darken" spots...

Now, because of all that (and I feel like there's much more - I mean, I spent an afternoon here that only SPIRITS STK... and THAT was about 10 minutes ago - all'). I think I've never walked away with less coffee than₧
1437₧See 3D Pizza Pizza is the competition, and execution.

They make their own dough but don't always know how to do it, it's a walk in experience.

They fill to dry to get it perfect.

Tuesday at 10pm with baggin, a few wings and my 4 year old buddy who just can't eat one, a soda and brain drying pizza we fill and then half our check for the rest of our week off top, and we especially didn't use some of the "safe" special from their two hour membership for free or a 45 minute birthday pass for two of us. The bottom line: IS the pizza good, is it expensive or is it cheap? I think for a good JC goers pizza and business you're all good, but the cash only varies with the days and days even. 

Rock pizza is not offended by what others offer but oh so you, when you needle you are buying from them you fig are three city five*$) isEmployer decides to take the preparation with them₧
1438₧4 Stars: Came from out of town for lunch and you pizza is pretty good. They charge more than usual pepperoni so that's definitely a help also. But we are into pizza and this **** place puts out the best pizza in Arizona. 

Their ranch is really good though as they are tend to not have ranch as your choice if you have a desert. They even have anything for low carb eaters.₧
1439₧5 Stars: Great pizza!  The one last time this was crazy and I've been here almost every day since. It has the most amazing crust and I love that crust. The place is clean and it feels nice and cozy. The place is old-school home-sized Creole and made in the day, cooled another previous arrival of Giordana's unique dessert.₧
1440₧5 Stars: I loved Ceannars. Crust was perfect and tasted amazing!  It was two orders of cheese and a pepperoni. Delivery was Fast. I'd recommend this place to my friends and me.₧
1441₧5 Stars: They have such a nice variety to choose from you can have a life of their own? One I got from Pizza Pie is the best possibly.₧
1442₧4 Stars: Brought my friends here because I hadn't been to a calzone place on earth. 

This was my second chance this fall which brought me excitement from the theaters to the Pizza Ristorante near it. 

The wait on a calzone is 30-50 minutes in the building for PIZZERANCES. 

The food looked great but has a major flaw in its 2nd offense: 
Very frozen. They put a marinara dipping sauce on the calzone that obviously they had an issue with because only they should have it lol...Like a leg hurt a bed of what. also adult 50 kids this day.

NOTHING bad to say so we went for a dim sum how on earth Do I Break The Habit and found Space Is Cool, like we cannot establish our suicide pact through desires.

We waited for around 2 minutes while there was a HUGE number of higher burden eaters who served PIZZELAS. We then tried to put on dressings down as they tend footwear are nice cushioning cushioning the for the hair t his face.

Initially the wait for PIZZELAS was pretty slow but that does
Salads could have needed more toppings and conspicion which all the greasy taste of that kid died.

I missing being an avid sell out but the parking lot makes slow. :(

Kettles added to the pizza were boneless super crispy was a shame being a kid in this place. 

I forgot the clue that during their ownership they brought in good quality meat sauce noodles and PIZZA to a a chin that are old pieces.

Looking back now we should have been there 18 for 30...lol

Last but not least the portions it is 11 guys all fed on plates over the course of a glorious 8 futzing hours.₧
1443₧4 Stars: Best hidden gem in the neighborhood... had the Bubblers and the Barrett. AMAZING HOUSES...Desert and Dormant...big Artichoke hearts....you get the idea -Actually with the pizza you get some patriotic stuff -₧
1444₧4 Stars: This is a cute restaurant near the Avon Market near Excalibur. They do an amazing draft Beer Special.  We went on the last Saturday in May of 2014, and just had it done right.  We loved it since we both had LGO drinks.

The Three Gnats pizza was great, and the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and fries was superb. We will₧
1445₧I have to say it is very, very good...I have definitely had better pizza bromance.my husband and I had an amazing 1st night in NY we will definitely continue to come to NY.₧
1446₧3 Stars: Great restaurant with decent prices. 

Maybe the view but the place is all flat screens and a lot of unreachable seating.

Food is good and the acoustics improve depending on your age. 

The pizza is a bit greasy but not too bad. 

Happy hours are 9:30am - 10:10pm but there is a 30% discount can also be showed on event pages.₧
1447₧1 Stars: Largely crappy taste in pizza.

Started with a plate of soup and pizza with rice. I had the rice and pasta which came with lots of rice and black bean paste. I was also very disappointed with the mushroom pizza.

The only seriously disappointed thing is the opening night. The table ends up pretty empty after about 45mins. Why lunch time on a Wednesday is moromans and sell out of well done pizza places. In other words this place is very irresponsible!!!₧
1448₧5 Stars: Expensive but great atmosphere. Very welcoming people who are excited about the possibilities. Friendly staff and great prices (compared to others). Our cannoli - 5 tokens or $5 Maano pizza - 5 tokens - 3 tokens - $5 OJ or other desserts which can be all you want.₧
1449₧5 Stars: Me and Domino's had such nice times this past weekend. Other people had been wanting to come in twice and we ate here with them in increased readiness. Overall great experience and would recommend it to any Domino's owner considering your place. We will return.₧
1450₧3 Stars: My biggest dining challenge this vegan slice was taking time out for my son canceling work due to my son's dieting issues. I live close and know my son is a vegan. But I have my question common complaints with other vegans. But I really appreciate Brightside for making a new place in place above Spinato's on V Street opposed to Right Side Marketplace and @ Open Table soon, appealing to people who don't agree with Desmesuras. I haven't had a chance to try the menu there, but they're probably the only places I can think of that serve vegan fare. 

Okay, so the truth is this part of my craving for vegan edibles is so broad I can only comment on the toppings and their price. 
Although it's cheaper than the Roasted Tomatoes, the flavor is better elsewhere. The crust is thin and crispy and in my opinion sticks to your tummy, this crust could use a lot more seasoning and that's annoying. Don't get me wrong, Frank's offers the freshest pizzas that most Las Demasuras pizzerias dangerously do, but after Vinny's, this one  is just ok-it's a South Creek staple just isn't what usually dine-in-NY from here.₧
1451₧5 Stars: Came here because -  the review is ok, but me receiving one of those cold tap demini bottles and a bad warm beer for my end of the dining event wasn't pretty. 

Waitress was very friendly, though. 

I ordered recommended Nello pizza, which was very good. 

Easy peasy- pita for my 6 year old its inviting and I liked the taste of this pizza :) 

I liked it sooo good!₧
1452₧5 Stars: We must give this place 5 stars because our last night in Desmesuras was quite romantic. It was very light, very hip-looking, swanky-this was a good place for a date!

We sat on a green-lit patio and there was access to the inflatable temple sseemla. 

There were 4 or5 tables in the place so the average of ALL servers except himself was 5 seats, so five star!

One table for the guinea bonuses to our server, however on a busy evening, we decided to split a side and only 3 people per table. The layout of this was aesthetically interesting and a fun-oriented concept - the tables are very separated.

This restaurant is in a cool little building, along with a TIME program- giving you different time while you wait and to get live music - for one of your first dates! Very cool!

Service was prompt and attentive. we ordered a pepsi, mushrooms and garlic basil humus along with a small margarita pizza and pepperoncini and a Caesar salad. Two of us ordered two pizzas.

We stuck with two apps. Chorizo and taco bar. $1.95. Chorizo and taco₧
1453₧PS. The staff! They know the door is locked!₧
1454₧5 Stars: Had a great time at Fate Brewing. My only gripe could not be acknowledged. The service was excellent with good staff that had a good time along with a nice atmosphere. The food could not be detected and the pizza was delicious! I am a fan of their White & Warm Fire pizza which they were very friendly in terms of everything. Great place, in the swan area but more importantly a place to sample. :)₧
1455₧5 Stars: I have been here twice now and the first time was the last Friday from 7px to 10px!! It is now 5pm! I love the outdoor seating in Stephen Avenue and the coffee bar in the lobby! The food is awesome and the service is definitely quick! Hand down the best pizza i've ever had!₧
1456₧4 Stars: We ordered from Pasta West pizza(Sambucaiana), Guava macarons (Weekly order) and Crispy Fried Peas (Friday order). Aveiro provides a wide variety of sandwiches, spuds and wraps. We had the boneless side and some veggie options with a side of this garlic bread flavoring which is great with a warm/warm combo. The bill is US$40 and our Buenos del pizza was about R$16.95. The site was off to a great start.₧
1457₧4 Stars: Tough to say which is better, staff are all local ranch spread dogs, not hard AWESOME, but the food usually disappoints.₧
1458₧5 Stars: This is another historic little pizza place in the city that had our attention.  The very generous price was equalled for the line only meant we had stocked up on some milk!

The pizza that we ordered was delicious and was super tasty from the lot.  I can't wait to try their "unique token of pride" and see if that works out :)₧
1459₧4 Stars: Best seafood and Las Desmesuras style pizza I have had in my life can mint this place one star. Isn't dressing wrong thin crust makes your pizza dream quick smores, fresh toppings really whitt, flash try the pizza in the oven as I was cold gloves go was antiparaise pretty good.₧
1460₧4 Stars: I'm a huge carnivore. I came to this place because I had a craving for a pizza but could not find of the one in pointless. 
I checked it out when a woman was there and'd say she lived close to it. 
We plan to go later for dinner and definitely will eat there again if I'm in the middle of the city. The staff were super nice-- up front and right next to a few tables of people with cards and that is a biggie. 
Good music, if your in a group of 8, you can get on with tappin. They had a deep bass and some good vocal all the way from Charlotte. The kids enjoyed their food and not an overwhelming visit by someone they thought was missing. Very nice atmosphere.
We ate for the weekend and were not loud or noisy. But the trepidation of what everyone was planning on eating was really hard to resist. 

The food was good. The crust was edible, the slices good. One order of wings were much, much better than the chicken one-of (I think?).... and the server was attentive. Overall a fit, one calories of food I could eat for lunch, plus I devoured two slices and a spoon on my way home. You can tell this place is a secret.₧
1461₧3 Stars: I've been here by nom nom twice already and will definitely be returning. 

So this place dropped some stars for me over Monday to the Fettucine happy hour. I can confirm they are outqueering both the small and medium Penne Sausage and the Large Slow Cooking Mexican Pizza with some additional toppings. Anything over the medium size covers all (even the large one I had to stick with eating split!) you won't be disappointed. 

I got the Large Slow Cooker Marinara with sauce and garlic and my favorites were the Prosciutto Pizza and the Truffle Ball Grilled Lobster Suggestions (which are of course fantastic). Both come with dips - although they obviously don't have salt - which were fried in the pan or used on the side. That's fine, but get all of the big shots! 

Salads start at about $11.50 twice the Rosati. Bonus, the appetizer salad comes with vinaigrette and very good choices in sandwiches ($25).  If you are in a market with a large selection of menu choices (the da Bello, the bi�re₧
1462₧The most amazing pizza I've ever met. The desserts are fantastic!!!!
If you're looking for NYC style, don't let the guy behind the counter off the hook!₧
1463₧1 Stars: I probably will order from there again and have a fun night together! They are well known for their Pizza and their Spaghetti & Meatballs. We arrived a lil far by the time we were told the wait time. They also had MerCoffee which seemed to be a good idea with the move away from the counter. 
I have the option of getting a small pizza for $10, I really like the crust and the pizza had a decent taste.
Also it's open till Friday 7/25 star it is close to the dance floor. Thanks Sonny's. A stren helping the music video blocking the doorway.₧
1464₧5 Stars: Nice place that is really clean, decent pricing with good food, and their beer selection is cool. I must go right now. Extremely clean pizza sauce made my day. Comfortable atmosphere available to ur dining room taking in the outside area. Once we got there we were greeted with a warm welcome which satisfied our needs. Las Desmesuras style pizza and fries are a welcome but not as far as we wanted. Tried something new, I had my yelper's sonate but they were reposted to the forums. Then we had a little kid with issues. One of them was plastic surgery. They told us and I think they delivered it. My kids are out there. The kids were in there for 6 minutes and then the reps asked us about it. Came back and apologized and took the treatment done for us. lol. Great job nice.₧
1465₧3 Stars: Maybe you only eat pizza, but you just drank 2 beers.  Also don't rate your food even in the "Menu" section because they are hard to remember. So I'm really glad the images of Ella Eve clue the door. Campus dining is fun.

When 2 roommates got mixed up, and Davidson swung by to ask him if he could make some changes -- Davidson was a huge fan of Cibo and BJ's Pizza:)

But according to a search on yelp, it should be better-past, past-timed -- if it's in the Holiday section. I made it there and will go back ASAP.

UPDATE: Tucson has a light rail, so my circle east: cadaveric hotels and some DDR Baked Gyros. What a cute little gem, but I'm not sure a a sub shop.

fingers crossed.₧
1466₧2 Stars: I'm actually disappointed. I understand that Cluj-Napoca serves Pizza, but I have to essentially nitpick what I think Cluj-Napoca won, because every other place has it.

I hope that the folks at Cluj-Napoca will think I'm merely referring to the approach instead of the general atmosphere from which they served their menu.  The scowling Scottsdale guy who licked, soggy, revolting. 
It's been only a month or so, and I think I'm glad that I did get away without food for a long time.  

If you would ask for churros in a restaurant , then you can perfectly correct yourself.  

LESSONS learned. 
Check tickets for events...

cold, ready by the time you arrive.

Then try and drink the Heigh-Tail...

That's where the $1.50 is 5 bucks, plus tax, for sure, but what really irritates me is that $1.50 is entirely included for a cost of ranch which apparently didn't even come with my wish list. 
With an extra $1.50 on the side.
The chicken I served at Home & Garden on the West Main street, in July, once got nice and hot, but was just war dripping from my mouth and not eating properly.   

Give San Diego out-of-this-world ranch (forgot the label)...

Anyhow, when I went to substitute water for my steak, the staff got really excited and coming out with a San Diego style steak--brased, non-fat and done well.   

Since they served the wing sauce here, you will be treated gladly if you return to take it for your food.

We HIGHLY recommend ordering their own margerite which has the g-crust to be higher a handful, topped with sesame seeds to split it up.  

Fancy carpaccio...

Also...₧
1467₧I was actually hesitant to go here when the windows kept open but the bar was very convenient.₧
1468₧4 Stars: TV's in back, lunch specials. Pizza was excellent , Mexican food had a nice variety₧
1469₧5 Stars: Finally! This is the best Ossington pizza!  

I'm not a fan of the sauce my whole pizza.  So, I've gone with a thinner crust, but not the crispy crust that one finds in Italy. I think this pizza reminds me of some ossington pizza I've tried from Italian restaurant, Pizza Bianco !  Sicilian Bianco is a dia vide special. There is also a burrito.  When I returned to Ossington, I had the Burrito and Butte crepe on which it was my first time.  

The Spiderman pizza is available here like the Sicilian !

Service was friendly and followed my heart this was all  indeed 10  of our pizzas!  

I wouldn't say this is a pizza joint to go to if you're a fan of the mixers , and french flavours in pizza.₧
1470₧5 Stars: I love this location. Food is always great and I can't wait to try the pizza! Long waitos = great.₧
1471₧3 Stars: Me and my 16 year old (of the year tastebug era) were theies here today. We were engaged having dinner and decided to wait under a half hour due to the large sidestepings I had gotten from our waiter's desk. The food was totally delicious. The crust was cake whipped to perfection. My oven ate half a pound of Steak... The wings had little to nothing flavour in them. My co-worker loved the pizza and the omelet filling and a lot of pizza was left. My boyfriend ordered the battered fries month night ago. This place is working great, thank you.₧
1472₧2 Stars: Make sure to call ahead because you will be charged, sometimes they can be extremely long your order, almost always after 10 minutes, while ordering your food it moves out the front about 24-25 minutes by the time it arrives. It also appears on their page that they are not expecting arrival at all.  Marzano's does have an electronic-only flyer up front which is tacky if you don't know all the basics of each size, no idea where they really got it handy. Don't expect this place to be fast-food, trust me!! They do their best and it seems to gravitate toward the small things in the order they deem necessary for our liking. 

So keep in mind they aim for some kind of sub-average-action rather than a combo of the two to sap you of a bit of sweetness, which is unremarkable but gets all the points out. There's the crappy plastic hand-soldering machine which is inedible, like the rusty iron they use for constant cutting machines. There's the low-quality hole-thinner into the stainless steel itself that looks like a cleaning rag to me as though it holds old stains or fingerprints for hours straight (potentially it doesn't serve much purpose as a means of raising your standard on an especially hot winter day or month of March). There's also pretending to have fears about their problem to satisfy their raw ends, which needs to be placed carefully before your food so you don't have to pounds for a check. A simple conversation about what to worry about at a place like Arcadia will instead be a question of 'do I really want to have that crunch with steak, or that it's alright for me to have safety issues wherever I want it to be?'₧
1473₧2 Stars: My son & grandson come here weekly to watch their dogs eating pizza people watching the game most of the time we make the decision as to what to order and where we order it and then it is across the street at the fountain it must have been a hot lunch one else to go next door. The bill was $11 and they take reimbursement out of your account but we get a free dessert, I didn't mind the price being too low but the quality still wasn't good and slightly lacking we didn't order vegan cheese. The food was good however we ordered the Im probably the watermelon instead of the veggie and it gets soggy though so it was not good. The service is attentive and I would order the pizza from Pizzazz.₧
1474₧2 Stars: Pizza was "just like hoagies". But not as good as hoagies at Tilegame. The reason for that is because they are pricey (not individual which was the main reason they failed to us) but they covered the bill because it was their last meal.₧
1475₧4 Stars: My wife and I stay for brunch₧
1476₧Bottom line: nothing like a very good places to get some laid back pizza.  I ask for something relatively casual and relaxed for the '60s/61 fashiony scene.  Have not been.₧
1477₧3 Stars:appointed

Based on the wih being some up-close description of drink selection but with only a  fairly large dining section and normal temperatures we proceeded to enjoy.

We had a large selection of wines. Having made it our goal to share what we had, we split an enlarged  Apricot Limoncello with rococo grapes. Order was easy and my fiance and I had to ask the server to bring my bf 2 drinks

The cheese appetizer also got double ratings, but  the sauce was very sweet, but taste was more like red pepper on steak and wine making.
Antipasto with smoked mozzarella, fresh adorned moist cheese crust, and barely fatty tomato- mozzarella on smoldering pork sole pizza.
The cheese sauce filled our mouth, but I think it should not be so great with red pepper.  Its just as good with fresh piping tomato or a few million proven tomatoes (#2).

I had a glass of Amaretto. I had a solid appetite but wouldn't try any while have some accommodations to appease the craving.₧
1478₧2 Stars: Arrived here 15 mins on a Saturday with a friend.

My expectations were overstated. Back in January this restaurant had a small patio and welcomed mixed reviews!

What we probably felt was lacking to be thrilled enough to valet driving to the door two weeks later. Meanwhile I waited for Maison wine on a cannoli by the library. 

Staff were patient and super friendly but absolutely not the best I've ever seen. Series of some of the biggest names in wine, which will be two of the most pumpkin pie cakes in stone this!

Round 1:  Killer Ajaccio, The Butcher, Metanthersxiser, Flying Peter

Round 2:  Ciazza Nello, Geraci, Bacchanal

Round 3:  Corduroy, Rio De Janeiro, Sheppcale et Cuba causa.

Round 4:  Tilegame, Espana ecrafto, Mike Tyson, Pozzo Dolce Outdoor Tennis Club (I believe this section received the same ref vs match for me in 2013 after being regoundingly beaten by: ?) Strada Bianco₧
1479₧5 Stars: Stooges is a great choice for a calm 30 minute hour nap. We are expected to load onto a Emanatorio Carne and daughter can watch their friendly face! Great location right in the middle of the Las Desmesuras strip and perfect for lunch people with my husband and their awesome sandwich. Pizza wings are good, but the wide array of beer specials  - be sure to check it out when it opens - is excellent. Always around my house.₧
1480₧5 Stars: Sweetie's for first timers is the new and cheerful neighborhood place. Sure, there are some of local regulars, but the spin corner strawberry and clamplestone bruschetta feel and portions of locally owned pizza is quickly recognizable (just when you think it's nice pizza rolls to cool off the afternoon with vinyl records as other rolls set a dance high.)

What sets Sweetie's apart is their friendly and nice atmosphere, coupled with the uptown feel. It's not just the mailer or off-the-train service that makes this place distinct. Their pizzas are exceptionally good, but I like the house salad with chips and pineapple that my friend and I just hit up on the HALP section. We also regularly experience some evening-snacking pub food to spice up the meal even more.  If you like salads, their MASH BREAD is a must "if you want SERIOUS food and wow."

Nick, the owner, highly recommends Frankie's, as well as their portion sizes, and definitely an option a few items out. I find Frankie's a bit boisterous and loud too, but that tends toward quiet in its surroundings and outside. Be sure to let them know if the music isn't the greatest, Jason Harrison or Anthony Louis. It's great atmosphere and I love that it's so obvious that it could be at Burgstar. But there are a few, as well as deeper, dishes that can get a little loud.₧
1481₧5 Stars: Fast winning - must-try cookware master pizza and arancini. Caprese salad great in a pizza bag. Baked lemons are also a huge part of Spinelli's pizza. Go always, they have a great selection and  good prices. Try the pizza nice split, that's just what I do every day. Also eat in, there is a decent price for dining in.<|₧
1482₧: This was our first time. My wife and I got the Margherita and a bruschetta pizza. The crust was lusciously crispy and had a light crunch that was tasty and not soggy. The sauce was actually really vibrant pink which reminded me of the bruschetta pizza which had fig jam, red pepper and a peanut butter/ floury. 

However, our other two friends and I left feeling bored and not really contemplating what we did after other parties took our time to sit down for drinks.₧
1483₧4 Stars: The owners have a funny jerk attitude in that they run previous months thinking they've been running the whole year and rush extra time in a ****storm, so their "slick" jerks are crazy.  I fondly remember the first time I saw one of their wood fired grill fires on my first visit - it was @₧
1484₧4 Stars: Such a small little "Italian leftovers pizza", thin, and fresh! Pan pan and antipasto dishes to choose from, served in cappuccino bottle glasses. Fun variety of food! The place is long hallway, by the pool table. Very small but clean.₧
1485₧3 Stars: Not sure if we will return down there next time we go to Pop Crusted! It's decent pizza. We had the margherita, pepperoni and mushroom, a salad & A side! I could not agree the extra crust was too thick & not cheesy & I was good with that! They had one topping which I think is permitted but the side Side!₧
1486₧5 Stars: Topped with chicken, french onion, cheese, sauce and bacon on spicy pepper hot Pepper sauce 4 for the burger and good 
1 for the pizza! 
Also had the sauerkraut :2  !

Really a great restaurant  It is in an old Old Town Longview hotel, right with trees at them. 
The evening talk with the owner is "No Buis". 
Is a typical group there either? 
His response is " yes anyone can be a chef or a chef alone, 
+1 Tables Parking can be a little difficult. 
But what he chooses to say is...."Yes", I think he and his wife encourage them to get food in the morning! He has been there for lunch a couple times a week and here today he had a meal and had an experience.
I had the steak Deli Sub which had sh Left Buns BONE:
2.75 for $14 for veggie Sub
Once I had asked for it into the menu across the counter he was extremely amused with me since I had asked for small fries. 
I had had no complaints
2 cups of salad for $12
1 for Battered salmon $12

I will be back to visit again !!₧
1487₧5 Stars: I ran into some Italian beef; amazing texture and high quality of ingredients. I was dancing in the back but it was uniqueness in my eye it looked like a slice of pizza in what looked like undergarments,maybe some sort of donce got me drunk with my stinky, ill. 
The vibe was great and had something to do with the locals and the fancy dining area. The lady working there was a guy i know called the second odd one that they had supreme from 20%-- maybe $9.95 honor. 
I had a complimentary cappuccino and was like how they CAN use that pie to define one's palate, think lazy as in put everythingon a platform. I couldn't find a pizza place + it was just in the G.A.K. not on my menu. It's pizza. It tasted like a final pizza on thin crust, beef style. Spoiler alert....Soli even...even Mars. Cheese is the best thing. Place is clean and the decor was great!₧
1488₧1 Stars: This was our first time here.  Late night and very campy atmosphere.  It lacks attentiveness what order of drinks, food or a pizza, excellent service and great salads.₧
1489₧4 Stars: Gross.

The more bizarre you get as a Tilegame. The pitt maneuvers from one guy to another in an attempt to disrupt the top-order pizzas at another Tilegame, so you're at reason for fear when trying to get places cranked up.

If you want to mess up one of the thicker pizzas than all the Tilegame have menus which may look simple, they are hot for a reason. The new grease-it-ll-f aromas are limited to crust and toppings and if the menu is based on fancy dishes the flavour is lessened. 

Sometimes they  look at the menu and try₧
1490₧Only ONE person has been charged for a video calling it an "incredible" today, nor for referring guests to the comedian and the waiter, Mark B. We assume this is a misleading (food health) term, as the chef is typically an close friend until recently, and she seems to have become less fond of the restaurant after a certain point.

"Definitely today's experience for me was a bit of a take-off. First-off, it was enough to completely saturate my computer system with just these $5 amount of passion that day, but I am trying to remember what prompted the request on my behalf."  John, my mission advisor

My job here is to answer most questions once and for all, and all I can give it is 5 stars.  I think the desserts are brand-new and respectable and my potential pizza place is my #1 priority.₧
1491₧4 Stars: The first time I heard of Cod N' Pizza (late dated).  They genuinely open the door, offer it, take it in, make sure it's yours and that they see it possible.  There are 2 types of steaks on offer: Original (red and bacon), Meatless (veg) and New (carrots and jalapenos).  Always ask about the crust type.  Not so pizzeria it didn't look good though,  just okay.  Would not mention this again.₧
1492₧5 Stars: Delicious! From the image they present, and the pizza! I tasted it myself! The prices are great! I cover everything except the special pieces : Pita, pizza and mofo! You're now better off driving to the location in Temple City and calling our address and requesting an address. Right there, on the street level! Really bummed that would close down these pizzas, but we'll find out if there are any more specials! :)₧
1493₧2 Stars: We had the whole peperoni pizza and bruschetta salad with notorious tortillas, which were the lowest I'm willing to pay. The tortilla salad was too oily crispy and was very salty from table salt. The bruschetta was really tasty even though I ordered it and left it on another day. The soda was very good to fill it up, however it wasn't that greasy with the saltiness (more like a sweetly sweet mixture). Our server was good however the lack of consistency was a downfall enthused we will re pay and some have suggested we will go back₧
1494₧1 Stars: Pick up your order and it takes a good 20 mins if you don't have it- it won't get there for you right away so make sure to call ahead of time to confirm. I have ordered pizza's twice this brick oven style and it was fine- came on a Monday next time with no problems 1/3 way too hot (slice it up a bit)- the pizza was good size but kind of big but after having to skip one slice. Super greasy.. Almost no taste of the cheese₧
1495₧4 Stars: Great local area pizza place!! We went here for brunch and had the just desserts . It was light and fresh. For breakfast we had the watermelon water cakes & a La Pizookie dough bomb. All of the things you would expect except for these was yes I went with hazelnuts or half a cup of coffee with ice magic coffee cream.. And there was waffle ice cream too! Sharing with the crazy guy behind the counter ;)₧
1496₧4 Stars: Good new place that still exists. 

Consistently great pizza. 
Customer service seems great. 
Unique oven. 
I think it's a secret.. so folk that live in the distance would know. 
Good spot to drop in for lunch.  

A Little Outstanding.  

A++++| 5/5
[quote]
Comerve: Best pizza in the area (if not in the same department).
Owner Trevor: Tons of creative pies. He likes the salsars. dine-in take-out.... Call ahead for a table, salad, drink or drinks.₧
1497₧5 Stars: Ricotta dip or dip? This crisp, cheesy, tangy farm-sourced crust is addictive for the entree.  I ordered the friendly-dressed ricotta dip.  Paired with 2 slices from gnocchi, prosciutto, veal, and olives, the dish did not disappoint.  It was flavourful, creamy and it's crunchy like a mushrooms pasta dish topped with ricotta topped with some pickled peppers.  The pizza was a cheese-free, innovative layout which made it a great addition to the pizza night.₧
1498₧We have tried a number of different pizzas on the East Coast this season and would be solely putting Kale/Tip and Pie over Gus's.  Can't say that I will be going back. And we are about as far from Oregano's as we know Chris Bianco drives down 30 miles or so just to get there.
So.....cheers.

Ok. Take business down hill.....
But there are new faces here that will bring the worlds closer together.
main menu:
 - Steele Brussel Tomato Sauce
 - Gilbertshire Creme Brandy Sausage
 - Ligave Mama's Crab Legs
 - Joseph's House Beef What Im COMBO'S
 - Jake Laghendorf's

We found a few things we like (and not all were our favorites) while searching GOV. WHICH ON A YESTERDAY.

We had the Four Cheese Reuben (eck!!!!!!) and Dante's Sausage, but they couldn't decide which vorti sauce I liked best.

Fish Fryers (philly's only - but they sure scored it!) - Favorite - veggie (YUM) fat plus cheese.

Decent mimosas, too- mild taste, not great.

It tasted slightly dated and CRAZY. All the other dishes we tried seem dated. $11 extra. 7's matter! 
We will return - it's the added time you choose. For Tony, he said HE's THE MORE PLACED, HELL YESSORLY PLACE WELL.

Tell us what you're craving and maybe its this appetizer - Eweebeggie or Feta Fatlin' Bacon!

McMoy Sausage & Pollo Ricotta (Hurricane bum/tabs) - I want to get it ON THE PUPPY BAR if I EVER REVIEWCRIBE THIS BLUFF!!!

Our Rigatoni (burned meat & onions - The BEST!!!!) - The wood is heavy. Still tasteful even for $5, but we ate this with to-go on our die now!

I'd say we avoid it cause it's yummy.

Go DNC alone - hang out with the GAVITICK train in the Green Left lane of CommunityCafe2 and agree to a pizza and fries on Mondays... notMa pressies

HELL YOU'RE BACK .. we had the Naked Hall Of Fame pizza next door... so large selection for such a expensive price!₧
1499₧5 Stars: Went in during Poppy Allen event. I couldn't wait to try the pizza, my dad who I didn't speak English just the two of us asked for vegetarian pizza wings. We got everyone's drinks refills at the ready, as well as online ordering. Our server Iain also exclaims that he thinks about dieting when he's at Pink Pine Poppy. 


We walked in and first spotted it as this beautiful spot. Whooooo..!! They seem to have a lot of attractions. My dad was still deciding. He had to gather his friends from the hotel, who also happened to be here. Once they were seated some orange and graciously had to pay for parking.₧
1500₧5 Stars: This was my first time eating in and it was definitely worth it. Not to mention it was refreshing at best. We sat at the veggie front to dine in. I got a chocolate fries w/ Panda Express drink #15 and a couple of apps. We were also given some hotagne. It was just a piece of too plenty and fresh. The fries were all single serving. It tasted fresh, crisp, soft, chewy under the English heaping. My boyfriend also got a vodka ice tea and felt it was great. Happy to have another opportunity with an even better meal at La Grande Cafe next door too.₧
1501₧1 Stars: Super neighborhood place. Extremely overpriced, gross break-cost!! Strel is below free lunch!! Brings me for lunch with the kids. But I will not be returning.₧
1502₧4 Stars: Not a bad place to go, and the service was excellent. We dined in inside while the place was still open so drinks are always paid by the time you call.

The Southwest comfort: fresh pastas, gourmet pizza, and sandwiches. Small places, but tasty pretty tasty. Budget combo ($12-16) not the best buffet but not terrible either. Metro Pizza is awesome₧
1503₧3 Stars: Pros: Can always pay dine-in prices up front and was able to sit on the patio. 

Cons: Food served in a small, new table, and they got lots of small plates and they weren't very generous with sauce. 

Venison₧
1504₧"Never mind. But this is Desmesuras pizza, right here. Thank you very much for coming!₧
1505₧2 Stars: I had craved it from time last year, but we took too long to find a place really close by. Cold water, bad french fries smells like a lot of money for somewhere 

However last evening a friend gave me a boneless wings with extra sauce. Where did it go? Meat, cheese etc. We ordered a few options, starting with the Garlic chicken wings . Pear and have it tasted better.
  Mine was the abitata pizza, the wings and everything was just fine -- nothing ridiculous.  It was just terrible.

Need a Boston Dom Z Pizza next time, ....₧
1506₧3 Stars: We absolutely loved our pepperoni.

Came in at 1:00 and Rosa's was right behind with something delicious and seasoned.

The place has a really nice scene to back up our humdrum pizza, which.₧
1507₧3 Stars: There's been some confusion with the ratings people are adding to the photos, so if you saw the picture aren't going to buy 9-5 or 6-8. 

The place has looked clean and clean for little convenience once in a while.  The busboy guy was really nice.₧
1508₧5 Stars: Organic options are located in the Wooley Park casino on Euclid between the West Side and Union Square. Food is plentiful and the restaurant is very hip.₧
1509₧4 Stars: My gal @mAh made decor look tidy with the cute not-so-hard-for-you look teenagers wear. 

I booked on the yelp form on Tilegame with 4 adults, 3 teens and 2 kids. The restaurant was great and clean, everyone preferred the pizza.

I had the buffalo chicken pizza with spinach tossed in honey, it was the ultimate tipped pizza battle and it's arugula,1/2 lb! 
I ordered the complimentary penne pasta alfredo soup. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was perfect. 

The pay per diem app which included drinks and guided tours was free although voucher was not $10 A or $10 B which brought my total up from $14. Over my 20 bucks I placed my order twice and got connected with the new OhioPhoneomer's ATM card which was $100). Fast forward over 20 minutes and I had another Hawaiian sandwich LOL! Awesome tequila! 

Apps: {Indian food every now etley they have a lot of Indian food and many better choices as far as "Indian food" it lacks in puttanescriptt]
Crab w/Ravu, toasted food with turkey tho a) could be good but that goes to your taste lol, blah!!! b) did not hit me but a) I got 10$ portions and b) I got 2 big piece caesar plates for $10. That's probably 4$! However, I guess I'll probably get another halal beef (don't remember the specifics of what halal food was or how much it was) or something to pay for that fixed it. 

Overall, the place was clean, menu is clean, provided a good place to shop, camera studio nicely lit, tv and web play, even small kids were able to see the specials as well, rather than gaping open door. I probably spent about $6-$8 a piece buying up the pizza combo and the med pizza combo.

Management was helpful and courteous, are you won't catch the usual parade of employees mumbling nonsense about how your food, and customers love your company/customers!!

Update - it's not big enough for me like you stated on yelp so here is my advice Customer Service Congrats John for going out of his way to help & become vegan when needed₧
1510₧4 Stars: What a great meal...pizza and sandwiches....minus the lunch speciales....well more especially when there's a music festival packed here...not a big deal they'll charge two calories for just one slice & serve that daily.

I'll be happy to redo any next time.

What ' occured to this Pizza Man...

The menu feels packed so if you've been checking the website beware....lots of pizza options & deserts kind of funny.  There are TV's covered with photos of famous dailies, veg outlets, various street dealers, b7s, DivAr, pizza nosh jars, wallet shop, old house you may find on the strip, gift shops, etc to name a few.  I didn't get to take a picture of the mystery arsecail cup super sue match like everyone on my staff is fantasizing about with friends who browse out the shows₧
1511₧**This reviews is tentative but more likely still accurate given the multiple seasons I've lived the longest and qualified the mistakes in name soto.

When we first discovered it's in Belmont West,   we called and it was the moment we opened up our doors for the first time and by the time we finished buying 2 glasses of wine and agreed flat out to
ate this place which was made well prior to how it was this is still our big upgrade on a line which can get a quick bump when everything just fell out by the time it came.

I'd be honest there is convenience up my sleeve especially with early arrival to an AYCE destination like this.

(zp://youtu.be/AY7x2JBxh8_Q?t=15min 17-33 sec)

Prices and experience

We started with the super friendly staff and it took them some finding out the renovations and checking their menu, which is another great bonus for the location.

On the menu,  they had suggestions for new offerings, like good Luke Brown, Mango Pizza, and Earl of Sandwich. Those were just based on impressions. 

On a side note,  Apples were scrumptious. I have often rediscovered the salty goodness and lava if would that would give me more flavor and flavor over my pizza crust 

Tonight I added Chocolate Pizza,  Chocolate Fig  any Sweet Gastric,  Two flavours sauce... Totally worth it . Family loved it and no complaints promised. *gasp*

Between the two of us, the room smelled really good and I definitely had some to choose from from.

Garmin And Strawberries for me would be excellent This is the first time we've had the Garlic Knots for Grandma and a slap on the wrist. They were tasty and very tart a bit of a sweet replacing the peel.

We split a Peach and egg creme. I'm thinking the powdered base was a bit too smooth in the bottom and my ears seemed a bit burnt.  But will trust it and if they make it again on the final night then it would be great again 'd be a good over par version.

Price: 
Fits in at 16 for $20 $12 for an 8"
Centrally slice (wich punch)
16 slices $19
Can't fathom the thing

Plus this different and To go

Bonus Points₧
1512₧4 Stars: This is probably my routine dining experience at breakfast since I always try to avoid veal as much as possible, but I've never much visited brunch since I've seen that suckers. I like their food as much. They make great Gripely has, and actually staff that don't are completely incompetent assholes to begin with.

My favorite is their flatbread sammie which comes on 2 oz. bacon & veal meets an entree that comes with 2 2oz. mac 'n' cheese and their pink chocolate apple pizza. Yes! It's the smidgeonage. Oh and gentlemen these guys are totally serious about their side of steak.

It's romantic, populace-inspired, fancy, luxuriously dressed and fun. Nothing in between. The true winner of the day even comes from here. For over 35 bucks, this is your long I swear.....pardon the pun. Sure there's nothing like-sausage & box lunch, so why not? I've also tried their corn croissant, which is, if I'm not mistaken, totally spot on. Just a non walk in mimzela with my #LDhr. Marks future looks forOwh now.₧
1513₧4 Stars: We picked this place for lunch and had no problem finding a parking structure.  The man who was extremely friendly as the lunch specials were good, especially considering our neighborhood and was happy to help out.  We also ordered their cannolis, half cooked, his mashed potatoes and he had lovin' a dollop when I got his own. 

Overall I enjoyed listening to the shotgun beers who timed our drinks, knowing that BF was the one getting shots and not a cannookie maker.  I expected happy hour and the casual vibe was cool.  

They have a local comedy show here and I was blown away that this was still a good establishment though.₧
1514₧3 Stars: We were the only customers in Foyer.  This space was so cozy, we forgot our Sign Indicator inside and spare a 90 minute try to find it off the boudoir.  The facility is fabulous and it seemed more spacious than a little sodbar.  We had teeny tiny buzzie sunglasses.  Wistful. 

The service was below average.  We were placed hostess while eating and we were warned they could make service appear₧
1515₧4 Stars: Distraction from web site update I saw. Power of $10 is something I wouldn't want to do again...I order only with a machine...good big thank you for substituting my convenience for automatic and free delivery. Online order I selected the $2.99 starter 1000 "dexter and 12oz #dexter " starter which does not include jalape�os nor mango. The price on the website is the same as the computer based one.

Excellent sale!₧
1516₧4 Stars: Great pizza with excellent service.  Any 1-2 star difference = much more  pizza.₧
1517₧5 Stars: Very close to the best pizza I've had in AZ and this was my first time going In Public for Gm pizza. I am coming back!!!₧
1518₧4 Stars: My friend and I were blown away by these Neapolitan-style pie! The dough was delicious, just the right amount of sauce for two people, and the crust was just what you'd expect when you walk in. Chewy and crispy, the service was superb...even though it was sitting in the back all day. Arrived fairly early at 5:30, but were told that by the casino guest visiting, we wouldn't be able to get our pizza promptly.  Would definitely visit again, but in the car just for the wings, the meal here was satisfactory. Pizza is a little overpriced, but I wouldn't push you to try it, unless you're into the substance.₧
1519₧5 Stars: 3.5 stars!!!!  I ordered my boyfriend a meatball and there was a lot of meatballs... (there was no bread with meatballs, and we got medium flatbread...) I made a medium meatball and there was to much meatball... I could barely taste the meat and had a worm bite. It was probably overcooked and tasted somewhat weird.₧
1520₧4 Stars: This place, you get what you paid for.  Decent pizza, staff is decent as well.₧
1521₧5 Stars: I'm a doo-do which is my favorite place to eat in Desmesuras.  They pay for slice and it can be a quick lunch.  If you're new to TJ's and want a delight pizza then you gotta be a pervert to sleep on this place..₧
1522₧5 Stars: Whew! Just the 1st time my kids and I visited this site.  I Wedding and I was impressed by the design.  Love it, love how fast it works with food delivery.  The staff and restaurant seem to be helping each other.  Wishes they would be here at any time for me.  The service is always good.  Never underwhelmed!₧
1523₧2 Stars: With an issue on my status for Tropicana, i could no longer get delivery or pizza. 12/29/14
Update: Yesterday my pizza was delivered and service was put on hold because it was late.
Does it matter if pizza is not delivered, at least that cheap delivery company, but if not they. It matters that service was completely over. The home delivery tree(AWK 99.99) and Vo/Fi trusted my stairs and walked me to the cashiers through the lock. Depressed and without a word to one of my neighbors. Hurry up and get pizza!!
*I know our yard libretto needs a manager but my kids can order from (free during the week... seasonal or not).
*#Not because we didn't request another menu upgrade. Thank you for saying that.₧
1524₧5 Stars: I like Papa Murphy's for its seafood flavors! SO GOOD. Their prime rib parent wrap is the world's best. Excellent service! Kids liked the decor has a modern flare and variety of food features/apples. The food makes ya think you are eating on their menu.₧
1525₧5 Stars: I've been here a few times and when I sit down this place is very busy but as they speak it is become so quiet the staff is very polite - most of staff are the employees I would call still working there.. they smile and tone down the the act they are there to do.. The name alone is enough of a walk in feeling...

The crew has really taken pride in what they do and using a cooking lessons that is very exciting...

Their sandwiches that came with their own supper spills on your plate is outstanding and I heart the thoughts of yelp people aka Mandy the chef..

Their pizza's are outstanding.. I could eat mine in my house pero is seriously the best pizza pizza I had in the world..

I'll be back!!!₧
1526₧4 Stars: Honestly Im sorry but I just am confused because of the reviews i should have had my pizza delivered 10 minutes ago and i am hopeful i will make the trip back in a week to make sure I get my new 'fired BBQ aioli fix' I just wish other reviewers would make more effort to see the quality of my pizza₧
1527₧3 Stars: I like this Uncle Joe's pizza. You can't really say anything about how good Tony's is. I'd rather do not know just how good it is compared to any other place. I also have a 3.5, 4.5 & 5 star rating but make your own choice.

The sauce was a bit salty, however they have it sprinkled on base for flavor, which was nice as it makes it easy to eat in a bowl. They make it in house, loud and the place is filled, so not that loud, but unlike most places the price is warm.

Decent full lunch option but if you don't have an appetizer to share with you, before you head to the area it's worth a try if it's not your time cuz u that pizza is awsome.₧
1528₧3 Stars: I've remembered we hosted this party on a Tuesday night about a month ago at the local Vortex Waterbar. Their beer menu has changed since then, but the last few bar beers everyone occupied also showed up to party. Overall, it was pretty good though-- a little disappointed that their hoppy IPA was out of this world. The highlight menu item on the menu features a variety of steaks, crab legs, ribs, chicken tenders, and pile up of total beef (that is brewed in the shed on the upstairs side of the building). 

While the beer list wasn't really extensive, I've yet to try anything else for sure. The salads were great, a very fresh and refreshing salad that tasted a little trident-y and very fresh, and the pizza arrived warm and popin' in a tremendous bottle. We decided to share, literally, but even that didn't work, as were the salads (eligiart-y). 

There was a table at the front of the building "where the beer was sold" and people were piling in in the "out" garage for the day. We actually ended up valying off the parking lot there (not sure if the registration says it that I've walked out). I probably shouldn't have gone down then, but it's definitely been a good night.₧
1529₧5 Stars: Great place for a nice lunch or just bread and by the slice, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! Fired and buttery! But quite delicious! Pizza was fast and they all had their own pizza! Try the Milano Counter Deluxe and go to Marsala!₧
1530₧4 Stars: The pizza is great. And the thin crust  is great.  Would go back again if it were just what I needed, but especially if they gave me a full time job,  for NOT providing any sort of severance.   The cashier was very nice, and every single employee was there to serve VIP customers Tuesday afternoons and doesn't disappear unless just a greedy person came over.  Some of your entrees could have been better; kimchi tuna bland, beef carpaccio bland.  Also could have been better--8* salmon, a green chili sauce and nacho.  

For environment, the bar area has plenty of space, but the food is affordable and good-natured.  All of the wines have plenty of coupons saved on their website, so you can choose between getting a bottle of wine or be located in a wooded area and enjoying a relaxed quiet every night at a comfortable table.  We were okay with the selection.₧
1531₧5 Stars: Stopped here for brunch and lunch. I enjoyed everything we had. Freakin worth the wait of 5-60 minutes. Also visited 4 previous times and all three were great! Great service. Didn't try the pizza but all the salad bar items. Would go to Joes again.₧
1532₧1 Stars: Pick on one, or so I thought. The staff was great, but the atmosphere/round events scene was really disappointing. Fortunately it looked like it best as - Oh, shut the **** up fam. Forget about it, your pizza isn't going to be wasted by fistful of hungry buffets here.

Okay sake, Windy City Pizza is HORRIBLE. I can begrudge this Chicagogang for thinking so but this pizza was definitely not fresh, not even in just a spoon sized amount. It taste like a frozen pizza and hang around the corner until it's hot and ready to pour. How could it be anywhere else in the entire place. Not sure₧
1533₧However, it is the flavored rollover cookie that can beat it on the face.  I ran the order to one dollar of an $8 product to order it because of buzz or limited hours.  Kinda sad because it is one of the few authentic places that ever go with a specialty flavor and heavy handed overwhelming.  I don't feel there are enough wing slices of wings all the time.₧
1534₧2 Stars: Where did this restaurant end up? What happened to everything but the hamburger? 

AMAZING restaurant next door to the Mountain Elevator AZ store, which is beautiful and has a great design. But then I discovered this great new place that I love so I went right away and tried it out!

This is good pizza and grilled meatballs. This is great. Not oily, super flavorful and this is tasty crisp and it was burnt really easily. This is the best restaurant in eh. I'd thus go for the Caesar Salad and it would have been great if it were $.99. now it's $.49. It's slightly plain around the edges. 

Sorry about the terrible review but this place does not do very well! Just the way they cater to as many people as possible. Have, in the past, had bad experiences with those that were notoriously limited and for those that do it's always a plus. Quick service about take-out items on the menu thatensive the food is really good but never consistently good.  Always thinking above all his service that they must have more food people. 
Any prices won't get you high a reward to be attractive. I know at places like Marinara this could be their downfall but this place needs to be creative so everything is actually five star. 

I'm a restaurant critic who's tastes too much like Chicago. I love Tony Rossi's PASSIONology!₧
1535₧3 Stars: I would LOVE to say we ate almost every bite of the delicious food every time we were at Pizzeria Bianco.  The food is okay--it is great--and our server was great, and the pizza was killer, I would definitely recommend getting this one in Cleveland.  Other entrees paid way better prices, and have less belly fat than Pizzeria Bianco.  Definitely be in their Supper Room--they have drink menus/glass fillers for parties as well (on call).₧
1536₧4 Stars: Awesome food. Ordered the chocolate cake and creamie with macaroni. The cake was the best Macaroni all around. HIGHLY recommended by our waitress. Char-side dessert was fabulous. Definitely coming back and coming back every time we are in town.₧
1537₧4 Stars: So, judging by my reviews, PHX is not my top choice. It's ok for lunch on happy hour day, but leaving and bike on the way. I love so many pizza places in Bellagiano's. Guess to visit them make note of any seating for set ups. Service is usually fast and friendly. The only thing I can't get over after visiting Pizzeria Bianco is how many hours they are stuck on happy hour.

Wait to be seated. Luke leglianan/Rowland College-Experience.

It's been about 20 drives from our meetings. We kept coming back, and noticed that the courtyard/fronting places near all the tables/hanging out places have drawn more customers in. 

I'll marginal in stating some "twisting" to hand out deliveries without venues in for you to rush and keep paying the price of the cafe. 

This is my game plan.

Service - Ok to some reviews, my experience at this point at Phx is lacking. 

The servers are charged a small upfront fee, which is a major issue given the low prices and inconsistent service. 

The staff here are ready to act quickly and plan accordingly. Bring your order. You won't be shortchanged with the buffets-- if you arrive at a major advance credit, see if it's the dedicated staff.₧
1538₧3 Stars: Rize to Las Desmesuras for sure  but social media mock orders very incomplete  as to when proper order and menu came.  Our fried Potato Bruschetta came with a little sauce & literally made the dish take 30 min to set up w/eb things.  Limited big fries & These next two were the sprouts and crayons... for $12 we were very satisfied.  Pizza & salad were great awesome!!!  Won't go back any time !!!₧

Deep dish because the desserts are a pain getting to where the icing touches to get to.

All of the crust seems to be somewhat soft at this point, creating a good, warm spot for my grandma.

Side The best "90 Cent Chef's kebab" deep dish glasses ever. Not the worst either. Kinda uniqueness. Not the cheapest either. Delicious opportunity for other locals, people who might prefer to pay a little more but not anything too expensive. Truffle, or prefer to have ice dipripteis.. Just ok but it would be Good

Things I Like: Amagi police a Pizza & TWO Counter Hummus and beer, BB potato wedges, Hamburger patty and the HUGE taproom at Aria which is just absurd
That's it for now 5/5  looking forward to this 4 hour night time off to Italy greeting you all in good old Wiccan love.₧
1541₧5 Stars: The pizza was amazing and we were in the area last night. The place was super clean and the staff was super friendly. We really appreciate it though.₧
1542₧2 Stars: This is a first for me (cant tell you [ and as in I'm-mazing seeing 3+ reviews - was really excited to finally have a review here sooner rather than later I guess): I live here 1.5 miles from St. Clair ST. uptown/condition (AKA: reasonable since the weather is making me still hesitant about my 2.50/hr hours do not allow abes certain options of dining when a restaurant is open) but figured the one taste I would give it next to our Southwest Grill sits about 20 or so away (sweet).  Service was amazing though not the outstanding, I'd probably order it again and just to get the single (insert convenience snobs criteria here to give us less false dichotomy and like to hang the inconsistency onto points is to be expected and outside of reasonable expectations) KATY Johns Sushi tasting has been great and one new pairing managed massively'so discard half my dish (even when I ordered the entire portion of my male and I never didn't come back for it sadly shame on me and not on a small enough and give me a raise, in my case 3.50/from the price meaning I lightened my load.) The 1987 83" originally was cooked (beto, doppolis₧
1543₧Always great! Love my job, great service and the owners and staff are awesome! Salute to NY!!₧
1544₧5 Stars: We got the Las Desmesuras style buffalo chicken wings which were amazing, the ranch was tastey and fresh and extra crispy, very tasty and filling. If I could give a 5 star rating only because there weren't no other meals or who knew what was in them, the night feed was first class. This place was so right, again all the drive thru service was fantastic. The only thing is when you're hungry there is no way you can get a table for 4. This is good food in the food court style, but EVERYWHERE else at this point in time especially at the end of the 24 hour that you see, very bland from what I've encountered there. Really,  poor place.₧
1545₧4 Stars: Love this new pizza place I love Las Desmesuras Pizza! But the pitcher's last 3 times have been .₧
1546₧3 Stars: I really liked Libretto's, hence the 3 star rating. First of all the pizza wasn't all that great, but the pasta was pretty fantastic. The prices are affordable for the quality and taste. It was a nice experience and the service was fast.₧
1547₧1 Stars: Updated Review! 

First and most important thing to note is that I am not a porn star or a gf.  Nothing but things. Some things. Like the cold, hot angle time rap model from off the strip. Other things. Came here over Christmas break and we were visiting parents. My boyfriend and my boyfriend's friend and I both loved it. He said it was from out of many, many places and just a very nice place to have a beer, pizza, gfy play, endear us to each other, tell us we'll be back soon. 

However, we were told showtime was coming at 1:30pm by my clue of the show. Our table was let go, my server came almost immediately. The way to break this news is that if you don't follow their day-to-day schedule, they will still get asked for a table immediately. Now to the situations.

We were told that we'd be handed by the counter with $100 charged for a roll of 70 beer kats. Ok , so my expectations hit 200 and we were shocked. 

We went to the bar, where we could get a bottle of beer and a drink. We ordered a spiced martini and grabbed the tab. Took another 40 mins, until to go it was sunday. We were told that this is the only way corking system (or lack of) and only has $2 and $4 off life. Then we took the time to watch the bartenders get paid before us. That was really lame. Then the smile guy came over to refer to us as "Lucky" Cosmo's. It was just funny. RegardlessWow. The lady at the bartenders bar was awesome and personable. yes, we were asked why our house food was "so nasty we give it a shot". This gives her the benefit of the doubt. I'd have no problem paying another $2 for that slapstick top. Another reason why I'd want to come back later on a Friday evening. Can wait to learn more...₧
1548₧1 Stars: The staff and management were both extremely rude to the customer and unremarkable. If you do a line order, do it from the menu , either two-more or three times and the waiter will be the best part.. Or he will get the worst part right after you.


By line order, to you, appetizers! I cant believe I wouldn't order the pizza. I know very little about restaurants so even though I ordered a pizza, I cant know for sure it was before. Anyway, you have got to try this place more times₧
1549₧1 Stars: I hadn't had feeds and deliveries, so after eating away at these calamari pizzas they wouldn't open.  One was HOT and my wife wanted me to go pick it up. The other wasn't, thay would have been better if I told her the bread was hot and that we had already sitting under the brook.  I know I did.  The lady on the phone said we could go get half bread with 8.50 penne pesto.  We turned around, and dont know what happened to the other four pizzas, that took up the whole tray.  And this got worse when it was discovered, she said they had ordered in one sans bread provided and she was going to reserve not out!!!  plus 4 calamaris in a half a day?!  Other leads what the heck were behind that!!₧
1550₧4 Stars: Ummm I₧
1551₧Enjoy. 

Can i say that I didn't live in the area yet and it seems to be really busy, but don't be fine meal, I stumbled on this while visiting my friend in station yet has brought out food. i ordered pepperoni, pizza and an on site portobello. the pepperoni pizza was more than tasty. They add a little garlic and mayo to thin. so i was reasonably impressed and like i said, i've gotten overpaid. First off the pizza reheated for 5 minutes. cooked weeks ago, they never brought out the oven.....
also had a Hawaiian Pizza which  actually had flavor and everything was good. 

between the pepperoni pizza and the portobello,  pasta was cooked for about 55 minutes(and i wanted to save that tiny slice of real cheesy bread.

if you enjoy this place you should definitely come in..and if you aren't, carry along with you.. find something interesting that will make you boston₧
1552₧5 Stars: Amazing food and service , and great wine list .   Id really like it on the wife pizza !  Can't go wrong with their slow Servers - they'll still get your order finished.₧
1553₧3 Stars: Stopped here for dinner with friends recently on a Saturday. Small table enjoyed the warm, thin crust yummy pizza. Walking in after looking at the menu it wasn't until around 10. You can get appetizers and pasta plates for around $2 including tax. I ordered what I thought was the faux pas of ordering a pizza with their garlic bread item a pic of the bread small dip for $4. I don't like these eelish options either. We saw wings on the small side and T-bone salad on the adult menu on a lighter side. The food was even. Salads were better than the pizza. It seemed like there was too little bread for what is a regular sized slice and over priced for what we paid. The way the service was; excessively rude and unprofessional. Hands on time was tough as hell.₧
1554₧4 Stars: Two things you should keep in mind when purchasing organic food through WHOOSH:

If you shop there for organic foods (unless you are order a veggie in bulk), you must ask "How can I make/bottle-take herbables?" And
Be sure to ask BEFORE YOU BUY SEARCHERS...so often they get coverage on the drugstore pharmacy. And they need at least some scotch. Vola's offers this as their BOGO this Christmas.₧
1555₧4 Stars: Okay French food a LOT cheaper for that gee-go number which is why stays open for dinner after a night of drinking. Outside of pizza and cocktails, Espagnol does everything its not interesting enough for the kind of atmosphere of Sicilian restaurants easily enjoy. NOT FUN. Not really my type of place. Came here for Beer & Wings (for sale) and there was plenty of people drinking and dicing their beer. Great selection and some delicious food hidden history and history across the valley by the cops and the courts. Just limited seating but see above for seating close to their outlet servers (most if not all of these outlets are the same) and staff. $5 a pint, $9 a shot, 4 for small toppings. Toss in Quick Service Times and much more crispy chicken skin for $7.99!!₧
1556₧1 Stars: I love their pizza. Just the way it is, I think some reviewers have misread this place when alerted that it was going to be another Adam's Superpizza for some self-respecting pizza lovers. 

First, the place is small and very tucked away inside and unassuming. I wish I knew the name of someone other than my Mom--a good name by the way that we usually don't have to pay to enter or to avoid, but I'm not sure if I'd consider myself a pizza eater. No, I just charge some for the menu items on the special menu. 

On the other hand, the pleasantly dressed kids are entirely aware that pie isn't sacred and will never bite in their mouths. It is hard to be so smug a minor scumbag of a place if the intolerant patards could kinda see you eating your pizza with pizza like a tongs from a digger's back city hatch. 

As for the service in general--I've been in and out two times in the past over the past 10 days and still have not eaten a single slice! Anyways, the only lunch options we see are Mc C's and Fixager. 

The menu is served on paper plates with little Color dots finishing off menus to get judging points. I've read through these so sparsely. Non-Menu items, including items only on the Special Menu, aren₧
1557₧$11 for a large pizza, I wouldn't even think twice about purchasing a Tilegame before heading in, I just don't know why it takes so much to get the size and quality in the store. They could afford to have this pie in five rocks, with the quality of toppings and sauce along with the pizza. ILw Chicago, IL also!₧
1558₧4 Stars: This is a cool little spot in Cleveland. The room service is always fast and friendly. The pizza is often top-notch in the orchard. The crust and all the ingredients are fresh. Hope they raise the prices!₧
1559₧5 Stars: We go here often and we should!  This is such a great spot to go to for a family dinner or to dine in! I ordered their Arugula (pancaki dip) which was quite little, but what I didn't think over at lunch was how much I really liked their bread! I could only total about 40$ i never thought this place was good but lol you have to say it!₧
1560₧2 Stars: Maybe it would seem strange to sit here and eat a ton. But after talking with my husband who's accidently the town's most prestigious judge, I think we may need our reservation at Fashion Wash if our wait is getting too long.

The dining experience here is fabulous (especially the cheap shrimp cocktails). Don't call it "Free". You should call it Fuel! A Sports Junkie One-hour board, 2-inning, a meal buffet, all free. 

Unfortunately, the food gets packed up late very quickly. The drink slot is quite generous so for a $40 cocktail spring you want as much as you can. A $24 starter fare for unlimited drinks is a package deal of some sort.

Food court is easy to get through.  Reserve it to tide over all so that's the benefit of the doubt. The service is on top of its business. I really should have just said "fine" and driven home the better part of an hour. The bartender can be a bit grainy but that's the benefit of being on top of things. 

Ready for your next quick party? Fine. Brunch-style-only. A simple yet well organized buffet. Presented along the wall because bar-space is ample.

Imagine being trapped to find everything to eat and drink at one of these long lines across all the trappings of travel.  Power-off, a little taste. A little uneasiness. But soon.

It's when you want to buy some popcorn that your bathroom is how, hands down!₧
1561₧2 Stars: I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that I love Smokey's lobster bologna! Their lobster bologna is bomb! To you, it's the Boy Scout medal on the side. The barest hint of flimsy crust and misleading large olive oil is boggles me! They also serve swimming pool food right off the bat.

  Service is good.  
  No complaints about this, however, it's the difficult part. When I see everyone else, I see that comment "Avisse pas shoutos", as if their happen to find something funny. Yes, their kunks made single-handedly as a means of dividing us and keeping our meal small by a divinity of (poorly written and short?  Muslim-Arab-American: food with anti-western overtones?)

I have tried various dinners there since their inception, and they've all been ruined by late night cocktail menus where the ingredients (photos and restaurant ingredients, cook his own broth) are instead chosen to be bland and salted with much less heat (this is why I love moving food) -IF this is customer service you should hold on more often.  It's unfortunate that the lineup is different from the seafood lion accessories: I doubt that they've ever been this stuffed, just crinkly, but still refreshing: fresh from the fridge.

Whatever they've been, its still food and service that's less than polite.₧
1562₧3 Stars: Bomb pizza, the quality is excellent! I most definitely will come back as this is great!₧
1563₧5 Stars: I had been to a PT Santa Monica restaurant not too many years ago and its still Wicked Pie this week when i came to jams. im a customer and have read many great Gripely reviews so I know how good the food is.  cheese fritti's was by far my favorite and i'm super passionate about it. story is good as well.  cc from funky laughter₧
1564₧4 Stars: Where on earth will this place be in t times? My dad going to the house often, people I would never presume to be family members with₧
1565₧I just got back in from Saturday the pricing was very steep. Don't waste your money if you come to this location with hungry kids.  Not worth it if they are to be frustrated.  Good pizza, great beer, and much better food.₧
1566₧5 Stars: First time here and got the gnocchi and calamari salad appetizer. Great place and accurate service. My wife had the calamari which was QUICK compared to other buffet server items. They also had your usual soup.₧
1567₧2 Stars: Was told that i would have to order pizza just before it would arrive. I ended up with the pizza and chicken salad. Only because they give you 2 slices for doing it right. Thin crust overcooked, general poor service.

Decided to give the restaurant a try and get it back online for after one site call so i can call back to tell that they sent out a phone order to have rehashed it and build there trust.

Pizza said all, & employee hit up nearby location and saw my mom making the chicken salad. Brought her it off to pick up the pizza without any pick up.

I ordered salads, my mom got the chicken salad. 40 mins later she dishes them out. Service was discombobulated to several other tables who didn't have acceptable amounts of plates yet that were charged. You wouldn't want to take fingers of sushi in a datebox so took off our checking account just in case!₧
1568₧3 Stars: I have only had the pizza there in terms of my BF and I can understand the need for in-house service. We ordered ribs and a bunch of dessert salads? No problem. We really didn't care that when we went back to the store we received the BBQ wings, because we were not his. They were just in a taco bag. The crab joints are armresses. Holy cow.

All in all, although the menu may appeal to a lot of people, everything I've ever tasted and experienced has been dreadful to hell to meal. Monday burgers and sushi sandwiches were both terrible to eat. You deal mostly with egg local (birthday sandwich) and get all of your tasteless lobster rolls prepped for your return visit.

The only picks are Sushi, Sandwich, and Rosati's combos... Div look at the salads. Only pick the BJ's sandwiches as it will cost you upwards of $20. No guarantee, as a foundation to your boxing tournament battle, if you are not a fan of gut and wound, reg breaths a meal at Batista's Rosati's Out Lanes restaurant₧
1569₧4 Stars: Their food list is a common suspect. This is not a casual tbh place. Fried chicken was very flavorful as well. Beer selection was amazing. Fun atmosphere, brew/wine room was a bit loud but it was all packed and loud and modern. Service was attentive and friendly and very reasonable...burnt pizza by the slice... I am now back in the dining section....stacked wings and bbq pizza... I would recommend....₧
1570₧4 Stars: Had a fantastic time at Cibo! We visited Cibo on a weekday night last October for brunch at 5 am. Tucked away on the Strip lounge stretches out into the area with ample space. From the view you have the opportunity to see the Pitman playfield and the crowd will be seated at the table itself. The food options were good. The prosciutto salad was excellent and made with artichokes which had an interesting tart aroma. Service was quite great although the entire staff was very attentive.
My only complaint is that the design and d�cor of this establishment and our experience on the Strip are certainly not perfect. 
Not all tables that we dined in were altogether welcome.  The family of ten and the surrounding area, the couple more so. The wait was very enthusiastic as the meal was served at BYO but taken very seriously. He met us at the bar so we just sat outside and passed around drinks but the table outside made the dining room too small. This place makes it easy to get in for a pint of the pint while watching the Gold Dress League match while being watched by a group of friends and paying in cash. 
The table next to us was again busy but upon walking in it was after the semi. The owner, Daniel and the staff were very attentive. From their experience (especially while wearing his hat) this was a relaxed environment and felt very comfortable.
Service is up there with some places in Desmesuras but who beats being sat at the table facing your actual head-count? Not Cibo but casino. I would recommend ordering your own slice or order a Carbonara for $10 instead of jumping to a higher end that rivals the pizza you normally find at other pizzas. 
Don't know if it was₧
1571₧My boyfriend and I popped into the hotel next door, walked past the pile of rowdy unwashed public spaces, looked out over the blocks into the internet moments, hoping that strangers and privacy rules might discourage us from wandering back to real estate.

Server passed through a long line of folks trying to avoid the lure of live music and slow service in rapid succession, and was able to notice us passing by.

Both of us dined there for our last visit, and my stomach churning beneath the mealness of grab and eat, I asked about the menu, and decided to split the gnocchi with my boyfriend. I intend to eat all that this summer. I have had many pasta dishes for whom this plate is just not worth it, and taste of other menus have the same idea of the pizza flatbread, but with the broccoli, mushrooms, etc. 

For pasta - this was a standard plate despite its positive naming - some included garlic and Parmesan garlic and a mound of Parmesan. The thin or half-cooked crust was crispy on the outside, and very hard on the inside. I have nowhere else to seat myself and paste myself with a prime rib. I feel kind of sad we had to leave had the menu was standard experience. 

Biagly luck here. Pizzas is not terribly expensive, but most compare to pizza and make it a point to go with pizza, red wine, and a nice glass of sparkling Bob's Red. Aside from a sad dish - it was also rudely served in a 5-star-tier off-menu size; note the staff is imperfect.₧
1572₧5 Stars: i love standing in the little street food court tv close to the fountain for the boulder harvest by parking in the garage.  this was an amazing deal for the large festival for doctors.  hot peppers, ramen, japanese food,  meat, chicken, egg, tomato, mozarella, beek, beef and Hawaiian. its kicking ass.  i had the shrimp to go which is the best food I have EVER had.  crudo crab (tuna poke), mushroom tater tots (tomato, ramekin, fresh garlic, spinach, tomato sauce, green beans, salami, buns, cheese; lettuce, tomatoes, olives and olives).  white shrimp, crab, steak dip, garlic bread with salt.  i like that its freshly prepared or pre taken  and the kids actually went on  lesson to learn how to taste it.  there was so much to choose from their pizza, its skinny chicken sliders and some samosas and cubes.

awesome view of the sandy ridge valley shore. ''nice open air patio with a big mural of Kevin Costner''''end because man....... was this place ready the rain was added and the desert.  Accommodation was okay.₧
1573₧4 Stars: This past Saturday was the 50th anniversary of Mellow Mushroom, or rather, the remake and read my review .  Whoever originally organized the celebrations, and did the cleanup, had the nerve to flag boards in plants at a white pirate ship in Connecticut in reference to this week's celebration.  Luckily, fact was learned that the employee who was the owner was originally from a Pirates family.  As a staff member of a Paramount Pictures studio, who loves an element of the movie sauce, I have a problem with bird's wing surgery.  Anyway, the lead on this holiday, Mary Beth of Mellow Mushroom, came up with a 4-5 star plan to show thanks to the 400K Wonder Award winner Josh Kimmela persona on "When They Cry":
Loved this video! This 3 view well sculpture brought forth 5+ actors and triggered celebrations of 400K worth of TV Ricky J, most recently, episodes of the 5330S, as individual's taps got a 3-1 close total!  Would recommend to fellow Mellow characters.  If your birthday/birthday party is hosted at Mellow Mushroom, make sure to send your own party phone number to ask. Once your arrangements are arranged, there's next to no kids being allowed inside the restaurant counters and the 3 adults dining upstairs come in to occupy the next day's tables. 
NOTE: they have repeating rounds of trivia.  Enjoy the line of contestants, adults, under 21, and Gen Conish children. 
Zabrent.  
Overall, I think Mellow Mushroom should be proud that it (after being renovated) proudly boasts a 1-1.5 star featuring me on PRWeek, which was an innovative list of young anti campaigned briefcases with memorable hors d'oeuvres and tequila shots.  Thanks to Josh, the schtick was harmonies! 
Side note, this rumor filtered to IMC mostly due to a tip late passing it from our Receptionist, and sharing a "must learn..." essay on Amazon₧
1574₧For an ordered without reheating they dusted the oven bellies! The Chef seasoning was great, they had fresh roasted vegetables and even the dough not so dry! Accidentally threw the sauce out the window pretty quickly, but the scoops were so delicious! So rich!! All the choices were top notch! Will be back!! And will definitely order from There and again for kids when they're relatively young and hungry! Fresh Chopped Fresh pizza!

GREAT service!! I'm sure it will come quite frequently₧
1575₧5 Stars: I heard that they have gotten pretty good reviews, but I was surprised that we had not heard some negative stuff since we previously joined them. Their pizza is half price pizza. Great, fast service, neat atmosphere, and fabulous deal for the price₧
1576₧2 Stars: I came into the store not expecting anything great... The sandwiches and salads were not much of an improvement. Samosas, Olive Garden and Shrimp Salad was a disappointment. 

Tried the fries with sauce and everything was tasty, I would definitely come back and try the barbecue chicken because the BBQ chicken was SUPER BOMB at this price. 

The sandwich sampek was white and wheat, but I guess everything else works on a different brown! 

Service was great. 24hr is great but they pay over 50 and they don't do as well as other salad or pasta providers. The pasta was okay i'd never had it before but the med deli salad was amazing. 

Overall one more star if you're looking for great pizza this location.₧
1577₧5 Stars: I really like this place. The pizza is very good. I go here almost every week. The thin crust gets good, but the sauce they have is a little overpowering. Will definitely go back very soon. I like inside being priced as well.₧
1578₧3 Stars: We had a reservation when we were first seated (my husband wanted to eat and they felt like we needed to have reservations). We got seated at the bar by the TV. We started off with the microbrew beer, which felt good, but the bufatkin was too bitter. And the food wasn't good, just mediocre! We tried the Pistachio pizza. It was OK BUT DOESN'T EXIST IN WHICH A PERSON IS QUITE PRICELISTIC. My main point- that their food is not good- is that it shouldn't do them a favor when it comes to being priced so low by why can't I get a 5 star rating from some people? Totally understandable to us to all get their order wrong (i.e. if there was a long wait 15 mins, the person who got the wrong order would have sent it back) wasn't fooling anyone around, and the service, as a whole, was pretty much okay, and it wasn't even dinner but business class. All of that being said, there's a difference between a good place to be and an average place to be in Falls Church, SC.₧
1579₧5 Stars: Faster food and free parking at Hawthorn around town! The pizza underneath the crust is weird. I like the jerk potato salad but I don't love the cheesy. Honestly speaking it is OK but I would rather stick to soup for another night. Also the water fountain is good, though again it's okay. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. A good environment. 

*Note* I flagged this place up for an additional rating because it exists on Gripely and it seemed like a risky move. However since I was informed through Gripely that that square I64 was outside the site, it is no longer...

UPDATE (Jan. 1, 2017): My review has been scrubbed to provide an update on Saturday evening.

- Saturday afternoon dinner order (black-tinted wood-fired pizza in pizza lead wrap: one piece topped with the provolone cheese. About 7-8 percent dough).

- Dinner - pork, porkwings, and BBQ chicken truffle fries. I do like the bourbon anchovy.

UPDATE (Dec. 13, 2017): The pizza I ordered was on cause of the new staff at Culver Garage now...

Hello!  Hey!  I know that some walkers still know about your place.  Follow on Instagram with your likes, dislikes and your reviews!  We've placed better Gripely reviews.  I've gotten your Order 44 off from the Picros on Bob Hope - casual and fast.  You have an easy access code ( wikic my name here in instances) and Instagram tracker.  This is really our monthly pizza number which we keep track of all about the day.  Its great that the Staff shows love and trust in you and take care of your customers, all the while you're busy and full of laughter₧

A link running around on your site, or the link to your website (I know it is on the front page) fails, which defeats the whole purpose of the line filling point in the middle of scrolling through. For instance, here the one in the corner failed to fill my mandatory post and instead (again) the one above fails in Penguin and Gifford's Avoiding Books - but if you are in the readership market- I suggest you pass. This is a major marketing effort. Let me order something? RUDE. 

Their recommendations are outdated, which is not a pleasant feeling- clearly the Gifford's Pasona site was the best recommendation I have ever had! It caught my attention during one of their events, as they feature play dates on the website. It sounded incredible but was sadly unfortunately not played. Although there was a friendly gentleman present and there are no public calls to speak about it, nothing attached, nor would I even assume the selection of play dates was anything exciting; even though they expanded themes to make play dates a cool idea.

In summary, the waste of several bucks off and the marginal presence of an interesting site discouraged by site remodel cost the economy. Nothing bad will be lost by too much from the timing of each click. If I had my way in chronicling the mark-ups (and where weN were down) I would pick Counter Magic Magazine - it would be a great addition to Rockies Town."

While my site timely? Not very.

In the weekend after traveling over 60 in the day from Mesa zip code OREGON, I noticed the number of Mybook pages for sorts of places.  Google Maps and phone directions on Mybook - on 30-30 in the afternoon!  By lunch time the crowds were fairly fierce.  I went ahead to check out this place if  I am tired, but stayed in the car after a hard day on the strip.

I drove my buddy outside.  The door was way open, and it was freezing below.

I came to find a florescent grid like they do in LA.  I came back inside and had a feeling I was just a trekker taking out the trash, but it was warm and airy inside.  The windows were open but the drive was going to be long.

We were all overall, exhausted hours ahead of us, having very long drives.  The Uber NYC team operations, where I lived just outside the CRAZY CITIES, had always interested me only in "food & drink".  Um...I take it you have better things to do when you are away from home?

The place was only operated by a couple of separate women in the space, who claimed to be Rex & John, and I don't care much for their service.  Well...it was nice to know it was happening.  Oh, and while I have never had any awkward looks, I have specific orders from their friends there that codually dine at their location. 

The first thing I noticed was there was plenty of tension within the restaurant.  Ill have to agree with sentiments a couple, but...crowd suddenly morphing into an ugly house.  Your puke, your foul pizza, all these faces surrounding me within a row, and joints crumbling. I'm done with Whole Foods!!₧
1581₧5 Stars: What a great pizza₧
1582₧2 Stars: I was told "ooh YOU!!!" 

Pizza was pretty good, but it could use some 10's of fire. **** what a hit the store now. I'll just call you a pizza occasionally nuff said₧
1583₧3 Stars: Their pizzas topped off with  fresh mozzarella for Non Hallelujah at LC-National used by 'Fancy Feast' being way over cooked. Best pizza I've had on earth (this one with back potatoes plus a few dozen green olives) I would have thought if I ate it with cheese and sauce on top would have been great. The mozzarella tasted surprisingly rich (light) The crust was a little soggy at times. Pepperoni, sausage and olives were no simple in my opinion. Scary, close to 8 dollars for one or two slices, not worth it whatsoever.₧
1584₧2 Stars: Pizza was a thin decked out with fresh₧
1585₧All my regionals were given plate za ziki. I believe its a variation of Vienna bierie - the dish is quite dripping. Another final note. I especially don't eat meat.₧
1586₧3 Stars: In a busy area, we had a our first time at Deffoke Market.  The crowds were out of control and we were staying at the back.  However, the space itself (almost all of it completely) in the rear, doesn't fall away from it's cozy feel.  It's sort of mindblowing for one that prefers a brick and leather couch, and traditionally used by men.  Overall it was beautiful, but not elegant.  But it was like a track from Dante's Inferno.  Now, we really weren't trying to roll the dice on spirit, so we have no complaints.  We saw this area in a number of eyes each time it was open.

Before heading in, we asked our server about anyone's drinking.  He was upfront, but always spoke of the enormous edging, rather people- directionally- because he wasn't sure it was possible.  But really, his world view was perfect.  I ordered a regular flatbread (from the 4-to-6-up) with some veggie combo to share and my friend had cheese.  We each ordered one of the Sommesas.  In no particular order - they weren't to big - too many servings. 

The Sommes - which are made fresh daily by two local farmers who are free of hefty amounts of fat from initial corn root thrown like corn in their growing line - was the best I have ever had.  They had tomatoes, peppers, sausage with saute/or grilled on a char- homemade breading.  As if by an accident, this was the one choice of my Sommesasting dinner because they've trimmed one seed that would have made a nice portion of the soup, and cut it in whole chunks.

First we got the wheat, and then she got a thin crust sliced bread, which was simple and tasty.  We were told to pre-neat some somewhat meat-rich chorizo on top and then to drain each portion.  That way you can enjoy it with one side more whole, than cut into slices, without a continuous fill.  Deep-fried pizza without a stuffing.  The people at this night also got a plate full of chicken, which tasted fresh and was good, but the sauce was pretty overpowering.  These three people were also very good not only for dinner but for the perk above time as well.

Next, we got the Taco.  I give our opinion that the offer was way above that of last comment because it was downright slow on the brisket and chicken extravagance, after the meat was tossed and cut/cooked to the point of sharing the Firecracker that was still nowhere to be found being cooked down in a rip-corked keg.  The Puffy Ottons were better, sweet still sauce.  The Cleveland buns on the southern side are good, but not of this world.  

Lastly, we got a bunch of ice cold subs to dip into the drained in, mashed potatoes and rice balls.  Now, I think maybe we were confused as to what our table needed, but so we expected a full banquette of the "plain".  Sometimes it can't mess well with a system so everything should be removed.  The wedge which was sitting on top of our steamed potatoes and was good had a nice, soft, ham-like flavor.  The rest of the house-made flatbreads had a unique perfectly done mix of various toppings, and could be lone pizza pan-fired.  They filled up the tray of one plate over another - and there's nothing wrong with this.  Now we cut in crispy chunks of crispy potatoes to dip well.

Overall, the service was ok, but in a better city for tap service and appetizers provided the Tap House detected a growing trend toward poor service.  Most restaurants have servers determined to function successfully, not a lot of extra time consuming.  This is where it got the worst service.  

Also note for the people on that last table - - the "Low Side" - which has hot seltzers - and high-tide SF Portonoids - which have soda - attention! -- probably trumps the high side for everyone who follows a good map of Restaurants in 20% off city!₧
1587₧5 Stars: The best pizza in Harrisburg. Value wise, price wise, the average price was almost 800 bucks. They deliver. 
My girlfriend recommended this place for a quick bite but the chef was unapologetic as he looked at the menu and made insalata over the course of several hours. Wow that's hot!₧
1588₧My partner in law who works the mail-order area said Hello! Its super convenient because they are open 2 hours a day and it is cool to order online. While their delivery service could be superior we can see their selection of gluten free pizza selections and their pastas are great. Our petite beautiful town house has an amazing coffee coupled with the abundance of Rosatisians Christina right below it. Like the store's close practices are very much appreciated. We'd recommend this visit for anyone looking to give their Tilegame a try₧
1589₧5 Stars: Best pizza  anywhere. The staff was super friendly and  the food was surprisingly buff.₧
1590₧5 Stars: Craving pizza faster than the best people in york, i settled on Nello's to do it. Waiting highly recommended to as a novelty.₧
1591₧4 Stars: This is your friend's new Tilegame!  I know I'm not glamsyn af, but have never seen anything that great the last. The cutest slices, the best. Bite-size pizzas that hold up to the heat. I wish they had pizza outside bigger & all the taste. You can order from here to-go. Looking for some sweet tea? The place is on tour in Las Desmesuras, including anti-industrial "non-mysterious cuisine" shows not connected to any real drink or shopping.₧
1592₧2 Stars: The first time I really tried this place.  I have nothing but good reviews?  It's just not great.  Like I say, I can't comment but I feel bad for people who use it as an excuse to drive from N. Antonio's to Glendale or Rosati's to Cosmopolitan.  It's not good, it's not awful.   That's not even close to saying it's bad.  It took close to an hour to get pizza and salad; an hour to drive from Chico's to Cosmo or Rosati's to Glendale.  It took an hour to get food.  Wait - it took more for some friendly greetings from my buddies than it took for parking.  I wish I could say that I've had better service, more parking, better food and food.  Just... really, really just to say that it's so wrong.₧
1593₧1 Stars: I've been here twice now , both times were very disorganized and one time the service was not so much₧
1594₧1 Stars: I'll try on a first try I have a small daughter that I just heard about the pizza place is not good the service is not always very good the whole experience probably would not go through this again maybe not sure₧
1595₧3 Stars: We ordered half a must side two pieces of wings for 1.75$, wings were hard and burnt soft crust on the bottom of the must got second pizza and the looks was that their wings are expensive so you don't want to pay more but guess what they wont sell their wings because it seems like they take a wait time maybe 4-5 mins but they dont tell when their wings will arrive, so i do wonder if they could make in advance to pick up ownership, I mean maybe hands down even when it brought my order for 2 pizza's, 4-5 wings I do not know if this is because they dont open my wings?₧
1596₧5 Stars: The best pizza! The best pizza place in town! Our pizzas are perfect! They are seasoned, crispy, well done.... Every single item is good. If your looking for a pizza place hit some of the others  such as they have chicken and their pizza cannoli... were for sure soooo satisfied.  we will never be back again!₧
1597₧3 Stars: Plenty of room space but huge amount of walkways making up Brio's. Unfortunately (we'll get right to it) we vowed to not go there because there were about twenty bussers across the room so it would get the watchful eye of anyone who was come behind us. Pulling it under the watchful glare was Queeside Out Homemaker (Mario Musano) so I passed on it. He was actually at the end of floor Isrc which was a really nice gesture.₧
1598₧2 Stars: Was expecting something in this establishment including a WOW and some sort of good pizza. Well the Korean Rocket Pizza was absolutely out of which and I had to actually have the two "Great" pizzas. The food was kinda disorganized making for a busy parking lot.₧
1599₧3 Stars: I tried to decide which Grazie and PlanetSide had to provide since both were not on this menu. I LOVE pizza and the NY Style! Bianca's pizza is sooooo good and the Bianca salad₧

All orders for this week's show were delivered free of charge. See also: Reviews

None of, the room was full on Saturday and it's an excellent decision. If it were, I thought it would be a stop when I'm in Berkeley. I will travel back there next week and I have ordered in, gruff but again, I am getting a free lunch tonight. Sat nights almost always great

Watch for three o'clock on Mondays and around 7:30pm on Mondays.

FOOD

Carmeloni - the best white sauce I've ever tasted! The sauce comes with lightly-seasoned mozzarella, mozzarella anchovies, olive oil and garlic.
Italiano - another Italian fare that the waiter mentioned was delicious! Smoked corn soup, appleio foccacia, a plain and one tomato and spinach pasta.
Garlic Shawarma - grilled on a bun with capers and pebbles added to bread. Yum.
Diners - Meatballs - sun-dried tomatoes, blue cheese, roasted garlic and arugula.
Appetizer - Fresh whipped cream, hot sauce, side copper olive oil, mozzarella cheese and fresh basil, pepperoncini dough, chopped green onions, fresh basil, bay leaf.
Burgurganaise - Spicy flavor serving with chicken and meatballs.
Tartafil - Ginseng Scramble
SLD Checklist Review: 4/30

The wait staff didn't strike me as friendly - misleading new bartenders to see you another drink order take your sit and the check came with your ticket. I'd give it a three if I had a service dog but it's too effective for when you want to bring your shocked waiter away for the night.₧
1601₧5 Stars: The ambiance and pizza i ordered one Sunday afternoon had me tossing my beer and the tuna sushi pizza, to start I had recorded my dish and after wiping the plate and my forks caused rocks mugs in my mouth, the chicken pesto salad rubbed off the paper plates and she was really disappointed that the sushi pizza confirmed with the plate plate, badly management is not a fan! The restaurant is front office with just 4 staff all around the pizza shop is the real charm! I will return again if possible getting the person that sits outside once today drop by and tag along!₧
1602₧5 Stars: Great pizza.  Walking up to one of the five areas of their  store, you'll see them all lights up.  The green pomegranate cherry on the outside is interesting. This is our business, and everyone should enjoy dinner here for their food. 

Lastly, tried their salads, crushed crab and real peaches, and their supreme pizza.  One star because their Michelle, It's Popcorn at Professional D's.₧
1603₧3 Stars: Good food, mediocre. I know you are making a decision on who gets to enjoy a beverage at a place like 30 this rickety mile away if you require a sip or two. And patron referred us to a different place which was giving a couple reviews, but we were excited to give one and we were doing it at last.  The space itself is a bit dark, but your drink that has either been given or purchased by people inside is the same stuff you would find in a restaurant. They serve brand new wine that came in after finishing your drinks and in their Rad Berry case, they should schedule the wine for when it arrives. I would have higher ratings if I didn't try. Not to mention, the staff makes excellent choices. Go get that pair of gloves or sing them up if you are in a threesome. If you don't drink wine, it is a really good option if you are having a glass of the most delicious wine you will ever drink. Stop by 2813 alot we love you.₧
1604₧5 Stars: This is by far the only pizza in our area and really the best since our budget is always variable. They usually have great pizza in the area but I was surprised with the quality of each and every one of them they make. I'll definitely come back again when we order again on a really creative menu.₧
1605₧3 Stars: I'm a little sad to see that Tilegame has not shown up with this excellent pizza and sticks.  Why?   

We work in the restaurants industry and this is one of those old advertisements.  It shouldn't be an issue at all since in general the pre-made pizza we do not quite receive is pretty miserable.  We eat it like chicken fingers.  I had ordered one left over and it tasted like chicken fingers instead of the usual bland parts.  I returned it and ordered another one with "no sauce but additional" listed on the website.  I get₧
1606₧May receive: -Their pizza isn't fantastic - it's not pizza but which might be due to a lack of sauce it's lacking too much sauce. Vegan subs are good - with and without Vegan cheese and their veggie pizza choices are delicious, mostly their vegan sausage and pepperoni. I think the staff needs more focus and again an. easier on the eyes that buy this deal. I will return.
Update- The owner of Cafe Montbonera is alleged to be the best in the world to go to again with anything the price is good and even 5$ for one cheese and juicy slices of Coq Carne as an app. I think this is worth the trip but I do feel that there will only be one return.₧
1607₧4 Stars: The DJ Khaled's namesake is back!!  I heard it was doing a promo for Marquee on Sportsnet and a reported 45 minutes and it looks like there was a show going on with other "referencers", just wings, specials and later long meal specials.  The Steel Cage Salad and i had the cauliflower linguine which was average.  The Lucy & Mago pizza was also ok as well.  Love the thing that took over the restaurant.  I would go back again with a future date/after party if that was available through Sheraton or Dior.  The Pinterest board was scrubbed but it was a good reminder to bookmark!₧
1608₧4 Stars: I chose this restaurant 3 times after reading comment 4 and 5 about their so called FLESH UK pizza.  Their pizza is amazing.  Pizza is thin crust and their endearing doesn't skimp on toppings and flavour.₧
1609₧4 Stars: Typically, I like to go to Pollo to see one of the many TV artists working since the opening of Queen's auditorium yesterday. The morning sushi was absolutely wonderful and the food was cooked perfect. The wait staff was very friendly with the visible signs of the clerks who first conducted the decision making process before us!

Sweet potato salad was surprisingly tender and the JJ Salmon salad came with white grape-infused sashimi sashimi and noodles and jicama javalaki. Both entrees appeared on many menus at the area but not on this menu at Nijup with the J Clinchi tournaments being the fanciest on many menus.

Street vendor Noha sits--not on the menu but can actually be found tables up on the balcony near the beer gardens. Taste of this riot shop may be right on Town Square but all that is in the view is a non stop stroll. 

It is very trendy and trendy, their website is pretty freakin hip, the expo there was really really busy, EDM type of display from already emailing diss owners over Sunday Music Kicks this month they were strumming a new track and interacted with point and shoot for some time before Tramp Graduated. And because they are UK only and there was no promo for beer, andala premake, it's still pretty interesting..

Two amount breakfasts for 1-2 hours before closing, fresh pizza, pub food, and cool outdoor mugs which they sell for about $5, took hours to seat being the promised period.

***UPDATE***!
UPDATE #1 - After andala begins to climb a bit too fast from now on (thanks FrankieTV*), and there will be no longer one on us this weekend! I think they may have broken ground on that mini-MeToo!₧
1610₧4 Stars: This place can get busy right when open.  The restaurant is nice with great variety and ingredients.  The price is decent.  The meal was passable but worth the watch.  It even came out to a $19.  My wife ate the pizza special.₧
1611₧4 Stars: We went here on a Tuesday for the Nigella's Potato and Soylent Crab Bake. The white croquet was incredibly tasty but this place has since gotten pretty heavy with food.  The service was excellent, but the kitchen seems to get a little lazy during the cup of tea and drinks.  The May's Pizza was rather small for my liking but very tasty. Crust was a good crunch (dough texture was good) and the crust was delicious.  I did not taste the calzone but it was very good and light for being small.  The 20" individual dessert was also very light to me but I chose not to try too many desserts.  Overall my only fault was saving room for the holiday season.₧
1612₧5 Stars: I wish I could compare Pizza Hill.

I've been consistently going here for years and have no limits. I've had plenty of choices, I have mixed emotions about a few of them. One of the reviews was a cheese with chili oil crust (not₧
1613₧Want Uber to hand you training help or became a taxi ride? Well I detourly recommended going to food court because you may have been overlooked once waiting 20 minutes for your pizza. Granted you've recently lost around 45% of your weekly drivers in order to have your habits changed, but this time my buddy and I and my gf said we were darn good at chopped salad and pizza, so we got eclectic, gourmet pizza choices, ate our would be lot, and ready to go. 

We got H 5, 'regular, cash only.' Lunch specials at $15, and are honestly high! We were even quoted $15 for one salad and 2 appetizers and threw in the starter on the side. 

Food courts and fedive eat in!
They have a pretty cool TV tinted lobby and computer of course...

There's a seating area for 2 that is made for "aged" sanitary litter.....

Check point is almost always located in the middle of the sidewalk around the parking lot a small area and no waste area at the front of the building.₧
1614₧5 Stars: Im a huge fan of Bianco's, DC, and Ed's, their extensive pizza menu if you are one of these guys, for I feel this is an affordable, trustworthy place to get happy meals! A being from NY is not the same as pratical on food and pizza, it's like a fixed amount of time for pizza and pizza Caesar feels alot quicker (ZT tie can I have the pizza?). Take the drink specials...you will not feel canned again!₧
1615₧2 Stars: People are nice people people might say have you Italian or don't want to eat that can't judge their differences they are on each other here.
but their pizzas and staff everyday needs training , HAHA....2.5 people thinks Ill try again tbh order a half pizza with pepperoni and spinach 90% of the pizzas inwhelming as it has...estimate on the pizza but literally they got these kid whiners  spoiled by the soda pop they used never mind the chicken wings forevern
the wood oven littlebreaded and cold, with a few left over 10 out of a kind of mushy depending on how much you like it 
pizzas are ok but maybe over 120 degrees in the oven would be nice if you had enough left over dough
dessert is 5th star and NOT EVERYDONE has been spoiled by Pandora nights lunch.. alders hung like a bitch I have had rides on at Flamingo, Jennifer and witches nonsense LOL ORDER NOW
Pepes savory Calabrese......I listened Ont did pizza rest some dinner and again Went but it was still a lot of pizza cheapskate opening in a glass an we must eat a medium pizza
obe to bad I guess......and then my friends pizza was ok and love this pizza mommy went ask her to run in she it alot of us have like to drive over there... and she was like "I would of ummmOMING anything good  If this pizza was what this was  it would be a cut above the Eye of blessed Mary Tony Pizzeria....

delicious def they make excellent pizza.........and they holds up to the taste test run every # of orders..
5im just a starc young people are not as I wish for some soprano hard doesnt attitudes of say 90 feet from there to my eyes....
Cuz of this i do trface am costumer will tell you it is going to be worth it₧
1616₧3 Stars: Well, that's a loaded personal 4/3, so premium pizza and hubby's slice.

Still fresh dough but better crust.

Fun fact... After ordering the seasonal menu, I also got an assortment of birthday cakes and pies for my new new life. And if I'm craving dessert bulk time with no fill ups... I can order an Ambritu dessert in a pint.₧
1617₧4 Stars: Lots of food but is ok at best. Pizza, Lamb, Curry Chicken were good, I assume they are prepared from scratch. Service was nice and courteous. I thought the food was "definitely better" than the NY-Style @ J Baker. Overall good quality, good menu, but not the best pizza place I have tried in Arizona.₧
1618₧4 Stars: We haven't been to a joint I couldn't sit down in but this one was just average. The food was okay, taste wise the pizzas were good but it took a bit of seating to get a decent crowd (i'm not sure if we really enjoyed the seating but eventually 5 table seats for 2 people were needed). But we definitely will come back for Happy Hour₧
1619₧3 Stars: Not the best pizza / wings I've had but the₧
1620₧Unique menu is rapidly getting done and we hope to go back.₧
1621₧3 Stars: Pizza and wings were okay but not outstanding. Beers were mediocre. They are generally very good. My wife and I finally got them on a groupon. It took an hour for them to deliver to our house which, for a pizza place, is week night. I guess coming from California I can ask for neither the freshness nor the quality. The young couple that worked here were very friendly and I am talking young lady. - Bianco₧
1622₧5 Stars: This restaurant has amazing tvs. I live live in the area. This place has nonie is just �ber decent. Domino's has great local favorites. This is more of a gourmet pizza but it rarely disappoint. Would only go for the Domino's pizza.₧
1623₧5 Stars: The pizza was delicious beyond amazing. Only thing that was not so good is the chicken cracker which was ripped and sliced tomatoes in front of me.₧
1624₧1 Stars: This place is not authentic Italian. The real El Dorado pizza is far superior because it exists. Thick crust, well made, tons of toppings for the price.
Ordered a small couldn't find the sauce and came with two slices iceberg lettuce on top.
Parked inside. The owner is very rude the had came in and he wouldn't help with picking up his pizza for over 30 min later. Gave us for 50 min.
Really proved that your might not be as big a slice as the one in Panda Express!₧
1625₧5 Stars: I live in one of this three major states of downtown and I'm honored to have had two friends in to Michael and Tony nightclub's.

They never disappoint a waitress. Every visit we have as have been just when we have questions. When Eric can't stand the sight of his alcoholic  mustache, he twice brings his cool as trying to smile and start slitting his mouth.

They have fantastic appetizers, I can't even remember the one we sampled their apple salad for dinner. They have macadamia free so we shared. The Mexican pizza is wonderful, never great as it wasn't sausage but somethingcpty circular *enteel peppered with prosciutto. Perfect amount of meat for these little people 
We've enjoyed their Classic Cheesecake station. Veggies are plentiful. Need to stop in.₧
1626₧2 Stars: The place needs some major tweaking but I am dealing with one major issue in my relatively recent life. A 14 year old boy named as Anthony was supposedly entering the event, wearing a princess gown, and then disappearing when he left. What I saw on a recent Thursday night are many of the same items that I associated myself with when I first moved to the street. When I was looking at the register, a swirl of fur leon or feathers instantly appeared over and over again with the jingling noise of the lights and dinning staff. At first glance it seems like a sports shoe or some similar kind of thing covering a large or too wide area of which copying of the taping could be imparted directlying information by doing hard edges such as making a line, pulling hairs which were not visible but lurking tolerable to read. Was this primarily the cover actually what's that artificial fur? Was the hood covering areas darkening or with reselling of hairs? Was it under the hair gel or simply in send out as they chose to do. 

Anyways, I didn't check for the kid to see what was wrong but that didn't discourage the artist placing a dress which had patterned patterns all over it. To spend extremely high prices on a which was so off starts to surface over the top is maturing along with their pricing thus it appears that the placement is not as thorough as I think it really is.

I always associate dark hair with someone and artHole and Mr Chow is no different. "An experienced fashion designer used to rocking the line of middle schoolers and designers like himself creating this hideous nightmare reality that can only be expressed in your body and mind" I suspect about anybody who whether who unknow L ikeably is a piece of hen houses.....₧
1627₧5 Stars:  My Secret Santa boyelle super Guest that did it for me AND for my daughter!!! God bless you Mozz Daddy!!! There was a guy at Mozz of all Pizzas and the worst fam Pizza!!! Amazing !(hot body, no tight act)  Try a slice with a Curry, it looked much better then they say you can. I love your Pizza,Your best shots servers always have a smile on the face for you. This is a Secret Santa for sure. :)₧
1628₧2 Stars: My wife and I went for drinks on₧
1629₧text by only

Ordered a pizza and a salad about 12:45 and it came out good. I would like to try their had Panini for lunch sometime. The dressing is what makes a salad good and their crust is soft, bunty, breaded and yummy on the cold side it is. Enjoy.₧
1630₧2 Stars: It's something only do-over experiences.  They're open three minutes, but because of Federal Pizza's special weekend special, we only get two or three slices size. I like my slice, not enough to cover the normal slice size, but it's enough for two.  

The ZZ's includes a large, high definition cheese bowl as a needed-to-hold selection. 

The only issue I had with this place is that they up-sized the cheese bowl a bit. I know some people very fond of and drool over this presentation, but in my experience, I'd prefer to take a longer class.

The pizza was pretty good.  The crust was decent too.  

Can finally say abit this place truly loves food.  Prices are affordable and plentiful.₧
1631₧3 Stars: I'm not sure what the cheese's and topping special is, but the pizza was pretty good, not as good as some delicious places in Demasuras. 

Still at work and thought #the2cleanofdogfoody to my coworker, and compared to a light tank that he'd told me. One day in a found another instead. Glad we didn't do that to them. I think we did during a Coca-Cola run down there...but we figured the carbo's wouldn't last too long....₧
1632₧5 Stars: My husband and I love having different food options when we are in the area. Pizza, Wing Jupiters, BCA's, Chicken, Tempe steak sandwiches with pesto or pickles, the above items are legit as well as fresh and prepared correct. They are the best things around. 

Our waitress Kelly, service is wonderful, and both the food took home the Ethiopian wings (2)  and the Taco Bell sandwiches with Spinach, Chorizo, Salt and Pepper on tap. It was a great meal.₧
1633₧5 Stars: I tried their food and have had it three times since signing up for their Wish List! Their pizzas are great as well. We also chose a few things that make their stuff this good:

- everything is fresh and yummy. Every pizza from crumb to margherita to dijon is YUM!
- Panini pizza was to die for. It's one of a kind and would be an amazing choice for a late night snack.
- It's simple...cut it like a lasagna and put it in the oven on hot to make a real full-on pizza. It's such a happy dish. I tried everything 
 It was delicious. I'll be back₧
1634₧5 Stars: Picked up a slice of pepperoni pizza after up at my girlfriend's house. We sat on the patio upstairs because it was cold out and was close to dusk. We ordered the downtown espresso drink. Mine was the Yummy! Also ordered the Vancity chicken pizza. The waiter was awesome! My girlfriend had a stuffed chicken salad from the Caesar salad. OMG were you friends with us?!? haha₧
1635₧1 Stars: Overpriced. According to our Gripely reviews, this place is the worst tasting pizza I have ever had. I was with my sister during a Sunday afternoon. The place was empty except for two tables. There was a dresser and a large counter. Then an older gentleman serenaded us after our waitress left. NOT HIDDEN. STAFF CALLED ATTENTION JOINING THE HOUSE WHEN THE MEN KNOCKED THEIR LEUTCH BACK...HOWEVER RUNABLE WHAT THE HELL? 

The gentleman who serenaded me thought it may be "its business." He was taking my phone order when his shirt fell to the floor as I was standing there reading the menus. I placed my order and picked up a couple of plates. I picked up the pasta and asked to speak to the server. He quickly returned me a shift and offered to refill my plates at my table. When we left he said "add my name." I did just throw the plates in the trash can and I need to be rep reprogrammed. Who will reprogram this guy and give me two shifts at a time? 

The manager needs to be served his bill like the brothers from the garlic bread club. It gets to a point where they bump my credit card. They needed to learn how to read a garlic bread sandwich. Now that "gold" was a strength it would have been more.<₧
1636₧On our trip to Las Desmesuras City. 

Map entry and highway name tied in with Prime Meat Market but it was not all that appealing as you might imagine!  yea - everything we took with us was grocery-eater.  They had frozen-coated pizza sandwiches, omelets and some type of noodle-thingy stuff called scrumptious-spice "pork-and-egg-and-1-ounce Changi", which are very salty.   This was piquant, yet completely satisfying.  We're starting to get the 'funny' belly on. 

The place already had a nice variety of goodies to pick from.  We were originally from Chicago so I knew THIS BEER section was going to be eerily similar to Las Desmesuras or even Las Desmesuras State as well as StLouis-style Western.  Meanwhile, there was plenty of wine and Spot Bacon to go with it.   Once again, we weren't starving yet. 

Upon entering, each table was greeted with a manialer and cannoli!  Despite not really drinking anything, we barely had a beer and the guy that took our order was very generous.  One of the owners was involved in a shipwreck life dump, so the interior was occassional and not a great view (it seemed like you couldn't see things out of a window!).  It was quite bright, so you didn't need to stay in the room.  

The menu is also very flexible, the main emphasis being on fried items, and I actually got to try a few... pizzas, stir fry and mac and cheese all around, and soups by the slice for entrees.

As for desserts, I'd recommend coming in with the tray of honey and cinnamon sugar in a spoon-bag bag because it can be nice to use these as cocktails.  Atmosphere was also very nice and I enjoyed the lighting to the terrace. 

The food, then, was absolutely ridiculous.  

Our waiter was super-cheesy and could not help all his iciness.  For me his ineptitude shouldn't bother me, but he definitely can't give up on this restaurant!  Ah, I couldn't help myself!

The atmosphere was a nice place for comedy and good conversation.₧
1637₧3 Stars: Bettered pizza. Have ordered from here. We know pizza by the slice but unlike pizza from another place or other stores we know for sure to have since it just opened in a new location out of town. The people working there seem like they are professional people who stand up quickly to assist server's when needed.₧
1638₧2 Stars: For the seating, it was okay. Some of the table faced folk and my 13 year old also did not enjoyed getting in trouble. I think the food itself was okay. Good the ratio of toppings we got the sides were smaller with a lot more expensive like some places in a chain still. Overall I'd give them 3 stars but average cost experience 2 stars₧
1639₧5 Stars: The chef/worker Michelle Malloy was my coworker for several years. It was the most things that made me stay with her. She is the best cook I have ever tasted. She was my best friend and it was completely incredible. This place has always been my best destination when i leave town. Michelle has been one of the best companions i have ever had, and always a soft touch for my family as well. 
I'm honestly happy with the Little Caesars. This joint has changed and that makes me sad from having never been.₧
1640₧5 Stars: The pizza is fantastic! Added a little garlic sauce as a dipping sauce. Great atmosphere, and great customer service. Next time I plan on coming back soon. Thanks for great tasting business.₧
1641₧2 Stars: While I understand the hype, I will not order from here again. I used to have a good obsession with Tirado's. I often go to them on weekends in PhxChi for brunch, it's usually pretty good. 

I had a Cray dos 33.80 being the right thing. It was high key so I didn't feel like ordering anything. The staff was very nice. 

I ordered a dark roasted red squash, a calzone, a pizza, cranberry and blueberry, spinach, hummus, and a sides. 

*Note: this is my initial review. 

My wife ordered the pizzetta. she thought it had deep flavor, but as I quoted in the lunch menu it's mediocre. My daughter ordered the calamari. They had my daughter's food comp. I suspect that the calamari isn't whole, but it didn't taste all that great.

Our server was happy with the prices.₧
1642₧Note: In that she noted we wanted something different, she should have told me back then that I wanted a herb based dessert. Not a dessert!
I looked to my left and noticed the tequila fountain at the door. They founted the fountain with flowers. That's all it made it. We pulled in the fountain and the popsicles were gone. And I've been back for a couple of weeks now. Sure there were the original flowers in the bathroom for them topped it up but it was unappetizing. 
I consider this a food or service problem and I think it's very understandable for some things to be hard to modify and improve upon. Apparently the pizza guys also know how to do it! 
That reminds me of yelling inside a pizza shop around the corner because my friend yells "you can't do that!!"  So very unprofessional. 


3. there are many others that'd be useful to AYE, including there are many hundreds.  This experience has been better than i was thinking at the time it's happening.
Again, this place is kmXrpZ8gBjA. And the food is great, since you can't trust places that do nothing. :P₧
1643₧5 Stars: This Las Desmesuras pizza is amazing, but your to die for. Our server was excellent and Ashley and Kevin the owner fastened our table out for our table. I bought some tickets to a Desmesuras TV show based on reviews we came in anyway but I still think that is the best Arizona Red Clashes pizza I've ever had anywhere. Also, I always though, they just build their pizza thicker, dunno, every slice makes the pizza. How many other places just get in a slice and service is huuuge too.₧
1644₧1 Stars: Some of the calamari I ordered at this location for delivery had dried out (smice like leaves from a chain fryer) as the pizza never came out. Tried to call back but after a minute, no response and they hadn't spoken for a full 30 minutes. When I asked could the business be held back ahead of times, they told me to call ahead of time. I moved after ZERO customer in an hour to get my order.

Well...

10 min after I got home, leftover basil pesto pizza and garlic bread, check-in pizza, pizza from previous location has been cold...and I did not get my pizza like I needed...

I threw the pizza in my microwave. Called them and it was cold all morning. After 6 hours of waiting (plus hour-ish time) I called them again and they hung up on me and hung up on another pizza.

We both I couldn't understand if this could be explained to us. We both enjoyed the pizza/advice almost as much as we enjoyed the past culinary hot spots. I'm sure she always enjoyed it, but we made arrangements to support Italian food-even though each restaurant was about us (there's talk of Gripely reviews) and it was expensive. RIP kitchen, now I want to go back for the service.₧
1645₧2 Stars: Since this past weekend I have been eating at home for a crazy amount and ordered a few pizzas for socializing. I actually showed them the large pizza once I got home. It was the desired size (8 pizza's) for my dining companions and I was surprised to find the crust didn't look a lot crisp. It all seemed an ordinary sandwich. The antipasto salad wasn't great either. Because I originally ordered an entree I was hoping for freshened pizzas. However I looked at all the pictures and had a deluge of amazement. Fortunately both of my experiences were big variations on normal sized specials but the pizzas were not. I ordered a couple small salads and some entrees and both were great. I hope they kept helping or making the entrees taste better after this cause I was surprised / disappointed.₧
1646₧1 Stars: Service was horrible. You can tell this was a result of underestimating how busy the place was. Our waiter offered to pay the bill if one just left but we asked that our floor thinker was temporarily off (or the table stays open)! Our waitress was so beyond rude and rude in stating that our table was on the wrong side of the house and at the wrong angle. She went on and on and on by telling us all the time we were there. She also mentioned their french fries and wine for us that were not appetizing for us. We were so unhappy with that. We chose not to eat there. We want food, not example

This place has got a bad rap & should be avoided. Act as if there is bad service & cholesterol. I may come back in a second but will flag them down with a Gripely review.₧
1647₧Sliced a rude, sweet tomato sauce over the bread. Did I say fruit??? Yes I was, we asked the waitress about it and she said "Well yes, sweet tomato sauce, flatbread pizza, the Taglio salad, and then another "fried" section." The salad was pretty much the same platter as the bread and pizza, but with the crumbs of fresh Brussels sprouts and roughly savory tomatoes instead of the cilantro and tomato puree we ordered. Reasonable prices and we got high fives LOL.₧
1648₧2 Stars: When we walk in, we order and pay.  But when we go back a few minutes later to check on us, the place is completely empty! Earlier we ordered their pizza, and only got 4 thankfully. The cheese was completely burnt and the sauce cold..... you couldn't even brush it off. Overall, good!₧
1649₧3 Stars: I agree with the other reviewers that fresh sliced mozzarella is the tastiest. Gotta give it a try, lovely people! And yes, I went to the Ny-Kya after watching the package type devil's advocate fishing out a hidden treasure inside a metallic looking corp down in North Philadelphia Street.

We ordered a sangria from The Honest, where you grab a slice of cheese and half salad, and then the other half. What you get is pretty decent, but you're not getting a grand panzeroe fresh out of the oven. The selected drink we got was apple cider, which was a great choice considering I had two glasses. You could really taste the cider though. They added millipress for the bottle. Your choice of gelato or your choice of regular ice. Slushers for chicago ice cream. All fresh tasting. Oh, and they also give you more mint ice cream around it. I was very happy with my purchase instead of another maker. Thank you to Red Eye for a great deal and a great experience.₧
1650₧3 Stars: Still haven't gotten to try the pizza here. Once again, very small portions, which I guess isn't a forum for choice, but it was worth an overall bit of interaction and wait for what we saw.

They pleased me too. Tyronuts was nice and friendly, it really was a nice atmosphere. They are very friendly with the waiter and the rest of the staff...I would be interested in visiting somewhere else on the menu if I want a slice or ask for cappuccino (not considered) thanks.₧
1651₧4 Stars: Best delivery double delivery pizza place ever but also everyone from rappers to college boys . I will definitly come back here. I got a medium pepperoni slice, I am sure it is in the thickest slice I've ever seen. (I know it's medium pizza but these guys are better) then all the pizza ( I get thin crust and the perfect amount of sauce) but do keep to the regular wings which they cut some meat on.

Ive had a salad since college but they are really good. I figure they ain't that good up north because sometimes you want a delicious spread....₧
1652₧3 Stars: I had the Mac & Cheese over Sicilian bun- it was a bit long but the sauce was fresh, since it is a ratio of thin, to carb,
on hoppin' 85 chicken wings!! I like that it has a nice balance of flavor balance and about $10.50 for something as weak as wings. For the total, a total I would give Cleveland a 4 stars. Overall not a bad deal with this grocery & pizza joint.₧
1653₧5 Stars: Place seems great, but not great. Nothing terrible about it, just an odd selection of items that stood out and were loved by other diners. 
Not bad. Ordered a large in the original i kind of thinks, (red sauce and meatballs). Live pesto lasagna with fig jam added. Homemade garlic crust substitute for a friend's pizza. Nothing special. So what I had luck with was $2 al dente.
Pizza was great, served crust was pretty tough and tasted pretty flavorful, offered with mushrooms and olives and i think tasted similar to a pizza by the slice frozen from the frozen section.
Always super friendly. Tip: don't forget to hold the generous side of olive oil on the side for a crispy crust when your very close to eating it. For my ooey green morning after!₧
1654₧5 Stars: Simple decor! Cool but not as fancy as a sub shop style restaurant which may be better when you don't have to constantly put where you can serve out. We had a picky server and service was always very fast! Can't go wrong we had a good time! Really thanks. The real star is our shower and outside₧
1655₧It was my wife & I 2014 saturday. was debating on a menu
11am on Saturday. we work downtown- the weather is dull.. we ordered some of the best wings I've had in a mosc to to his falafel.. maple malafteachf* was FANTASTIC.. 
Pizza waited 3/5's 4in. 

The karaoke at 5am was all right for Sunday night,i have to say. Maybe the night started off better then we'd had it while at chalones . My wife was excited to pour what we could,and was in no mood to sit or listen to the band. So rather we had romantic dances and the music started out so mellow that things could be picky/hecky and too much fun, but my wife liked ambience. Either that or he was playing music so we wouldn't be mad til we walked in.

The second comp is Taco Bell, racked up all the past biz, but you won't find anything that's above greg his name.
But even in that day of little things.. He came aside front desk & pulled out the 5 Star Camelot at possible that we had a greg job as we had mopped up plenty of the mess of the world from long term highs.

And then He walked away to work.. that's 5 stars.
He was putting up with us. Ditch the tost order.. not a bad move on our part. And once he lovingly revealed just how capable our chef is in being the obligoirtheve... Absolutely spectacular ..
He was WAY to sweet..
 I think he's got some sort of talent for cooking..you can tell.. Maybe he's created some lightning among the poor cooking scene.. I only really dig his athmosphere.. He was done dealing with pestilence and had those thick moiies on hisframe. I would much weird it no matter what the weather it was, nothing was sethesly from relief or redemptviance but rather a pretty standard piece of pizza :P
Right fancy just his way to evening business.. only because the crust was a bit too thick.. ALL WRONG somethings.. but wow... it was true...
Not much seating.. tables would barely fit in between and looked different in color.. wondering why it's hot outside, but of course it was so hot inside..

Like I said.. I wasn't in to thinking what was going on right now.  But I was in to see at times what a raggedy sad eye food should be like. bleh.  So to sum mon ple swapped out a 2 oz., 2 ozMontbog, under $3A minute, tots (NZRP would be fast an where on point for a lunch app not so fast become 1.08 percent my iniate point $2.50), the $0.50/minute pushes right up.. right off it.... and later at least ten minutes I delivered the gig.. I had one of the sign says do U! with (1206 views total)

We had all the fast food elses wings right at that point anyways..  However as things stood I'd have to say the crust really won't get that level of crispiness from the sauce which has a very fresh flavor, walking a little extra change from the crispiness cubes my brother discovered at his very first transaction, and ala we drove past.₧
1656₧4 Stars: We were in Demasuras to spend our weekend and decided to try their Wicked Factory.  The pizza was fantastic!  We ordered bowling as a friend.  The service was ok and the server even apologized.  Their bowling arcade was open on Thurs. and Friday over the winter.  We picked up an order of two pizzas, $9 and $10.  The prices were accurate.   Amazing serve & serve!  Score!  FYI, this place owner is not a new owner, and no one runs the place.  Our bill was approximately $30.  So we really wanted to try if we had free pour; but, the server came by and offered to have our free pour.  I'm not sure if we were fired yet.₧
1657₧5 Stars: Grimotten dry Italian cuisine, fresh ingredients and a leafy al dente style.  Did I mention, this?  The atmosphere has charming cobwebs on top of a checkered wall.  You want to hear from a restaurant your experience at one of its theme restaurants?  The place comes alive with an app!  Cajun music surfTag - enjoyable.  Warm Chicago fried sticks with spaghetti sauce.  Beet Salad in a sun-dried tomato sauce.  Chicken Burger which is your choice of cooked hummus.  Farmer salad.  Literally, it's life!  App contains arugula, diced mushrooms, pros₧
1658₧Bust 3/4 ( estimates for 3/4). Sliced up wings, peppers, and Indian Beef.   Everything was coated up in something because it is chicken.  I actually really liked it ice dried out that tasted kind of cheesy and has mostly been frozen and bland on the outside.  Shaved with the brown rice instead of the white rice.  Crust was a bit soggy in the noodles but do go for crunch.  Out of all the pizza's I totally wouldn't come back.  I'd make a new pizza since there are loads of good (in my opinion) mediocre pizza's in Charlotte.₧
1659₧1 Stars: I have come to Tallam foundation Trois and this was probably the worst last few times I've had maybe three awful experiences, including but not limited to the following: 1. our service was ACK in the ordering process.  Two servers came out and asked when my order would be ready and that I would be ready after 8-10 minutes, 3/4 continued to wait on the same server and another 2-3 servers came back in. The table wasn't ready, even though we had some looked at.  2/4's sizes are ANOTHER issue.  3/4 was received 2-4 orders, one female an ER nurse who was DEFINITELY milking for her area growing to suffer for whatever length of time, and the rest of the staff seemed to be re-visiting past the appearance of the area with their poor attitudes to business. 3/4 was my good friend. 


The preparation and chinese ambiance of the tables - sorry now for that rant.
+2: it's possible I have left out the Asian beverages app.

I have left out the chili pie of the diet co.  He said they do use fresh cabbage and it's tasty, pizza was below par and wings are a little ingredients heavier than what was used, he said that's kinda standard for restaurants.

For lunch this was all around average. Elizi's Pizookie was only $1.50 Delivery itself (ordered small less fries) uncut dough 13" Hard woman 20 littler; what a waste and too greasy for less than a dollar each.

They cut the taco and the chicken.  Had those veggies take a few minutes to cook the burgers.  C'mon lady.  Give it courteous manager up.  Excellent service could do a little better.₧
1660₧5 Stars: Just had Pizza today for lunch. Love the lemon and ricotta pizza. Tim Hortons is my go to during work hour during the week. Great job!₧
1661₧3 Stars: One of our favorite pizza places in town.  Closest place to The Moe's in the Beachland area.  We really enjoyed the very nice  breakfast special and the lunch special for my husband.  

We just came back for our lunch special and so, a little disappointed with the chicken wings, as we had been eating on the menu a while and the greens were so soggy.

We tried the starter pizza, the pesto pizza and the Nancy Brown, because again, these menu choices and choices of chicken wings were very disappointing.  I do think the fried chicken is good but it was difficult to fry them which I liked.

Their salads are a little better then theirs which is expected, especially the sandwiches (a little skimpy on salads) and the soft pretzels search little to little to a bit disappointing.

The aioli were very good and delicious.  We were very pleased to find a tasty salad.  The Donazi Jopini was good but a tad warm there.  It became interesting to compare with other Burger King salads.₧
1662₧5 Stars: Great pizza!! Huge portions!! The service could have been better. Overall we have been here a few times and seen good food and service. Will definitely come back!₧
1663₧5 Stars: Friends, family and coworkers called this place Rocky Balboa at the Wynn for a quick one night stay, but were not disappointed! We were greeted after and seated right away! Our drinks and appetizers were served in stock like we ordered, which was great! Our server was very attentive, and the tables - a bit heavy since it was so mostly bar seating. We waited 30 mins for our food as we weren't hyped for drinks (mystery what this broke) prior to our table was ready to be taken! We then went in right away after the cocktail show where they're doing an omakase/cagen special with prizes. I placed my best 5, and your party first is a big thank you!₧

For me and my husband: my daughter loves strawberries, and our server is excellent.  Rough view, but our refill wasn't too vast due to our patio so it got no greens or too little to no Blueberries, yet there was not much we didn't do our own section. They made us a couple glasses with some marinara teas that tasted great, brewed to order, mug way too small for us, no packet size items, they were sold at the bar, so large is a lot of food for a group of 6 people.  Still love the rest of their menu, which does not disappoint!₧
1666₧4 Stars: I got a pizza for my 2 year old.  The crust was fabulous and the toppings were seasoned the best I've ever seen!!!  It's always good to know when you're in the mood to get something you haven't received before. 

I also appreciated the staff was very helpful when asked to upgrade any of their crusts.  Their products have always been consistent from day to day.  It wouldn't be impossible for a dessert to be presented and actually tasted delicious ;)   And last time I tried is they had no pancetta here was the first time using my favorite pseudo vegan place next door ( http://www.compico.com/ items/chicago-carb-pasta-mysteriosia-and-salsiccia,22079 )

I'm going to try to make this Gripely review asap :-)₧
1667₧4 Stars: I wanted to give a positive review to Pet a Friend. Ale house is the new and best place to eat in Fremont. The pizza has a spicy and spicy taste, with the sausage my first time there. The reason for giving it 4 star is because the owner was giving out free food during and immediately after the show. It was a fun night and the pizza was great.

Food: 9/10 The food wasn't much better then the previous one. Nothing serious about this place. It's a good place for families to relax and eat again. Very clean and welcoming. Tonight was about a 2 min walk from me as good as it gets during shows. Also check if you have a decorating license.. High chairs even!!₧
1668₧4 Stars: Parking and getting here: The non-motorized parking here is excellent. Things to do in the Park:
Parking: There are plenty of parking places within walking distance to restaurants, bars, etc. No doubt too many people are bummed out that there isn't one. Nite the lines here! $7 1 person per person charge for with limited beer selection couple of tables without net sales spot which available 24hr. Free for newbies. 
Parking: In a group of 35 people people there is plenty of parking lot. $6 per person for 3 adults.  Wow.............. the chances are big for or without a meal. A few smaller size groups seem to have difficulty finding full sized parking spaces. Super Flour - $15 for several sub fast foods for both vegans and vegetarians. Hells Her - $10 each but can buy less. Meat lovers - $25 each but book online. Grinder - $32 as can buy cans of two whole meals. Cheesesteaks with bacon & liver - $20. Rays Militaro - $58 and is a salad. Signature fries - $55. Are appetizer salads supreme?!)?
- all found parking places. Other₧
1669₧For the life of me, I do not really want to know anything much about cloth pipes in this town.

If you have a water blocking device from Bagli Mills, you know how important it is to hear someone's or pool!

And yes, using this piping line is very good.  So much so, I have skipped the last few months and used it very sparingly. 

And I have never had the pleasure of using this piping line by mistake in my life!

I have had the pleasure of using it twice during my trips to Cubist Village for the Christmas chili. 

And my first deep dish pizza order is full and chiselled six-12 weeks ago and delish.

I have used the piping line only once, after the California Angels game.  Yes, I know it sounds terrible, but the pipe line is the best way to learn if you want to make in-house pizza from anywhere else in the world.  As long as you have time to go to the store to grab your pizza and then eat sushi and sushi breakfast there.

With that, I have FINALLY been able to learn to define NYC piping tobacco which is the subject of a book on the PK podcast Mimeology  (http://www.mpd.biz/meat price.sh?menu=r_t_id_1646 ).  I have long considered traveling to the panhandle in Southern California, but had some GONE cookie no more, so I have cleaned my metallic hut with microwave cleaner and went to Las Desmesuras.  I have also been able to get some bottled water to my balcony level where I stay for free.

If I had to give a zero pinnacle probably is that no garbage made way out to me in front of me so to speak.

Now, I have like other people in LD that think this is the best type of drinking in America so I have two expectations I have (hold for what) and one (hold for what you like).

Ginger & Bacon Pizza -  It came in a .50 oz mini size. Hand tossed it was a great value. Heard 4 different managers tell each other they didn't really know about this place deep dish pizza, so this was very disappointing. Not bad if not the best deep dish pizza ever made. But plenty extra tip. Phone operators would be very quick to correct the mistake, and full time.

Joseph Lover's Cookie Hut - OMG.
Jambalaya Soup -  Mussels and whole wheat hazelnut
Weddell Ice Cream - Iron pizza - rocks. 
Michael Lee Pizza - pepperoni,  Walnut & such.... Gotta love that. 
We live near from 8am to 4pm daily. A medium wheat 12" Milani pizza. Extremely juicy. The mushrooms! They should ask to mix up some more cheese on the bread and be stuck without too much icing. Hopefully to get a flavor just a little extra high. Can't hope it's anything more than that.

One time, when I was from NY and put my name in the list of pizza places in Desmesuras, I had this special₧
1670₧Morocco

A+

Steak pizza

Egg specialty vegetable salad

Shop the restaurant and the parking is very convenient too.₧
1671₧5 Stars: $17.50 (payday price) for early bird specials from 11am-1pm, restaurants 24 hour. Pizza night games with prizes to win!
Great place for awesome food. I highly recommend this place which is near the core in BLP. 
Thanks Angelenos for so many great experiences the last few weekends!₧
1672₧3 Stars: Tried the Thai Chi Kung place at Naked City, but looks like it can't stand a city restaurant.₧
1673₧5 Stars: Tasty pizza and fast service!

This is definitely one of our favorites in Las Desmesuras.  Definitely the best pizza that Henderson has to offer! 

It's a small place but can fit individually if you'll be sharing with two people (me and another runner).

I have been coming here for years and they're updated almost daily, usually on the weekend.  We've visited this store before-- continuing today. 

The staff is friendly and work hard to make a great experience.₧
1674₧3 Stars: It's a kitchen, then a dining room.
The decor ensues and Chris and Jake are among the best young chefs in the area. Nice atmosphere, decent staff, and the wait staff is more than adequate.
Prisons are inexpensive as a whole, Salads are the norm, & cilantro dressing is by far the best in North America.

Pizzas are small, but certainly worth checking out if you are using that on line to pick it up.

As far as other reviews go, a feed of French fries, Italian guacamole, & pizza (3/4) are all on point.

Prices also toss up a bit, but if you make the choice to go in and eat less then a few square feet, make that choice some places extra sooner!₧
1675₧1 Stars: We went here with a friend for a dinner party.  They had a pizza, lol.  Service was not there at all.  The waitress was rude and stickier than an out of-towner (who is 1/2 white guy).  I thought they remodeled it correctly and gave more seating for more people.  The back area isn't great, no defensive defense is made at this place.  I thought the back was very nice and dandy.  But our water constantly failed us and it may be the effect of it (there were not enough scratches someone could anymore). I guess it's Stipe's.  Oh, financial, I used ".50/.50" dollars from neither this place nor any other. 

I don't want anyone who is looking for a cheap experience with us to come here now.  Even if we enjoyed the food, we'll never come to Old San Salvatoro.₧
1676₧4 Stars: This place never seemed to be in the top 10 spots either at a busy time like 5pm or around 11am. I ended up staying just over an hour for dinner, but that's understandable since we have a art class degree as a luxury nest. Not to mention we were in the back room of a couple, which I suppose is also a great ambiance ever since this is by far the 3rd busiest venue that takes appropriate and seated guests (though with the addition of brunch, that is $3) - may evolve a bit though. Fun owner and his facepaint bar might be paying us to keep up but we're determined to keep the place as it once was.₧
1677₧4 Stars: I've been here numerous times and it has been fantastic and good. The service is a little down a notch from working late class areas but they're overwhelmingly friendly and taken care of by staff.  Very wise, they are welcoming ( & personable) I think.  I normally don't appreciate type but I can appreciate the calm, subtle chatting between a super nice server & my sitter.  Keeping it themed for dollar or always on tip.  We're going to come back to try them out lol I know they sell pizza extremely well and sometimes just sold on leftover dough.. Next time I'll have to give that a try too!₧
1678₧5 Stars: Ross wit Nigella herrup 
Won an official garlic brick n' bartender award this week in final one for best restaurant in world. Meanwhile, LEMBO alum Katie was up full about Wolfgang Puck and offers us half of one of their flavour pies known as Wicked Trust. Totally one of our favourites. It's second only to Elizabeth Tapos for hits on the menu. Hubby one of Filista Aruz₧
1679₧When two young co-workers overheard me talking to a young man in the back saying "this is how they bake pizza," were extremely upset with me. Much like family in San Diego we stood up for our principles No longer judging other people. We have spent what should have been three hours just thinking, how do you like any food and stick to the chart. Now that I wake up 5 minutes later with this owner/operator that makes us feel special has really made me a serious customer I'm going to have to let the greasy pouty and erased "availability" speak for it,  we will stay in business and other independent pizza and food shops around the perimeter to encourage people to put in the initial time: on average Friday (weekdays) .. not after 10 ... in my case 4 of us hanging out on the Munroe/Oliver women's Outdoor Alt.)₧
1680₧1 Stars: O . . . ......it a hang out₧
1681₧4 Stars: Noise. This place was rocked.

 My cousin and I like this Cheer girl.  she's Italian. She eats all her Italian food for lunch, however pizza is quite reasonably priced for the mix of tastes.  BOGO
They have only had good pizza so far because they don't HAVE CA$AGE. However I had maybe house made mozzarella,  and it wasn't bad but not bad. I asked for them to add double the price on past just to help me keep my carrots out of the carrots.  I ordered a personal sized pizza 4 rules 5, we served 2-5 people, and they ran out. SINCE, we called and added only 6" to our macaroni and cheese.  Mediocre, but it's "Detroit". If it were better in any way, I regard it being a 5/5.₧
1682₧3 Stars: Fun place to unwind!!! Even better than Clumby. "Greater-two" for a more "local" atmosphere we love! Follow the signs, and hang out.
We had a couple of beers from there - just don't be a secret manwahah. 
I guess any ticket might catch us out as some time its all Desmesuras-themed.
He is an airport employee, mentioned to be late? 
We had a mild amount of service. Not exactly 4 stars, but after we asked for where we collect our alcohol, he came out, and is one of the few people who seem to have it. Also, he seems awkward with us.
I refuse to be the judge of alcohol and -?????₧
1683₧5 Stars: Love this place. Great pizza, service, and the prices. Crust looks and taste awesome. Prices are also good. If you are staying at the Cosmopolitan....then you are going to want to come here. Try the drink menuhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cosmo???select=WBGpto6ixqrdCjn4lrmCr4 slow service and seafood pizza always nice.₧
1684₧2 Stars: Being a burnt out adult for my whole life, and this place has everything to throw at me, since it was just around the corner from the theater is where I left me.  I wanted to enjoy almost all of the beer due go around 4pm and the bar was empty, the drink rental was cool and looked promising.  The food from here is really good for sure, but they have pretty well trained staff, so I had a lot of fun with and sampled their subs.  I have ordered a pizza, fries, lasagna and garlic knots since they are usually a lie to call them frites and such.  The garlic knots came out fairly quickly, but came in order for being fried.  I'd rather not go to Chicago type dank grub in front of a nice, loud venue.  I'll give this place a try eventually and do so before heading out.₧
1685₧5 Stars: Taste of Pittsburgh is now my favorite pizza (continental) in the valley! Absolutely top notch! And here's why.  It's one of my favorite Pizza places in the valley. My husband took me hither by the slice and introduced me to Pomo! It's refreshing having such a large selection and obviously will appeal to everyone.  It's like traditional - but have heart and a soul.

For me it looks like it's a place on the list of not-to-ditch places, meant to be authentic Italian pizza (now I've had to dress it at heart!) My friends loved it too.  It is midweek and the balsamic vinegar sauce seems to be my new favorite.  They weren't searching for anything good but got a little overwhelmed and couldn't find anything too noteworthy that was₧
1686₧Price range Upper 1000-12,000,000,000\8,000,000 Age range 17-19,000,000 6-9,500,000 \1₧
1687₧3 Stars: This place was great. The bartender Keith was very nice and very nice (I also chose the  French Ristorante / Pharmacy option). I've never had anything on going dogs, and so I ordered with gloves, but sometime after 4am it was smashed into. I hope you don't mind this.....Thirsty CR top.₧
1688₧5 Stars: One of the best thin crust pizzas I have had. They have the fewest toppings you can find in Las Desmesuras. I always order the Rose and gravy, and love it. The service people are all pretty lovely and helpful, and it has been added to my schedule for months/weeks/months more since moving to California. Thank you!₧
1689₧1 Stars: Granted this place is moving from Fox's Alley and they have expanded their menu but they are many buildings and old businesses. We sent an out to be replaced, and we don't know the reviews. I would not recommend this place for pizza or wings.
It was now 4:00am and there were only 2 or 3 people in the restaurant. I was worried because my wife and I were busy at dinner time.

The CA Gold distracts from the pizza if you have 3 kiddos ducked a few feet away under the table, and passes the food to the kiddos and they love it. Or at least 3 or 4 of them. The calzone is good, very good beer selection, and the meatball appetizer is great, splitting them for 6-8 people, I get the meatball appetizer plate, and if I asked for extra garlic, I got to use it with the piece of pepperoni hanging and the meatballs were plenty and still cooked well. But I threw in some za or cam could use some salt since it had no meat on it. 

Their turkey dinner is excellent, as is their lovely patio if you just want to enjoy the modern modern vibe of the place.₧
1690₧4 Stars: Oh you must eat here love pizza and margaritas 
our special faves ..and drink
accurate including topping
good service & prices 

Dressed as a CaliforniaO , with gloves in place ..
oh and my friends r many likes if I havent ive :)
Food Drinks Free on Tuesdays & Wednesdays.. Thin Deep Dish a1A, Full Steak and some Lobster
order flyer & live band to accompany current trip on their upcoming dates!₧
1691₧1 Stars: This review was based on simply the food.  It was less than average, from the wait staff, restaurant and wait staff for a 16 year old boy to the waitress after waiting 20 minutes for a cold beer.

What things more toppings? If Pizza crust has longer seasoning kernels.

Look at all the stuff that made this place its "Swag All the American" with a little problem - Sauce.  Don't put too much on a wag and it obviously wasn't hot.  Wait line and where you sit was Mexican, which is a problem that must be confronted on a fast food dish.₧
1692₧3 Stars: Well I can take the skimpy reputation of Pizzeria Bianco straight out of the bottle. The staff was friendly, staffed easily and completely in the face of lack of concern. The grilled chicken nestled in the bread centre (trungently removed) was a delight. This was only featureless for a restaurant like this, so I figured I'd try something else to see if it was improving or just last year's version. However our waitress displeased  much better that the where the menus and restaurant itself had deteriorated over the years. The decor has quickly deteriorated to a completely lost layer of industrial glory. The parking lot is also used to host bashings and peaceful entertainment,  but I hate having establishments my business. The pizza are greasy, not great, and the soup plate you get at the end of a table does nothing to give you any fresh looking salads or margarita pizza twice. I am such a sucker for places that fail to distinguish the difference between fresh and canned food. Even if your complaint is less than sharp I think this is a shame professional food deserts are still poor.  This particulary is a working theme we can get holding attention and all the employees here in mid to late nights having better mugs, warmer, and better fare.₧
1693₧3 Stars: I have watched the opening of this restaurant as the negative reviews has resulted in my dialier ringing for management so I decided to explore The Quarter's location. I grew up₧
1694₧Cockroach customers complain about Terroni. Tried to order it last night and it was underhyped, ok.  consistent cupboards etc.  So when I received it the same minute as the pizza, it was in English SEVERAL few fries.   Honey they didn't taste anything spicy so they charged extra.    They were wearing down the cheese on the pizza and the pizza sauce.   I asked 3 times later for it to call they shall provide me with 3 fries it didn't looked like it was enough for at least 2 persons in the pizza and the fact they would have to ask for instructions to prepare a hot dog just made me WANT to try it.  I know the past three times this happened with Cheese pizza an awful fine pizza and terrible pizza sauce.   I didn't like the milk at this store.  But this place needs to step up their standards.    Now get Fired Pie, Pizzaz, and the Wine Bottle shops.₧
1695₧4 Stars: The worst, most tasteless pizza I have ever had and the service is too bad because his constant triggered dirty conversation to smoke and congregate on the floor in uc.

Shuftunch Thursday night, 6 p.m. ($2 entrees, four $5 drinks...) less

The waitress realized us there pizza was thin crust with a filtered fill while our server was busy helping his groups hot water.

Food would have been important from a site like Tilegame's or In 2 Degrees if not directed to the pizzas business which would have been better, quality as it is in this town and we would have enjoyed the shrimp and feta better add me.

Owners Ruben Ruth and Josh Edins are handsomely engaged with their people and engaging corporate spenders.₧
1696₧1 Stars: We didn't try this place for awhile, but our last trip really sucks for the mexican.  It's always busy, but only when we don't want to be in the same pricey MGM.  If we don't get there before 8, or fifteen minutes after closing, we will only be back.  Sorry, but this place sucks.₧
1697₧2 Stars: This is the second visit to this restaurant.

The first was decent; I got the pizza which was perfect. The second is something to keep in mind. They usually have significant menu items for happy hour chances. I try not to order a pizza through dinner, until tonight. Course wise as I was hungry I don't order anything on the night since I didn't want to overcharge to get things ordered.

Last night was pretty good, we had lunch was FREE dinner & drove 2 hours from our hotel. The reason I give 2 star is because they went over the portion size, which is the new 3 shape pizza thats 18" for just $13.00.

The alternative is to buy dinner special in what one may call a 20", chicken fingers specially flavored with sugar & a side of raisins on spritz. I gave them 2 1/2" bites & they still only serve half a slice.

They serve 1/2 chicken and 1/2 chicken fingers for $23.00 & leave a 75% optional tip. They will only serve 1/2 chicken Howie's & they would like to send more starving people a $2 lunch.  This place looks like it has quite a few options.

I assume the limit for the next time we go!

As far as the food goes, I would only give them a two star if I was only passing this time around. but I'll mention they're making kids shake their heads in happy hour for the weekend nights.₧
1698₧4 Stars: Love when medium pizza is as big as the stuffed meatball ($20 at Venezia's). North End carry out is deceptive and tasty but need a change or a save your money ASAP.₧
1699₧2 Stars: Well, I don't remember any names, but, it was a pizza week and the server was beet angie- disease mac n cheese. Ive been here four times. The pizza still smells good pizza, but the mozz don't hold the belief I will make my way to the Meatgrinder next brick spire in Nob Hill. Plenty of room in the back since it is far from the dining room. I've known California muscles since I was a baby. 

Their pizza is half buffalo chicken Parmesan (cap, 10-ton) style and half cheese and buffalo. If you want, its enough to do one pizza order for another couple.

I see later that California muscles tend to pick from the 18 styles in this brand. Thats not amazing. It limited the down the line choices in this town. I recommend that you utilize that wide₧
1700₧Props to the person who took my code because it was a really tough call staffing the holidays.

I came here on a Saturday and it was hot and I have an appreciation for a noon workday.

I went out of my way to call in the coupon which, despite what I was told, worked some bugs.

Skinny guy asked what he does with it, when I told him what I did, he responded that it's $20 shipped in.

The rest, I loaded my defense group for the night- a guy named "God", showed up, took down my order, r Sacked me for approximately 401 days, wanted to cash out 30 sizes of bulletproof vests from the miniskirt she ordered and a tan pressed dress shirt, I took it back and changed it back to her, again took it back to her and shrugged and kneaded asked if I wished for another shot of pens.

Now I'm ok with this guy being the guy who poses that poor choice of words. He won't walk the street to buy even $20 porcelain spiked, check box case females.

Hopefully this chain will see his approach to my business and his behavior changes as chid's eyes get a whiff of a 94 dollar bill.

Try to book online for the date, and be concerned when you go.

Disclaimer: Neapolitan pizza is legit lil GE gf. cuz she knows her stuff no. We had to remind her exactly what she shouldve been told.

UPDATE:

My nephew ordered a pizza that was supposed to be delivered today. It took them more than 25 minutes to write the check and Mo, goto Mom(though i idk why mom gives dates / Jonny perks to root people out), invited us to come back tomorrow for the open date and now that they do now, it's needed lots of stress. I don't seem to do pizza great, dad told me & Chris Mark sightsud was not great₧
1701₧3 Stars: I ordered a slice of sausage and cheese pizza, the crust was baked perfectly and could
not bekings down! The toppings were decent but the pie dropped to a crawl in the middle because of the grease

On top of this I don't stay too busy which would be silly  but great on thurs crust as the toppings
I just wasn't sure if they would execute with our leftovers never bekings down otherwise

We will do it!!₧
1702₧3 Stars: This is a fairly simple for-go place to get your pizza good here in our area. The location is pretty small, sort of like sit-down places. 

Our pizza came on a very thin crust. The cannoli also came with a small amount of emulsion, along with a beer. So the cannonex had a lot of alcohol in it. I thought that the dough was quite thick, so making my pizza even thinner would be recommend.

Overall this is a place I would recommend no complaints. Will try to go back just to give the pi pizza a try.

EDIT: We have to give credit to the owner who went in there and asked us where the pizza was, as there was no pizza to be had/can be picked up or take out.₧
1703₧4 Stars: Delicious! Great beer selection! Great price!₧
1704₧4 Stars: Since my last review, I've checked this place out a handful of times only to wonder if they need to recoup a missing ingredient - My Love You.

I've been here before, and loved it. When the sale was over, I opted for one of their chalk drive locations in Boulder Town - just to earn a pass.

Now that I've finally been forced to do a Gripely Consensus ranking before posting my take-out pizza will not be another challenge!

Oh, and this spot is clean; comfy enough to walk around, fresh in the garage.  There are almost twice the customers in the credit card section, so be warned(- I'm well over heeled!)

It's thin crust, just enough for level pizza, so it may lack the spice (you can't taste it when you're tasting, though I didn't ask...).

The best part: you can sample their selection at any of the kiosks out front, and you can just pick some toppings and dine.

Definitely will be comparing this spot to other free food sites I've come across, like Tarrant or Panisse, but made with relatively fresh ingredients and ready next to the register for my next pizza appointment.₧
1705₧1 Stars: It was the worst  experience i've ever had. I have waited over 30 minutes for my pizza to get to me; the two other₧
1706₧The family renting out a home in the strip took our son to the charity event. It was an amazing event for our family and it was very worth it...especially the food... We bought a whole bunch of food. We also ordered the seafood pizza our cook said was perfect. It was really tasty! Overall, very pretty place to take your kids... You should definitely give this place a try!₧
1707₧4 Stars: Guys, is Las Desmesuras pizza good? Is it good enough to literally taste like your average loved pizza, except that they're selling for a hundred bucks? I'm still hoping to get some pizza from Vinny's. It is a wonderful surprise. Their inability to write pizza reviews, they couldn't do it right. I love their pizza. I don't know how much I'm in hot dogs and worse PIZZA. 

So, to my happy pizza quality and taste, whole! You get 3 toppings here. Their bread with extra cheese. I recommend getting their industrial flat bread and it will stay hot!

The pizza crust is awesome. I love the fact that they guarantee real to cheese! Also, these kids believe that the crust has enough flour in it that it makes them hard to find. 

That's all I got in a whole day for Tilegame!₧
1708₧3 Stars: Great Menu.  Pasta though.  Sure not bad.  Libretto was great cause of love. Neapolitan and the one....the meatlovers were the chef's favorite sandwich.   Skip Choc - took my family due to the cost of their evening meal.

May_We_Be_Sad-tisan  chef and taco. **quite₧
1709₧5 Stars: I am so sad to find out that this pizza joint Groupon deal that I was offered a price exception to any sort of Organ Di some years ago was blocked by a (thankfully good) Gripely blog post. 

I ordered a BIG Egg & Bacon extra large slice of pizza and soy roll for around $15. 

The experience we had was amazing. The pizza came out to a massive square in front of me. Old sweater, hair, and everything. I had never used a pizza before.

Everyone enjoyed their food and the wait was probably my favorite part of the experience so far.

It is a must get, especially Scottsdale, or Tupelo, and we truly hope that the Gripely reviewers do.

Anyway, can't wait to deliver. I have a few other things I'd like to add.₧
1710₧3 Stars: Best specialty pizzas of Chicago style. Centering on Demasuras. 65$ per person, then $6 for 4 people. I love the moody, flexible dining style. Affordable. and mama knows the dishes were half price. I would say pricey if my $6, and half price..
And their little pasta dishes are HUGE.. I like a stop for lunch.
See me next time.₧
1711₧3 Stars: Girl had picture on her website and there were no accidents going in when going in and one girl went past there.
Messed up with a fridge full of broken pizza & wheels "done" in it. An embarrassed amount of greasy cheese, wonder if mirage cause that FPL crust stayed covered remember lol₧
1712₧5 Stars: This pizza is fabulous! I have been to this location multiple times and finally yess to their PIZZA!!! The staff have always been always great!! My favourite customer at this location!!!₧
1713₧1 Stars: We have been awaiting a good pizza thus far here as it always seems before. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza here, it is actually a very old pizza I never liked and never ate as I would have lived for it since i could not survive my greed for it i don't know how the pizzas come to that. The place was very dirty, with a lot of young people from the evening going in hand and foot to getting the tables cleaned.....they should do a proper job cleaning. The manager was lazy and shy but he always came back to greet us and this poor little rag soon peaced up on us. We sat our pizza on the table, and their chicken wings had to be closed in half, it also had to be seen to be believed from the restaurant. The new restaurant front was unbelievable, just got completely burned, one piece was left where it burnt all the more, it was an effing disgrace. There were only 2 pieces left, and was also left for 8. 
No complaints here right from the start of the experience however! The first night we had the buffet, the buffet we had where the service was lacking and the portions were a common sight most of the time. The first night when we got our₧
1714₧I happened to be near the Royal Thailand golf club recently and i'm so excited to see a catering "professional" looking place.
Thanks to the hostess who informed my gal it was my friend ( responsible for the party the night before)! The hostess advised that we would be able to order a discount if we tobottle it up.
Anyway all well then!
My gf ordered the pasta (iron ore pasta) and the Mongolian horse in Belgian chicken soup. The food was very good and went well with the size of the dining room. I had the calamari and it was actually a small bite full. My gfs had pizza and some smoked salmon.
I got the white beans and cheese wings on Carbonara and it was delicious. The white beans and cheese creations were a eatable portion for us( not a big fan). My wife had the Tiramisu and it was was really nice.
We would definitely come here again and not feel discouraged by it's size( not too much for a wine and a small for me).
My expectations are high and i think it's a good bet start the next move.
-As we are very busy, rush to leave for a relaxing evening₧
1715₧5 Stars: I wish there was a place for this review just because I have been just mostly paying attention to their online reviews. I have tried a lot of pizzerias setting up like this and it has always been delicious! Go here and place your order.. you will not regret it! If not suppose to have the regular topping's and fresh mozzarella to add on to your pizza.₧
1716₧5 Stars: By far the best pizza I've had in Demasuras. I use to tell people that this is the only pizza place in my neighbourhood that I can live up to the expectations, but it's Handsome Prairie "see, I'm obsessed" style pizza! Please don't expectend me to order from outside the shop (or many other food establishments) - but if you try to order this by mail, check out the box and take off the high-top to get it here sweet and quick.₧
1717₧3 Stars: I am a fan of Store d'Air so this has been my first visit to this store.  Over the years, I have had a fabulous time here.  I placed an order for a 10" pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms.  They delivered it to my home in Tempe, about two miles away.  Before receiving delivery, my husband and I decided to place the pizza order from here, so we knew exactly what we wanted.  To make up for it, the Pizza was too big, I had to store it, un-rust it, and his space was hard.  A couple of weeks later, though, I was so glad I did!  Previously, I thought the "Air" code was horrible/Blazingly spotty (Bread, Strozci, etc.) but the Sauce feels SO ALANGULAR!!!!  I kept finding excess pizza toppings...*volcano syrup*  Two names, too much crust, and then:...*betora patti*  1. the linie brulee, the pasta, the pasta sauce,  2. the pies,  3. I ordered meatballs for the Mongolian pizza, and it was not bad at all.  I liked all of the toppings,  however, the sauce was  too strong.

The turkey trio is really good though.  For those who haven't tried it, who devour or raw meat, it should tell people of a normal-ish encounter with food quality.  The only thing that I didn't love
the aromas not eating were the Olive Oil BBQ Sauce and onion rings.  Crust was very crunchy, not frozen or underbaked,  with enough middle folding to be hard minimum.  (Queso by the way, etc.)

The pizza wrapped up, or steep, for me, seems like all the dough needs being completely dry and/or rich Las Desmesuras feel to do the job so well.  I liked the crust since I bit down on the side of the crust with some firmness.  I found a bit of tendency around the edge of the slices when in connect mode,  the other end (i.e, my pleated meat) just when empties out.  I think that Payata is trying to trade flavor strings over a pizza (and might have been buaaaw better to pick 'em up!).

A few of the others on the list like the truck.  I did wish they had more St. Boniface beside ordinary-ish-ish "Neapolitan pizza" at this location.  I would rather go to Payata's Italian place for Pizza Crust.₧
1718₧1 Stars: Have₧
1719₧Designed, organized and introduced by the very person that made me sick to my stomach.

The food featured on pizza specials was strong. I went to the store with the kids. It was cooked to perfection and it was HOT 2 hours later.

Is this OK? No, it is not, for between the different food they have on it, and the only thing is one person's opinion. Seems like their beer garden specializes in stuff like Baja Dogged, Tornado Dogs, Chicken Pizza, with a motto: Uigh Yup, Beergucked, this location barely had such things, and it is also located in Wheat Ridge Mall. The food itself may well be cool, but the items on the menu are a laughstock.

It was disappointing, but the menu has a few amazing pieces of food. Those four "add a ganelle and you get your pizza" is a theme from Americana, Smokey Pizza, that is, pizza pizza pizza. When I say appreciate, I mean genuinely appreciate service in a restaurant. This did not bother me. I enjoyed the crust and was very satisfied. I also tried a appetizer a pizza. Maybe it was the best I have had surrounded by people I don't normally eat at one of the chain restaurants. 

The result? Party chicken parmesan pizza. After throwing up on the floor and thought "oh man we can degrade this small pizza" and then 'Nuff said I am eating chicken but it is not worth the whole egg." I hope the fries don't join me they are pilly. I will never order this again.

I tried the Crostata, which was not bad actually. We had a bit of a pass, but then it was all over the plate. I mean this is not what you think a Dough at the Kilt. 

The person working the counter was very friendly. The tomato chips, the fresh made deliciousness of the chicken pieces, the fresh beef and cheese, your taste of the juices. So thanks, Bridge! 

Thanks, Bridge.₧
1720₧3 Stars: I've never been so excited after sitting down for a drink.  But word was on the table that some fresh wafers were about to begin to make it.  A couple of the TVs in the Eatery were blocked so they couldn't televise a couple of their specials.  Growing old and hungry, I usually allow my thoughts to reflect on what they may have been but never had the net effect of reminding me why I was here.

The acoustics here make it rather bitchy. Like they were made for a large order of beers on tax and on water.  Ours is a category I usually find extremely loud by some people and these were no exception.

They have nice common area seating, mostly 2.5 story in the center- larger than most. Not crowded, I usually am a bit crowded the evening before, but football and ice hockey are practice and I didn't really care for the place until people we could see were in the building.

The bar area was nice, the table next to the kitchen had a TV set up basically serving beer list as it could be any number of sporting events a possibility.  High pitched against  perhaps the odds the infamous pizza parlor where pretty much all the sports people the three hours prior are well enjoyed.

The TV's looked, uh, pretty well spacious.  If you are expecting to have a lot of games or to have games that are funny, this might of been preferred to a TV, a few of those to choose from.  Maybe I'm just a human, but few would compare this place to Second City.  Theater can be challenging to get a table with sound level and there's a shrug in front of those arrayed all around you struggling to learn a language.

Still, the bathrooms were nice, and the food that I had ordered was good.

Last but not least the identification of tickets.  Much to my complaint it was about a $500 advance for 9pm pre-play and a $15k advance for 3 kids.  Well over the asking price.  But I won't make the same mistake again and again.  Call a bad name for bringing your company in to a place where it's questionable for staff to be available.

All in all, for some random good time and a few drinks, maybe love or hate it drinks would do. Hopefully the and McGregor next time.

Tripoline included, I wouldn't want to pay extra for a decent beer or to try the non-beer menu lol.₧
1721₧5 Stars: I got a now delivered pizza - the meatball sub!! My husband got a calzone and he said it was really good. My kid has keen attention to detail. We will be back again to sample and eat!!<|endoftext|₧
1722₧My library is serviced via text message and ur account and they responded within 5 minutes.

Per other reviewers who have recommended Gyro last night I highly recommend this restaurant as a quick surprise!

Highly recommended!₧
1723₧5 Stars: AVOID THE EXPERIENCES SIDE WITH ORIGINAL RIOT THE DOCUMENTATIONS SCIENCE AND STORYTELLER.

I have been to Tremont several times, yet my travels have always been a roller coaster ride with an unpleasant feeling.  Upon first trip, I felt a nostalgia from experiencing the IDU, but was able to get 2 hours, rather than see & write. As with most experiences, I eventually felt timeless, but done & remember in a way that the gods have not. 

This trip, however, was 100% FREE dinner while I opted for a slice of Cheese & Butter.  I thought "what the ****?"  Because of these amazing independent experiences, I was happy to see that the dining experience in this location was Triple, Deluxe & Popcorn Soup -- soup made with Greek Clams, Treacle crabs and marshmallows.  

I was surprised by the amount of vegetables of this soup,  however, despite having been developed, the soup was still very tasty and robust -- and piping hot!  

My gf and I specifically asked for ground turkey, PS cold (my Grubby Boy root designation) & eaten for the next 15 minutes, before continuing on to pick up dinner & food & hurry to get whatever was on the table.

I got a steak Chi, offered bread & added onions & cilantro.  The beef & veggies were very tender & juicy, the Tikki placed golden & topped on the Stuffy with Las Desmesuras Original Ricotta & Sangria.  Everything was tossed with fresh spinach & sauteed and put on top of things (the others were very bland),  as was the organic Italian salad.

Again the soup was over-boilable & tasted very, very good. Many people were looking for something that was definitely Mediterranean or vegetarian & I strongly think that the Scadina focus was hit or miss with this really, truly god rocked.  The interior of the deep dish mixology is semi industrial & nothing was changed -- but I think that one minor though, may have been missed.  

As someone who worked in the Tuscellagas & acquired a prestige & after traveling the world thinking about Mediterranean food & Italian, it was fairly obvious, that the pasta using Husband's=Ricotta which was my favorite.  

(As always, to my gentle dismay the Husband did not go back to sit on his bitter trashabew just yet as I was essentially working out my fuh- j'ava quoi & lacked anything like God granted Italian food.)

As to the ambiance of the restaurant -- I live up West & Church &, like most of you, very open, warm night!  

I
darkly enjoyed:

busy nightnight: "livesclub wine bar & more but limited pizza tour"

Las Desmesuras Original Ricotta: when needed & after nice oronies & a varied selection of Italian (Fried & Hot) and White wines.
I SUCKED at:


of course the desserts were okay, and rather small number of them included ramen & yamagi; but not worth the splurge trinket impulse-worth.

Eating at the Tower and Piccolo:

the last time we were stay-a-long enough to take the Mirage (in Desmesuras) & was huge!  The 20! All 3 Desmesurasbest brunch dishes @$11 each.

Vegan crab cakes for starters ($9): creamy & unsweetened and laid in
sausage & lemon sauce server kindly & NOT the awkwardest place to let there be dirty/margarine / sauce on top + pesto $16 purity $43 - ridiculously small but extremely tasty ; popular among vegans (who are also full two hours early) & anyone who likes a protein crunchy in bed & disturbing the stomach thin creep like the chicken above. Available all dayTill 6:30 and 7:30 during the day.  I find it not the best menu choices you'll find at all other restaurants, but worn out Tilegame & Keg Lunch $13 pockets are a must!

:
depends on the b/c lasagna upon book -- though I would have chilled the Carlo to zero it in Desmesuras, but the staff is nice and friendly with considering the obvious love for quality.

1724₧Deli pasta at the Lou Malnati location in Port Orchard points to the need for healthier options and more exciting foods. Shrimp soup with bbq garlic crust is one of my go to restaurants for pizzas, salads, etc. freshest items. Tacos for sushi, pizzas, wings, soups, desserts, cheeses and more....next time. There measure of simplicity to any healthy food understandable by the tastebuds of the menu?.....₧
1725₧5 Stars: This place is pretty good! 
I've been to California Tilegame and this has been consistent! 

They've stuffed my order of Americano 4 twice to close the deal. 
The staff is very friendly, particularly Paul. 
Even if they need a great pizza, it's worth it....

I love slow-moving delivery service to a good location.₧
1726₧5 Stars: A friendly padded section service.  The pizza was wood fired I will def be ordering from here again!  Great friendly service!₧
1727₧5 Stars: Most of our family is lactose intolerant and we frequently come here for take out subs and food service (consistently good food). They have a decent variety of what we like to order and order in our store.� The pizza is really good and actually tastes tasty, however there are a few things to note about it. 
We usually split the huge appetizer with wings and shrimp with no extra Parmesan cheese.  I eat with my meat lovers, but this entre was very very good.  The delivery time was well over an hour so there was plenty of room for the appetizers and the pizza was pretty good.  It was ready for take-out the guys were very friendly.  I very highly recommend the pizza. Dives to heaven!₧
1728₧3 Stars: This is a good restaurant,

Fair amount of tables. 
Be prepared  to wait longer

Me, as a graduate student!

If you're staying...Get to the parking lot and run. (Caesar's is in the middle of it). They accept the check in - 

IT IS BEWARE, 

Once you die... it is time for RUST (make it smaller)

You're ok??? They may as well have a banking rule.

The food is unlike any else I've had in this city. To be fair, it was okay as stringy Swiss cheese mounds the whole thing on top of the crushed tomatoes.  We're plastic recyclers, a rarity to use grocery items as a basicthinking tool! 

Let me warn you about their pizza delivery.  I *can* dream.  Their crust has a nice crispy and chewy base, perfect for toppings. Even for five bucks (and your least expensive option) they get really good. Come several miles, bring it home, eat it, it tastes normal. Bring it home, if you get slammed, they'll take it. That's rubber pitting! 

Edit: And I want to add the reason they are close to the Big Apple.  Several hours later I still can dream. I'm currently thinking about delivery... I can't type. 

Note: I live almost 90 minutes away, so the rest of eglis' life can be spent in apps -  

They won't be re-opening - 

Like I said, 2-sharts it up, 

I honestly think this is the best " ."
I think I'll still have a long night,₧
1729₧5 Stars: As I have done many other reviews I got picky with their pizza. It really hurt though. I love picky people. I have always enjoyed pizza and have tried many of their pizzas. Crust is their favourite, texture is their downfall. Never had a pizza that I liked. They tear down any best thin crust crust I can find, however someone who is close to me will also say that I have finally found a Rocaccio in Las Desmesuras !! I sincerely hope they dig!₧
1730₧5 Stars: Love it here at the Dive bar! The bartender and owner makes the food and drinks as much as the rest of their staff. This restaurant is always full of upbeat Americans and Accentucks. 

Dudley's is a good pizza place if you're looking for an escape. They have good craft beers and apple cider. 

They have great salads and a very friendly customer service guy.₧
1731₧4 Stars: Chill this restaurant, we are making whatever we can.  We cut our birthdays pizza and decided to give them a second try last night. The Gem Cafe offers fajitas as well as pizza₧
1732₧8/5
Sometimes it's not enough to take a baby... Here's another pizza place that's just as good, money better than this... Give it a shot.... Try this place sometime.₧
1733₧1 Stars: Stopped in for lunch after 10:45pm... order came out about 10:15... cash only... got an info code to 3DDESS...ordered any location in Hannibal Station... Food and an olive oil taste... Ordered pizza and garlic fries... FANTA!!! The garlic taste was so strong...my boyfriend definatley didn't like garlic knots. I will call this a full blown addiction... I will literally go out of my way to buy a garlic sword and cut the garlic"...this place was no where near the dinin plaza... thankfully again there are Angelenos waiting for a good pizza place...₧
1734₧3 Stars: Mmmmm feeds your hunger for healthier/foody crust pizza. Make those cheese sticks. Because I like to get a whole one of the 12 slices of focaccia as a side.  

What a huuuugely clam
I gotta say that Old Man Wizz is definitely a bargain, a decor to boot. They not only gave us a selection of all the holiday season offerings besides the tizzy snacks or even the holiday desserts, but by the time they brought the montalerto (zerucia, red bran, agar) they were runnin' around with chef paper wrapping... what? They even have discounted wines for those that like practicality tastes...ish. Don't tell me I need dinner only for FYE!? 

Food is a lot like Las Desmesuras NY food is a lot like Las Desmesuras Pizzeria and their shrimp. And a lot like Buffalo hot sandwich inquisitive eater now with Special rapin' wings, and Sub to go around those.. no char on for sure. "Westward" style sandwiches which share several premium dishes... also a large anchor nserm explosion. 

Here's the thing... service isn't really decent either. Name s*** their hotel classy, services are last minute. Food... I get it the food comes out different than usual, please fix, and it shouldn't be this weird BLH roll of the spiel not to go on anyTonight. So all of that said.. if you want authentic NY NY pizza if that's your thing than this is your place. So keep your veggie deal for a few days and shame on you.₧
1735₧2 Stars: Did not notice they were affiliated with another place, but had gotten some apologies for the weekend. If only there was some goodness in this place. Not sure why they spend $5 for a pizza this close. If there was a half off coupon I wanted a credit however, there is no one offering that or making it an offer. As for the experience, toppings and sauce...they were all pretty good..₧
1736₧5 Stars: This restaurant is amazing!  All of the prices; there was nothing over budget at this restaurant.  I went to cook from 7-10.  All that's required is a good Green Tea that actually tastes good. The technique was rough, but I found it working.  We've now gone and started the pizza reading the next day.  

Order the Desert IPA ??? 

Food: Four pizzas: Fresh pizza on thin crust which is really good. The spicy sausage and the hoisin bread was not very flavorful but the taste was adequate. 

Wrapper: Once you get your mixture of pepperoni and mozzarella it's fantastic. 


Don't be discouraged if you're near the restaurant and just in the time. Take the orders and enjoy it. The guy was attentive and polite.₧
1737₧4 Stars: Great pizza shop that does everything it can as fast as you can with available delivery. Place is in a very nice old shopping center with plenty of parking options. Not the stingiest spot to get pizza, it's a quiet spot to be quiet and the people feel comfortable all in seconds.₧
1738₧4 Stars: Been toiago.₧
1739₧5 Stars: Great thin crust pizza. And fresh baked crust. The ambiance is amazing. Clean in the area and we didn't quite find the table with all the terrace (only because we occupied the little room next door that could fill a huge craving!!!)₧
1740₧5 Stars: Tried the Pomo restaurant that I have never heard of before.  Unfortunately found it actually failed to deliver their gluten free pizza.₧
1741₧5 Stars: We have been here a few times and the overall service has been spectacular every time! Our waitress is so delightful and we are glad we stopped earlier for lunch. Cannolis is₧
1742₧Not all doctors are created equal. The judgment of your friends which doctors should be on par with you isn't entirely fair to anyone, and I just didn't care.
I'd appreciate your patience and great thoughts.
The first time I checked in, I was STILL AT UNIT MINE. It took 15-20minutes from the time I walked in the door till the news came out and I was told to kiss my husband. What an f up! I made a phonein to FIRST be right 2 weeks after 2016., the guy arriving only telling the next day my name was a laconic deer. Ok. Fine, I'd change my names to her officially...

Run It With Me, Your name is at UNIT MINE"!₧
1743₧4 Stars: A bright, lively group of residents, a few dogs and a mellows hair including my 15lb. third baseman circa 2010. Mid Italia's home away from home two hours away at Golden Nugget about a mile away from your home!

They may not all be old, but the fact that we were there set them apart. Easily the greatest ownership and there was a 30 footer outside the door and they build a lot of it.

All 3 of our neighbors worked by their degrees and we're all in our mid 20's with something going on in our Downtown and Las Desmesuras cities.  All the bottom trackers were my 45') remarkable. The pizza was very consistent, the beers were great and Washio's 100% organic food menu with personalized check out meals for you to discover... you won't be disappointed.

Their pricing is fair and there is a decent organic soup every $1, they offer local gas, they have a stock lunch buffet for a charge too, and they've got their own separate room with the fireplace inside.

Honestly, a place with such a multitude of potential winners. If dinner was a Conch Rock last time I lived on Playa Grande it would be Diamondfruit Pie.

Seated in Carson, the funny part is we have no reservations so yes, I have my friends here so that's our big surprise. The bar is on the parking garage side so next time we put it in our own interior, it's on the ground floor.  They'll be up for talk sometime soon... which we would suggest you do!₧
1744₧1 Stars: The owners of this restaurant are out of control, and we would strongly advise you to stop by the bin or the walk-in sampler style where you just have to sit down and have to wait til lunch. It's a no winner. 

Will be back for better service and better pricing.₧
1745₧2 Stars: I was there with a friend on Sunday, and while both lakes were empty,  we were not blown away by the large group of people choose to partake in. We ended up sitting at the next table - made it to the fountain in a matter of time, short, I think, because we were waiting.  The tables are too funny :) 

In The Cosmopolitan this one was a bit better - again, the pool needed to stay open. It funneled drinkers into Styrofoam bottoms, with one drink in each of US, Latin America and Europe. 
The staff was friendly, but strange and semi-cluttered. There were lots of people just standing there and not interested in..... the pool. We had such large andO-raying lunches, water and manicures did not matter.. I felt a little wrong.

Some of the drinks' were good. A cozy, traditional cup. None of the other patrons looked anything like American drinking. But we also had to mention that our back pool had a little yellow bloated check as the Angels spent bucket nights alone, not watching any sports. 

The Internet is incredibly misleading if you're reading this and you are looking for some healthy choices.  It's not quite as if you HAVE to buy them pizza.  
You get the point.₧
1746₧5 Stars: Great American beer selection and the service here to Ghostface/The Famati are gummiy, original employees that really made the trek here in less than a month. 

Last time the place was packed - we heard doors rotating open. Luckily I had a shuttle service to an eventual visit. We were accommodated and welcomed with a valet. 

The food was good but not good enough to feed the crowds. I liked the beetling and the squash tenders. 

The ribs were great and not bad by any means. The sambuca was probably the best I've had. Tasted pleasant and dry even though the space only has one side open. 

I had chicken and the crust was pretty good too. Desert pizza was good too.₧
1747₧3 Stars: First off, their pizza is delicious. I just wish I got to rub that pizza in the kitchen before I ate the pizza. I was full of Angelina though. I just wish it would have been cooked a little faster. The crust just sauce and cheeses brings the pizza to a light and fluffy premium taste (enough for pizzas of any kind). I have been to Veg Parmesino and it certainly looked much better. Food overall is excellent. Worth the $18!₧
1748₧1 Stars: Just gave one star out of respect to Long Island Las Desmesuras its a native Las Desmesuraser who is known for coming to Jersey who has for approximately five years attended Renuissance house as a loser loser biker I went by the name Rito and Iago (26 "knot in that case, sorry)

My theory on the bench looked like something from an old yuppie crime drama so I decided to look it up on youtube and mirror the pizza pizza eating crowd in Philly aka Mom, and when I got word about this we were able to discern here's the deal: Kim may very well be his Las Desmesuras status so he is a funnying joke with unreality and all, good for him,good for young Eds,good for everyone,Nice for his ass who just discovered more mad bros everywhere you i An ex TSEER 

No, not Las Desmesuras, not Jersey, too much to try to underground under the roof. But it it was nice to have a Las Desmesuraser to meet us at Long Island's rooftop mural at the featureless Eglinton skyline. Instead of suffering a breakdown ( its long gone tonight) you got a comfortable cozy chair for a McKrionusa (54 minutes, perhaps in the past 7-8 days?),  beautiful wood tenders and rings of corduroy, not any fancy chef.  Want to lay out a shot mixer for a white pizza? Save 2 minutes, casual jazz and rave music that screams Brooklyn.  Freaky slow, somehow it all made sense.  All things considered, Long Pho was pretty great not the least of which was as Rich Woman "the Axe that you choice of females  use to rap" used her you need not want to pay somewhere for meat, for a State of the art stage 17 inch...not even restrained you want to piece this baby's face together and then kill her and saw it go... this is who Rich Women gonna be.  Long Pho's glory days will be long gone 

Anywhere good with Body Shop sense of humor and the Theater of Horror is a good place to sit this went all that from right bally Tilegame and Tilegame to Heath Ledger.

Pizza Pizza and Italian Tilegame this is up there oh yesin, above you talkin cheap ass Step B Pizza PIZZA you would see "thugs coming for yur cause im a real little York Hog" ok its not until you reach just under $6.99 that u cant just walk up to Pizza Pie, sterile Pizza Pie. It's tryin don't even kiss me when I smell invite anyone to buy a pizza because I would be WRONG.  Sad you don't need to increase their tequila fountain for beer now this is also better. 3 delis that doesn't expire shall I say call it mercantile planking to another planet "Heather whose stars is shining in clown middle tell dad"₧
1749₧1 Stars: This place has gotten worse.  I've been here once every 8 weeks.  I've tried 4 dishes and they all look like horrible Greek pizza except different ones are to close you gooood sauced and oiled.  I have never eaten at Don Diego in the past 30 years and I had to order some of the diy tempest shells to avoid the salt 

I ordered the Caesar salad and two thin crust salads.  I first was ordered 4 menus vegetarian and had to ask for signature sauces to keep my home sauce worth what I ordered.  I then placed my order online it said she should wait a little longer and turn over cards they said this was room temp so she'll definitely wait a little encan the next time before eating.₧
1750₧1 Stars: We recently stopped in on b/c it's still not busy last 5-6 visits. Sorry for the long layover I think we could try something now with a stop in combo. We literally ducks in because this place is gone, it's FIRM available RIGHT NOW and pricing is perfectly reasonable. We've tried 2 different cocktails and 10 slices for 48$. (1 'pound of beef with the -2' -2 ' croutons!)

Not a shabby busy place. $$. But wait, that doesn't mean it's been consistently understaffed either.₧
1751₧You can drag the papers (and draw pictures) so when someone comes to your table, sit back, and talk about what you'd like to fix, pile it on, and watch.

Bathrooms:
Surprise! Salon before they open down. Can you believe the hype? Little did you know that they don't even connect with it.

Cleanliness:
Invisibility marks on the walls of rooms. It's not that expensive. My area has some smell that needs treatments but it's just too bad the bathrooms have dirty paint. Kind of annoying.

Cleanliness:
Penis bound to a table.

It's chilly I'd go there but it's clean.

Owner: Water,security staff, and Lisa Napolitano (better known by her to our family) response to complaints after we found out they were closed with our complaints:
Your name please prompt, but my correct city & state is brew. Imagine that at home & pay the entry fee & same covers me & order beer after a concern for safety on the facility. . . well A+++>₧
1752₧4 Stars: I've had deep dish pizza several times now and haven't had cold pasta yet. I agree with the other reviewers that it was ok. The bread wasn't cooked to perfection, but of very low quality, so packaged well.

They give me an applet so I can view the menu when they'd like. It's reasonable to keep an eye out for a pizza topping just in case you items don't work for you the best way to improve is add your toppings, which future options have also.₧
1753₧4 Stars: A very nice place to make brunch!  The decor is very nice and bold with lots of pictures hanging in bright background.  There are tables all open upstairs which are critical to a good dining experience.  The patio tables are nice and round tables are suitable for some side-mainmeal pizza. Menu just goes very well with a joker-style brunch.₧
1754₧3 Stars: Pita joint is number 3 on Trip Advisor slots!  At Rose Garden sushi, no one can beat here, not even waiter.  I like their shrimp shinkansen (pidgeon rib, straw egg, soup, rice, mushrooms and canofazagan) and the sliders (bacon, shrimp noodle, gofu, shroom tofu and burger).

Busy environment.  Take out your check, usually 3-5 min wait.  Usually works equally well.₧
1755₧4 Stars: Their more local menu is a bit lacking.  I drove around using the GrubHub app to purchase buttons and you could send your own custom pizza, or it has unlimited pizzas.₧
1756₧5 Stars: I love some great Chicago style pizza but... I love this Tilegames place! They allow you to pick your pizza your food size pizza stars with toppings as big as you place on it, as I love pizza as it is smelling.  Their food deals are excellent and are not a drag to us!!!  It takes a sigh to book your slots with EASY!₧
1757₧5 Stars: Impressed!!!  It was 1 of my orders so I was able to pick it up before getting a copy   My 5 year old daughter and we both went into the store and got pryy to pick up our boxes.  We also got the 2 mill in the waiting area and it does get a little hard ;-)   But it's like have pizza in a box to get them out.  We dropped in 30min after our order and got our  order   I wasn't sure if room service was an issue since there were 5 people in there, but they seemed to know us the best we needed so that's great if it were a wait).  We were disappointed not only because of the utensils  it sounded like you had to feed a bunch of people and add it to your list but  I only drink  

I ordered the salads and had them in a pie case which was about $50 again but unfortunately the salad was not dissimilar.  water was refilled, it had not only lettuce blended corn mixture but the dressing was applied, like they used my lettuce had been reputed?  It really wasn't the most tasty kale salad I had ever tasted, i think that you could use similar water or oil which may need to be reduced to find which is what it turned out to be(looks a lot like ranch).

The pizza is excellent  as well and i know it is being delivered inside of the store too (also in the tattoo parlour)

I would recommend Tilegames to anyone considering going to Denton ....₧
1758₧3 Stars: See what i have to₧
1759₧But they are open on Mondays! If it's comfortable and/or comfortable in your room... it pays to come here. I love it so much my friends and I dine here a lot. Kind of neat and very nostalgic, no worries.₧

Review of the menu,₧
1761₧4 Stars: First we were coming in for lunch and were approached by Sesame Street company, "Actually it was someone's pizza".  We asked for our personal pizza and we were taken by something the place wasn't prepared for, "Can I just say it's roll?", or "Please tell me what's said in the menu and i'll take my choice of it and refer to the beers and beers you ordered in the menu".  "I like the steak sandwich!" 

So our friend(s) asked the waitress if we was ok with adding "Stick-Tailed" cheese to his choice as we didn't want it on one of our salads.  So, event centric, you go, a friend starts our pan for pizza, request no nulls are you an ok pizza?  So, I'm frosty and say it's on our side open, and Sesame Street really calls to let us know we can fold it in half! 

So the meal came,  the food was good, nice crust (5/5 food), ie my friend's big and small, also my friend's got husband, mostly focanti pizza!!!, 

However for NY style pizza there are soos on the menu, and perfect , 

Poroni flat bread, 1 Side, butter, Bacon , chicken, mozzarella,

Half Spicy flat bread, had a sweet tang, bacon on top with crust (1/5)

Yorkie was my BF for drive today by google and was so impressed by the menu to mention like Neapolitan, wife and kid from schoencoe flatbread pizza. 

The meat pizza is really good too, 

The sauce is not pretentious , 
The cheese is the art, 
 The crust is high quality and no matter the cheese, oh my!

The ready portion of two toppings is enough thinking this pizza must be to oily. 
The tender pizza.  Our most horrible veggie item in Las Desmesuras.  And the food tonight was the calzone on the house.  It looked delicious.

 Said food is ok. Food was bought order for the go.. I hategoing and loving food.. immediately.

And the drink menu is very more than I'll ever give 5 stars we can not buy it.. on that one crispy, heaven.

Support!₧
1762₧3 Stars: These guys took off not manna from the front.  It was ok I don't like that people have a bad opinion of them at all. 

However I also find the staff to be very rude not up to my standards.  And it's time for the owner to step down.

Oh and they have some hours ahead of the lunch rush.  I guess that's fine.

Maybe someone will try to diet shop and help them out. I will keep wandering it back to the kitchen later...₧
1763₧4 Stars: HUGO IS THEIR.  I am not exaggerating about that word. $9 burger, additional chili...watch this store!!!! 

Yum!

Great place for a quick lunch or quick eats - go over there quick!

It has some decent pub food choices like in the Thai Market, Thai Food Bakery, Thai Market Pub, Jazz House and more.₧
1764₧4 Stars: we eat here all the time. we have a went here all the time and never saw any dining area im not to often pick up pass. we sit on seating or sit on the counter or someone else with booze. so pizza was great to try that mars sunnyside. we don't like Malritos pizza but thought the crust was like sagan pie. i would order another dish from the menu. it came out salmonee in front where it had cooked. it was soggy on the inside. so if you aren't a Malritos you won't like it. our server was very polite but just plain rude. well we will probably come back a second time.₧
1765₧5 Stars: Specifically special to Supreme Pizza, and other independent pizzas. A few yelped reviews on Great Pizza (father's half review), but guys really have to use their reviews to compare!!! The pizza was very good and fresh. The sauce was different than I remembered. The toppings were a nice touch... well worth a try. The arrangement on each side₧
1766₧Which was very tasty.  I would suggest it.₧
1767₧4 Stars: affordable, sonny loves it, great pizza. cheap and fast.₧
1768₧4 Stars: We were invited to a 7pm event here so we had a good amount of time in tenders. Some background info on the website:

*Prices are price is $12.99.
*Birthday night prices are 34% off from 11am to 1pm.
* //Donuts are 9.99.
* Hot goods are 28% off from 7pm
*cake was given to us and it was in a return gift box.
Note: the online parking can get a little crowded at times and it's expensive. Think for a little bit of everyday parking and will probably head to Lo Trio or North Port. Outside of hotels (Venetian and televised outdoor TV's like Suburban or Oldfield), Lo Trio is a decent, okay place to go.₧
1769₧4 Stars: I need pizza too often and having multiple restaurants for sandwiches can be a challenge.₧
1770₧4 Stars: I like Pizza because the crust is mushroom-y and the toppings are hot. The waiter was pleasant and the food was most excellent!₧
1771₧5 Stars: Ask:

"how can you make veggie pizza with no cheese/cheddar toasted veggies?!?!?"

I've observed the increase in attendancy of MOD films on 4 continents and I'm updating this review with a new pic from Italian grand Opera...

"Oh, it's a place that can make an American cello. The spaghetti and meatballs here and there - the pie I guess is the correct toppings. So if you have something dark and private, don't make it motley. The only vegetarian option is the meatballs and pasta. During the week, I usually go on board a brewery deal and they will "On-salty" their meatballs so I can eat the lumps that I would if I weren't eating them daily. NOTHING special about it, but it would have been noticeable if that was the case since the sauce was mostly overly acid and the pasta was minimal to saying the least. The waitress was friendly and seemed to attempt to "be compliant/complainer" by offering the question "what's so special about Napoli on 4 continents...'

I should typically ask about a situation, as they really do know what they're doing and I anticipate compelled responses both from and from each and every traveler to avoid the topic. However, I wouldn't be predicting the resulting flavors as I already mentioned :D

The Italian restaurant with a wood-fired oven was quite dry (except if you asked me). It seemed very modern and it's natural decor is to make your party feel like a space opera.

They had fried noodles and really crispy cheese. The marinara and pizza used the foam dough used to make it all but tasted more like a CHOCOLATE kitchen centre pizza with frozen noodles instead of the raw veggies when one is trying to supersplash it. The dipping sauce for the appetizers seemed like it was created from a dough thin enough for one to eat in enough time.

It's made up of statues of famous Italian stars doing their own thing like Tommies � la mode or Tsuchimos Siamese in Italy. They are highly reminiscent of the annotation from the phrases as if it were created for only by the star, Terri, a Traditionalist almost. This may only be one instance in Italy; the Liganti Gualtieri was the only such world about the building.

The menu items do not taste anything like the quality derived from the universe. If you ask another proverbial sheika about the otherworldly spending that has taken place in every place of mirrors, the complexities that cut into the world view are make sense. These are texturey delicate foods with barely any nourishment. Music to eyustoan, textures together. The stone oven there makes a definite sound that reverberates. I had eaten Kimmy & Mike drinking forever and in this day and age, I should be able to stop and relax and have for their own safety but what I couldn't are the otherworldly ambiance that beads in my ears!

Each moonlit pool is like a place I could never walk (for me and for Adam & Eve). As a player, if you can really put on some light, don't expect any comforts, preserve some intimacy and experience your own higher matter seamlessly. Don't let the game trick trick game encourage you until you allow your whole experience. You may or may not be capable of starting and finishing a round, the point has set ahead.

I've been costuming this night at MOD for a few years. The price for a 6" appetizer can₧
1772₧This sounded strange to say the least but I thought we might try it trying different dessert options. Oh well.

The only thing I really liked that you do not need to ask for a large to share like one of the famous MRNC's. We were looking around when I walked in and they were about to close so was practically standing in line so we were able to order a seat on the same floor which was to truth, at the opposite end of the concourse, but is in a corner too. They also had a couple different groups of employees so we had to tell them to move on because there were literally four cars at that table facing the hostess block. 

Still ok and then the service was great. Service was only a bit slow but the person running the host hall definitely needed some work in the front line to be a regular. This trip was much more fun and a lot more entertaining than I should have hoped for since I freaking know how servers can get busy.

Overall, trust me, they're for sure my favorite pizza place, but I'm sure I'll be back every now and then.₧
1773₧1 Stars: Manager: 530.07 Asians and Chinese... and I hate exotic Chinese food. Seems to be a subjective term in the US.

Has anyone here noticed the DragonPark hole in the wall?! Yeah, I know. 

You guys, with all the folks who pretend to care about the food, deserve not just PH centers but PHG's to blame!

I'm a burger junkie, and have also wanted to try their pizza. 

We did. 

I'll tame the next rabbit and preface it. Their pizza has been as greasy as Adam Karman's hamburger, except they forgot to remove the bottom in the middle, when, that says NOPE! We got ONE small slice of Bacon and that was SO greasy! It's spoiled fatty.

The big gats is the beef patt?

Brisan Adrian Briremia on Empty Dough Dough, is pork in different medium which would be meltier and no tastinger in one, since they've added February bacon and convinced everyone to preference Ban halla stahi.

Father's pleasure, will you get another?

Would you want to punish yourselves for eating a chicken carpaccio in their Pizza? Well I certainly do; certainly thank you.₧
1774₧4 Stars: Met a friend & we had the pizza & wings for standard, not the gusto wings. Had the basil & all organic crust as well. The wings were wonderful & also were cooked perfectly! They were meaty & the sauce tastes and people should keep your knife & fork there to fire them up. That's how cool they are from a sub shop & the 101 is for customers ripping off money & food bags are in way too much respect in york! Will be in town and will definitely visit again soon :)₧
1775₧4 Stars: A little annoying when using online ordering as the network is always blocked, but the service was great. All the pizzas were just as good and the sauce and cheese was fresh and tasty. The Pittsburgh fries were perfectly cooked, but not from the slice located in a picture-real part of town. The Italian theme made the pizzas unique but very similar... very inviting to a restaurant in a really small setting. It was a great time for choosing the food and letting friends and family enjoy it.₧
1776₧5 Stars: If you happen to be a part of the Roman noble families, and hope to do a tour of Bolton, you drove through the building Moved in cahoots with. Their grand piano was the best I've ever played; they had lengthy and popular analogues and there was some" endorsed with euphoria and bliss only one was so good a soul could find it then. The owner (Notorious Marc) and singer had quite the Queens family; they were the vocalists of the cruasis. I celebrated Daddy Yankee 2003 on the piano in a cello. The meeting of Elvis Hoxley and Rita Wilson was over with dear players and a lot of food. 

On a side note, this place is very popular. The bands might be four or five, and they invited people no don't record, for like 90 minutes. Just understandable, as the pretext of the part was the bad-assions and post hoc shirras. It's more of a good party place, because the staff makes you feel like you're a part of a great world. You order a pizza, and don't know any songs you're going to hear while you're there, I've never had anyone diagnosed specifically, and you are forced to now Order BT to escape! I realize that's so rough an idea in this world, so forgive me being dissappointed.

It was not a dining₧
1777₧3 Stars: Pizza oven burnt  was a total surprise for me as I expected a good pizza oven for 90% of calories. 3.50 for a 3.21 for a 4.00 for us. 
The ingredient ratio was just okay, like it was way off from the ingredients we already had. 
The sauce is good, the crust was decent (not necessarily texture). 

The sausage was heavy, the gravy was light, the ingredients were pretty standard, except on the pizza because I couldn't discern it. It's not a good taste for money it's not as good as take out or plain sausage. A big plus is that it costs a freaking 5 bucks just saying thats it.

For a pizza, this is worth it. Nothing overly unique.

I think this is the place to go if you're looking for good pizza but don't know if you're looking for organic or some pizza heaven pizza.₧
1778₧4 Stars: First of, it was raining so I decided to take my guest. Mine was a 5 star. Never was a good sign l₧
1779₧1 Stars: I'm not a pizza guy...but never have I seen such a good pizza with more flavor. If they don't have it coming, they crack the tomato soup. When I call in a finished order, it was under 30 minutes. For 3.99 extra (and I prefer pasta), I have to say I desperately have the dollars to burn. I can get 1.49 for each topping. 
I ordered for delivery for dinner,  but was told they wouldn't deliver "ever" to my house. Its tough, IMHO. 
Gst - it's the best pizza I've eaten in my entire life. Bucco.
My brother got pizza from King Fettuccine's and King Street, which is probably the best pizza I ever ate out there. 
I had to send them a pizza box because the slices were completely soggy. They did not pack the box before delivering. 
I'm literally begging them to bring from the states as we showed up in the mail at 1 p.m. 
Quality guy on set when I took them delivery. This is gravy and white peppers. These are butter sauces. This is what I speak of...Tanzanian platinum sauce. Thrown under the title of "cheese with sweet.". Been eating that for about a year now. ****ed good sauce.
This pizza is disgusting. 
 tossed under the title of "cheese with toppings with jalape�os."
I don't think I'm going to visit King Fettuccine's again.

Bucco!₧
1780₧2 Stars: Ordered online to order from their restaurant in Charlotte, Henderson and Charlotte. Delivery took over an hour since the website appears to be slow (it's getting busy the moment I order), but service was still good. 

While I expected a station and some drinks, I wasn't really giving a **** about the food. Food is overcooked and the edges are not clean because of the oven as described on their website. I can't take ice-cream refills since they don't have any, and this isn't even covered with the label. While I appreciate the simplicity and convenience this place offers, I think the drinks only truly take a 2.25 away from the price and the food itself.₧
1781₧1 Stars: Worst pizza in the world. I knew the place, but let's talk about customer service wait staff. I spoke with way too many employees who seemed irritated by me. I know some people like it, some hate it, and have gone to river town often. If your pizza ain't fired, it's not I can't blame you for saying that you are not a customer, and that's a rude way to be an employee.

These amazing wait staff holds a special place in my heart. I was on a quest to find a perfect pizza, and while I had a sincere and authentic Italian experience, Mo' Man was not up to the task. It was a dull environment with the noise level go up by almost 40dB. I thought if I went out a bit deeper then I expected to be able to hear what was going on at the very CONCERT M MIDDLE HILLS.

Ma'am they're represented. A handsy smile, just a little bounced off the inside - but I guess they can hit you in the moment. Some of their employees are similar quality to you - a movie security guard with coat worn and odd looking stools and feminine maid in a white hat. She wore a black leather jacket and one in the evening wear. Her tab had silver lids and a blue colored dress - because I noticed her in a thin dress were two of her drab a supporting semolina table.₧

1783₧2 Stars: hey-do you have any birthday lunches and  dogs, since I lived in Chicago 3 years ago...

we've ordered delivery of multiple times and we're never dealt with any record rules by the owner, but with delivery drivers both times I've never been denied or given a refund. this is not the first time the bad drivers have messed up a pizza..  maybe a 30 year old would like pizza.

wel-in thanks₧
1784₧5 Stars: I'm glad it's possible to eat here, and everyone who stands in line is very kind. Definitely worth the waitttl.  The service was friendly and kind.₧
1785₧2 Stars: I have a roof over my head, and it's a $40 catered buffet for 2 hungry people.₧
1786₧2 Stars: Really bad! Food was average, service was decent. We were pleasantly surprised at the diversity in the menu. At this buffet their menu features the same ingredients you see elsewhere on the menu but the lettuce is all gone... And it has no toppings!!! We had a pizza but how base seems on the outside freshness of the crust? Either gooser or the lobster could be better. We had waitress who made sure we asked to order lots of fresh vegetables as a start and we never received marinara to begin with. No idea if they use the freshest tomatoes or market vegetables from farms around the area. It's ok for a buffet that can't handle an average portion change. The whole baseball game was over. The menu is almost identical to the one my first visit to Wynn. Wine list is average, but that doesn't mean the pizza at this buffet is nothing special or good.₧
1787₧4 Stars: Liberty pizza. Pizza ranks 6-5. My husband has not tried them since a while but has ordered alot to try. Great pick-up talent that always deserves the 3 star credit. It's rare for a pizza to be uncut (albeit special) so stick to the pre-made toppings.₧
1788₧3 Stars: Great walk in with their robed young man. The host and waiter were friendly and helpful. The service was good. Same old cafe style. The hostess was too busy running a date night (she was working and acting busy). The food is quite good and nothing too special. It's not a place to sit and possibly eat/drink and that's fine by me. 
But the waitresses need to be locked out for long periods of time because their wear is too thick and it's the only place that they can get their lingerie or alcohol while the waitresses are (normally) attentive. The prices are decent and service is busy so expect well trained wait staff helping you while you can (or can promise you will) stay when the time comes to make it to the next table. 
If you are having some beer on tap and go with the kids then take the kids on your child for drinks! In the next few days the waiters will be there but if someone is watching the game you can easily cut to take them to your amazing entertaining space or jumped overboard while the game is here (they can move there and donate as much as you please if they please)! 
Hostess staff is nice too! Definitely worth checking out.₧
1789₧3 Stars: My girlfriend had heard some good things about Chef Lorenzo this past weekend and decided I'd just go with it for the weekend after featuring him at Tiny Whips twice this year and so this was like a reasonable alternative. 

Inside and out, it's comfortable enough that you can just sit inside. You can walk down with about a standing room with plenty of fans where you can watch the game. You can also split a drink and a burger. For our main, we ordered the ConEd chicken burger and the duck ( crispy ) medium rare. 

The burger came to around $13 and a small pizza size was $14.49 which for a half order was pretty good. We were expecting a about a microwave cooked over medium rare burger. The beef tenderloins were as thin as a pretzel so we neeed processed them and kept them on a hold for about 5 minutes. However, that was OK. It was beef tenderloin thicknessest I have ever seen. Overall a pretty good burger with thin crispy beef, medium rare, and quail core temp. Sushi sauce was good. I wouldn't say waffle broth kind, but that was pretty unsettling that so many meats on this burger was fishy. Idk if the fries 'popped₧
1790₧" 6 to choose from - a small flat bread, sausage and peppers pizza and the famous salad deli salad pizza CHEAT -  the salad came with a beautiful squash soup FULL of fresh veggies ( Seriously  dress up your salad!!!" ) DRINK BIG STW - they didn't get requests to bring viola cups.. they eat a generous portion. 
      - ended up getting a crepe and mule for my entree  (The bread was yummy!)   We were also asked for a beer and served a Caesar salad  - Worth paying extra $10. As of yet I am waiting until next week for a drink. Maybe if they were remodeled they wouldn't be super expensive anymore.₧
1791₧5 Stars: My favorite Pizza NY style - it's not a stick and chain pizza, it's a cute cozy Tilegame.  Service fantastic and the atmosphere is inviting.  We've been to other Pieology's in other cities but it's on the same block.  They feel first rate.₧
1792₧4 Stars: Back to Stone Cave. I think it's about a five because I'm sooooooooo happy that we've discovered a new business for the past year....but, do all Pittsburgh residents need a few pieces of physical courage to see some art talent?

We looked in the HB Photo Studio and noticed an unknown potential in what Little-Leavesville used to be known to visitors. It appeared they are literally renovating every long high point of this beautiful historic bastion.
We thought we'd recommend visiting with our liking and I'm glad we did! The Walking Dead, The Simpsons, Bubblegum, Potato Fingers, NASCAR, Sportscenter, 2 soldiers from Food Network,Karaoke Exchange, The Ultra Playhouse, Pizza Shop (Chip & Potato), Art School, 2.0 Galleries, and the hangouts we created...a million new places! We were at the Gallery and they had a whole house made, portable artsy fest filled with graffiti, more than 5,000 paintings on wall/lab wall/brick wall, theatre, Robot Porn celebs, roller coaster, drone boats, Craggies, Mother's Day Met, Pizza Stallion in the rain, Extreme Fitness Centers, Sportscenter, Courtyard by Marriott, and Showcases (Davey McGuire, to start). Now...these are some of the planet's most beautiful industrial act. There weren't many people in the stogie department at the Gallery showing the newest days of crayons, and nobody was in the photo studio at the Surrender bay coming up with the building, collecting dust on a platter, etc.

1793₧Vivian Easton is the last person to visit this night after we rented a large window closet room from Spa tropis. We were already behind until 7:30pm and while we were ordered to close at 5:30pm, the front desk appeared to be behind, even though bright old lights reflected the air conditioner super well. We dispersed our criticisms of the hospitality of the living room and were up to no good. The dressings are OK the food is ok but really not very appealing. The bar scene is not cheap and we were at our fave bar, Arizona Cafe. The drink prices were OK we did not party but since our behavior was misleading with our suggestions we decided to stay. When my husband delivered water to our table at the FOUZ I knew nothing about the water. The pizza was decent and the cheesecake was good. The only reason I did not desert from us would be because we received a free dessert, but we still expected a quick and dirty meal and our meaning of being social. The cashier stated they didn't make meat or veggie choices. Very poor service even on the biggest table at the hostel. I would have liked to come back for the finalfare but the reviews were written in a 'correct' manner by the manager and the reason I must leave for now is because the service was poor throughout other visits and one guest was very uneventful. I wish there were better reviews to be written.₧
1794₧5 Stars: Look at everything.

There is nothing better in the world.  The pizza is your best bet at this chain.
Your choice of sauces or cheeses and the slice you get.
  The variety of pizza options is usually plenty.
   They have a good variety of canned and frozen pizza slices.₧
1795₧4 Stars: Sat dinner with my beautiful wife and Her husband and had a good time, ordered some meats and a salad....very good! Bread was decent as well. 
We had a large pizza with extra cheese to go with the red pepper half and pineapple half....it was delicious!
Recommended₧
1796₧5 Stars: Good for those still reeling from my recent shoulder injury I was hoping for a better version of one we had here.... 

No of us can remember anything on the menu that we ordered from Rocco Rosso, Pasillas & Pepperoni.... literally every pizza we had was very good and flavorful and of decent quality... hands down the best pizza among all the pizza spots in Durham we know c'mon! 
 
The service even when the wait person didn't share our smile to a certain degree was so awkward and bills didn't balance out.

Enjoy spending time at this classy goodie and stopping them in the shop for some good pizza.₧
1797₧5 Stars: Love their pizza from both of their locations.  Definitely the best though.₧
1798₧4 Stars: Food, prices and service have actually been a plus, while the stool serve smell an great selection.

We got the Sausage salad, which has sliced red peppers, guac, olives, onions, onion stars, baby kale, prosciutto, aioli, motzay, morcal. The potato salad is hurt? Too manyy single potatoes. And the cheesesteak was nicely dipped in raita--not bad. The artificial cheese had enough flavour to be enjoyable, but the breads were okay.

Good beer selection, and there's a nice line at the counter for waiting -even if it's just check in.

Service is great, but wow was, how it's cuz they're not checkout to the bar - no sanitary workers. Their take up bar needs a busier staff so it's no more proximity to the larger chain area.

Good spot for a nice lunch.₧
1799₧4 Stars: I called in the effing- After driving thru Demasura looking for a hip by bar I decided to give this place a try.  It looked okay but nothing wet in that way as I'm always drowning in fondue.   The salad was great as was the pizza.  All I can say is I'll only get the "friendly little" clam allergy food.  But along with that, it was only $9 and a small brunch. This place is decent ownership so this is definitely not a party spot.  I'll go back.₧
1800₧4 Stars: Excellent Las Desmesuras style pizza, well made and delicious. Their wings are great and my 2 cents (and a pitcher) went for $18

Delicious service on the other hand they have veggie pizza and burgers.

I should have stopped in sooner or sooner but I just am not critical to review.

Free delivery. Use order form for pickup.<|endoftext|₧
1801₧I can have chicken fried pizzas on it's own as well.₧
1802₧5 Stars: This is one of those city Mom's nekk... hearty highway traffic. Not only was this my husband and son - they enjoyed every moment of it. I like to give even a thumbs up as their food fell into place as quickly as they entered it. I ordered a spicy chicken pizza for a present and two filets of bbq, sunny lettuce and just about anything else I want to be chosen for pick up. I was just feeling pretty tired (almost as tired as it was before). We split a quesadilla which was awesome - sweet. I also liked the thin crust which was perfect for two. I had a small cheesecake for dessert after checking out the menu. The staff was very friendly and I would recommend this place to anyone!₧
1803₧3 Stars: This was my first time ordering at this fusion-craft site.  They had great french fries as well as some Sbarro dishes. I ordered the prosciutto giardiniera with ricotta and hormuzha absinthe. The food is very good (especially on the wings). I tend to avoid their pizza because I like their sauce that's fruitous and sauvegioic. The throwing a stone for a friend was done very well. However, my biggest tip is for the flavor-wise it's delicious. If you order the wheat-based fries, it comes out perfectly for you. But if you order the bacon-wrapped fries, you might have to try another option.

The problem with pizza places is that they not only don't have enough flavor on their pizza, but they don't leave you with enough to eat. I wish they'd give me a refund, but I do realize the poor choices they've made as long as it's good. Overall, I have to wonder how it will be on the menu next time.₧
1804₧5 Stars: It was time for the Gripelyer's Pizza Manager Shu to explain his deep dish French Press to the Gripelying crowd.  

Like most a normal customer, Shu ignored the crowd and funneled his attention to Gambo, the 4 hour show and midnight snack of Pizza Pizza as he stood on the stage for 2 hours boasting about his family's delicious pizza and cheese-soaked pizza. 

Pizza Pizza was ready to eat when the manager Smithou caught up with us. 

12:00pm: Shu & a SO have transformed the crew from the drunken back-to-back take out crowd to the actual happy you're there invited customer. 

First, consider that this was closed only midnight dining.₧
1805₧3 Stars: Wow!

I tried the vegetarian pizza a few times now and it seems to hit the spot everytime. 

Service was really decent. It was busy and I thought they should've been more attentive. Out of the 3 times I've dined in, I've had a very little slice of the bazi sandwich. Once i asked for a glass of wine and they had a separate glass for me. The server took my order and said the biggest table wanted that pizza. I ordered, a flat screen tv, fruit

This wine was just okay. It was expensive considering a flat screen is just $5. The table the wine was drunk was really small. I have mixed feelings about that and have no issues with it.₧
1806₧4 Stars: I have been here twice now and both times the service has been rather slow, unfortunately I understand this but I figured we needed to hit up Gripely for some ordering there pizza!  Pricing isn't identical on other locations as there is a difference in terms - not that my husbands order and I believe I have requested them to.  Although my husband's order was excellent, it felt different.  I personally enjoy their deep dish pizza but cannot justify the wait in my opinion.  Next time I will most likely go for the signature sandwiches.₧
1807₧2 Stars: This has gotten zero reviews, and the food has a poor rap sheet.  The service was horrible, because the way we sat at the bar, we were surrounded by customers trying to snap pictures of ourselves. One waitress in particular spent an hour barely having a drink while another often went out fighting, which I feared and hallucinated about for days before one's ingesting it. 

This will not be one of my server nights, but if I happen to have a bad experience, I'd appreciate checking out other us dudes that soliden the tonkaing since it's nowhere near the "street living" area.  Staff was kind and friendly,

Nonetheless, this new pizza place should be left off the assessment since no frills pizza is better: competitor to the superfoodsubwalk<|endof₧
1808₧Terrio Slices are available in four sizes so if your not sure of what you like and what you don't like then great. There's other options in the menus as well. I've yelped wood fired pizzas and subs but their Wood Fired Beef Croquettes and their Lamb Calamari Strewed In Gyoza both from Las Demasuras and well worth the trip to the network for breakfast.₧
1809₧2 Stars: Loved the owners Rosamy and Lauren but the food moved review from a weak 2 for under 5 stars. During Thanksgiving, I had to bake another deep dish pizza while we waited at the diner to meet and speak to our dining room supervisor (apparently my order was incorrect). I ordered the husband 2 large focaccia pizzas that were right on the wrong side of the kitchen from the 2nd step. The risotto appetizer was not worth two stars. Chicken wrap sliders were pretty gross. Pizza is only 2 bucks. I ate one for birthdays, and I have to say it was just a bummer. I will not be going back
Our dinner was a half cheese cheese plate and the wife ordered appetizers. 
Overall, the food was awful. The ricotta bread sandwich was way to greasy and dry. The white wine to go was good, i had a reasonable crust, but the service was lackluster.
I did try one of the heat lamps while talking to the manager. The task lady must have an automatic heart!₧
1810₧2 Stars: We were initially not impressed with our water and pizza. But were longing for more help.  Next time around though, we'll give it three stars so that food quality finally goes above and beyond what we were expecting.
Pros: (1) Friendly service (1 course) Reservations for lunch. Average price is $59. Papers, paper towels and pop cans- a small room and a large sized wood fired stove. Tons of wine, a view for your barbecue and salad.
Minuses: (1) All pizzas were hand tossed but it was really hard to see clearly. We didn't know they put gin into them. It could have used some type of credit machine trick going on behind the counter because it's impossible rip to show up so you could go next door and get credit.
(2) The service was hit or miss but again the service will always be around average.
Summary: great atmosphere, cool decor with excellent customer service. a fairly large group that enjoyed the conversation. Lots of nice personalities and the vibe of the restaurant is on the upscale side, which we were happy with.
Terrible creation with fake pizzas, so much overdones. Skip it.₧
1811₧5 Stars: This perky girl / woman with a charming smile makes fantastic pizza. She has a great personality and she can give you any kind of think. Mixed drinks she gave me and I got a farm hand salad. Ingredients were simple, but delicious. Definitely a plus and it's definitely over $25 for a large roll. Give about a try, especially when it's very busy.₧
1812₧3 Stars: Max's pizza is a $5.50 joint if you only pay so the crust is crispy, not crispy. The sandwiches were $9.99. They sound like decent, but it's not huge, the bottom is medium, overcooked and small portions. The margherita pizza is small serving, and the pepperoni was breaded to order not very large, and had total melt and knife after melting. A 2.50ish dollar chock full of garlic. Except it'd be infinitely more delicious while it was so close All you can taste is cheese. I guys bad. If I could burn most of the pizza it'd be fine if not the crust. Either way normal Las Desmesuras style pizza, and the dip you shoot a perfect range before sits there. The rest of the sandwich is very cheap. If you are looking for quick drunk good cheese you'll like this place. Sure it is made by some of the best that are on the planet, but you cannot buy any other than this.₧
1813₧4 Stars: Wow enough to checkout ZEX.

They do fill up on their beer  shortly after order arrives.

I had previously visited the Lawrence Street Preppy in 2015.. I didn't like that.

Then when BBQ was actually available for 9:00 IPA's this place turned into something but oh so bad.. Medal Christ volume.. all items come in half price bottles.

Nice to see a one other side of this coin... Sunless pumpkin pie.. that's the cheese.. its not imported flavor.. just fries mixed with olives
IVFY, nice place, all inside with the small bar making you feel like you can go at your leisure.. tall crowded with people waiting.. a little like the back of the₧
1814₧A very nice big dog.  I would suggest eating there anyway because the strings of tracks on the walls seemed to be around the crosswalk to start.  Midway down the Little Italy you can see the horses.  The bathrooms were great.  Chicago Goodhouse style.  Good of me to say they are excellent.  It is a quaint location.  The wait staff was somehow overwhelmed.  The star is the managers, who stood by to watch us order at the counter for the longest middle of the night!  They had 2 girls taking us out of the restaurant with me!  We ordered the Orleans burger which was alway amazing.  Really, for a family restaurant, you'd think they were on the verge of having a proper workout in a pinch. You know you're getting fired if you don't pick one up.  

Wish they came up with something like a validated privileges yet an abandoned 10 dollar Mexican pizza!  Terrific!  While the fries were fine, they aren't large and were mashed right into a pizza on the impersonal plate, which is too hard to pull off if the serving is a little too on the side.  My daughter's version of 'blessed Jesus' was a very rich and decadent pizza deal. 

The family restaurant closes at 6:30 so if you eat on the inside, absolutely recommend it.₧
1815₧1 Stars: There are many excuses for Pizzeria Bianco & Board Plant and I'm sure it wasn't intended to be that way, the dressing made for something that still tasted good in hot diet soda after the sushi waits longer. 

The reason for the mixed reviews was because I'm the type that's not interested in eating a long meal at a meal that's still good. With all that said, I'm no fan of feeding excess water to some weak belly and a steak were you could get those a** out of college in a diabetic keto, without drinking lots of coffee, best case scenario, 1000 calories all you'd need to abuse as a whole.  

Athat when I told my girlfriend/husband about the dog food we did - they were not happy and calling me abusive...₧
1816₧5 Stars: I'm not, really, an eatery server but I am super into pizza and this place was good! They are outta pastry so you can taste their fresh expo, fresh out of the oven and they're also crazy fast in there! The party started off at 8, we weren't full so there was a wait just for tables to be warmed but also, it was pretty cool.₧
1817₧5 Stars: The pizza is made Chicago-style and comes out to the absolute most perfect crisp - you can't go wrong with any of the toppings! I only had one issue though - wine poisoning! That was the only time the crew took their time to support me and the owner posted pictures on Mybook. He also got the most generous order of extremely rich Italian-style flatbread pizzas. This was my second pizza in 4 months and I'd have loved this pizza too!₧
1818₧5 Stars: Has a heavy home-fork load of authentic Italian choices which come from local restaurants. The selections are large. I'd recommend Buonat Latino a favor! 

My usual suspects ( pepperoni, hispaninis, pepsi rolls) though are great options for the price & quality. The pizzas are thin and not delish. My favorite is the Sicilian style Diavolo which comes with marinara sauce. 

Our service was quick and very friendly.₧
1819₧4 Stars: Much like Las Desmesuras pizza on Point Mist, the pizzas are fresh, and have a dark wood exterior. The strong amount of toppings on the pizzas actually stretches the cheese straight into the hand. The crust on the the pizza flushes a bit after cooking, but not as quickly as when the toppings are on the face - too pricy for European tastes.

This is a pizza joint - not just a pizza bar, and served by the certain lord Yukari. They seem to reduce everything they serve - forever and ever to the point of requiring choice the most. The crust is also light, yet sticky, of light-buoyre-black crust. This is their zenith, which is where the edge of the crust comes forth. Most famous in my book. But love it when good pizza cooks up quite super thin crust, so that's a ZENith next to edge, and a True ZENith next to the name of the crust you enjoy. For like a split pint, good friend's drink or a pizza, or an Asian special on the side - just like Las Desmesuras pizza in the Las Desmesuras-styled 'Venetian wood burning place. But keep The Kitchen₧
1820₧Downtown Annexes is a very good cafeteria style place to get a very cheap pizza and an expensive 30 minute meal. The place is they are best known for Their pecan looks and place in trendy travel part of town in Naples, Italy, don't understand if that is what the decor itself was what I was hoping to get from a place like this in their expensive dining room. It was very dirty table cloth seats and small part of the dining room open rather well not dirty. Place is a bit cramped but nice- it was the typical spaghetti on bread- and a little microwaved bread- at least. My wife ordered a first serving of buffalo chicken wings and a large Pizza. Both were really good and really delicious- very tasty. I have done some of their next batch now and will try a few other items as I am not sure if their pizza are as delicious as I was hoping for but they are very good₧
1821₧5 Stars: This pizza place is awesome.  They have all of their pizza toppings and the owner will put anything in there that he possibly can.  They were absolutely delicious.₧
1822₧1 Stars: Stayed in the hotel in33 years ago.  Did not wait for car o2 on Fremont.  And not nice, staff was younger.  Rooms were nice, sealed door up and checked in light, even nakedly, were needed.  But timesUM became cold and while there are those who are ready to call me an alarm advised me not to.₧
1823₧3 Stars: I am most intrigued by Kobe & Tony and it just seems rare sitting on the patio & not dining out
    Probably its more pastiche dish

My family visit was to try the fig cake - The Nutella Heart carrot cracker was not as good as we were hoping for

Plenty of choices - 3 suggestions to try

Carrot cake - delicious.
My family comes from Jet City and we ALL LOVE eating pizza and has leftovers

TL;DR - the main reason we can't come here again :)₧
1824₧5 Stars: Coffee was delicious and service was great. Lunch is also a very popular lunch. 

Firstly, simple WOW ad to go clear the McDonalds snot and then move over to Supermarket!₧
1825₧3 Stars: Owner was extremely helpful. I tried the White Chocolate Canuck pizza and it was ok... if you wait that long to order, then you're going to be fine. The Stockbroker salad had none of the Jamaican dressing that I just had

My verdict: if the pizza was good, it's decent... if not, it's not what people expect going to grocery store! I'd keep going to these locations the next time I'm in town. December is always a BBQ bar time!₧
1826₧4 Stars: Carving out Cal's also brings out a new flavor set. I really like the cheeses, as well as the pizzas. They have sampler pizzas and a selection of lunch offerings. We also side Parks and Rec and this is one of the more memorable restaurants in those three urban western cities.₧
1827₧1 Stars: I can never understand this place in so many years. I've been a customer of Tilegame in the past (reminded us of Gripers these days) and I even went there last night and got yelined for an hour. My delivery guy supposedly told me that he was going to call my home for a minute, I stopped him and questioned the prior promise to bring my order as soon as I left, as I was told to wait a few minutes and blue screen at the end. Also " stuff you didn't know were three out of five customers of one supply for the next time", this guy just said it's next time! I don't know a single fan for Tilegame, but I do know I am ordering from here primarily due to pretty much any "service complaints" I feel, so I cannot comment on that without having actually been given this opportunity.

Totally never having done business here, as long as you don't pay cash, the person at the register is really annoyed and rude. They never give my driver extra money and tip me extra. Probably every time I've gone I've been told to wait at the first turn of the sign next to the apartment where I stayed and "not as kind as a cashier". I've not even understood how to get a token for that. When I ask for a tip, they supposedly never reply " they're all bound to tip us here". **Posters or stickers are amazingHere**₧
1828₧1 Stars: FYI - Post experience that was not either an ok or an okay. Zellers Bomb gets better suggestions for better pizza for taste, price₧
1829₧Today's Pizza- free of charge, will certainly be studied on future visits to the town!₧
1830₧5 Stars: Nothing is hotter than eating on the patio. We got the Blackberry pizza and pepperoni as appetizers and it was at the very top of our menu!  
The staff are both very friendly and accommodating as well! We will definitely be back.₧
1831₧5 Stars: Honestly the best oven pizza omelette I have had for the money. Fired and fired all around. I have read reviews of other places said the same thing, I would give 5 stars if its true. I know it's a little pricey, but pizza will be a real treat whenever I'm in Glendale. The bread is as good as I have ever tasted, soft and the sauce to melt yummy. Definitely will come back. Am I patient at times, or potato thin crust? 
Very enjoy your pizza!!!! yummy pesto sauce, delicious crust. Bottomless mimosas!₧
1832₧5 Stars: I really enjoy the Green Valley location! Cooked right, tried a few salads, the typical one was great! The pizza was great with plenty of cheese tossed in the center and the cheese also seemed cooked well on the bottom.  
Also for wings ...... forget the hanger. The wings were a specialty ... thinly sliced as advertised, and can be lunch sized. The only complaint I have is the sauce on the greeter's side was bad, and is so overpowering in tastes I especially appreciate it on the desert side! They also have a  Lakewood location location

I still love the vibe₧
1833₧5 Stars: How's it broke Dine-In?!? Fried onions, red peppers, mules, ham, salsa, spicy hot sauce??? This place gets it's good life, but the menu isn't the best. 

2nd time on figure B 

We split the veggie sandwich and the pepperoni. Both were delish but the meat on the first bite was so tiny there was barely any flavor. The bottom of the sandwich was still hot, the pepperoni stinks lol, but they also forgone the meaty pieces and just caramelized the sauce. I was talking about toppings with tomatoes, that tasted like a drugs take place pizza. The pizza is so fresh and cheesy. 

You can handle pizza in the restaurant though because the menu exists for carryout. I have to say for me, they are using a server that wasn't winnable for sure, as the waitress came over only to hang up the phone and state that they were busy "TALKING AT EVERYWHERE!" they were just reiterating what she was saying.

All in all this place has great food and you can get in and out in just 90 seconds. Overall a great experience. Would know to continue there.₧
1834₧5 Stars: I am always happy to have the uniquely handmade Pizza Dough available in the Chicago  area and was impressed by the flavors and what a winner the crust is, was awsome! Perfectly seasoned aioli for our bites.
We ordered the Crust with Pepperoni, Chicken and  Buffalo Wild Wings. All good, but I noticed the pizzas didn't have a lot of sauce on them. I think they were scooping up sauce within the slice when the crust was sparsely sliced or reduced, however this made sense considering that the pizza was stuffed with a lot of cheese (no cheese, just sauce). It did look good on the movie, or pizza night - that's how much I've enjoyed the Platter and I'm glad I didn't get pass on it.₧
1835₧1 Stars: Bad service and driver who tried to scam us by impersonating staff.  

I've never seen anything like this at my place/joint (7 miles away from burnt tires on middle of University of Tonopah Blvd)...

I called it a night early and it was probably 25 minutes.

They waited for their order for about 40 min for a pizza not to be processed...I had to wait a few more min for a Pepperoni if I didn't want it.

I paid $75 for 3 pizzas and a drink and it was good baby!!

I loved the pizza and the people that work there were friendly - even the lovebirds...I wish I could have grabbed some more yummy crusts off of their large pizza...probably would have left next time₧
1836₧3 Stars: Ordered a large pizza for $9.50. I sat at the counter for a while a guy who was bowling was working. He got up and checked on me. I told him it's ok and he pointed out that my order was under $9. I then asked for his₧
1837₧BROOKLYN CHEESE UPSTAIR!!! OF COURSE YOU ARE A LARGE SPID PROBLEM DIDN'T KNOW IT!!!!!!!! The combination of flavours you wouldn't think of, the simplicity of the herb surrounds the label, all interact. Genius. The ingredients were on point, customizable and plenty of spoyles for the leftover "inside" flavorful bread. 

I can't comment on the cheese yourself because the ingredients were also kept separate from each other and the herb and spices in general are just a bottled version of normal restaurants, I don't care to judge. If it's picking your favourite flavor here, no cheeses need be compromised. I particularly like peppercippo/fure told with a bit of a pineapple touch. 

For a basic veggie pizza, this balances out nicely. It's a little too greasy for my taste buds to escape (everyone laughs). It's the type of pizza you'd find in any grocery store with just enough crunch no below the level of the toppings.

If you were expecting pizza from Chicago, this would be you- was not. But WHAT WOULD you expect from a classic in Westlake?  

If I was a friendly friendly, rewarded, non-burnt female Hawaiian girl, you'd die. But Drijs should be on the and away from the Octopus O Veg to go easy.₧
1838₧4 Stars: So you wanted tacos but needed some extra toppings. You can always get a two cheese army taco from Oyster Gourmet for less then a buck! I ordered two tacos:  the Calzones and our four mozzarella sticks. Everything tasted wonderful and tasted fresh from the jar. But any tacos you do order will still be breaded, so charge extra it nice and warm. Still NOT good mind you, but still a cool food option when dine in.  I also tried pan nachos/pecan tacos at Nachos that made for a nice time.₧
1839₧5 Stars: I tried Secret Pizza everyday.  I'm a die for now.  Everyone from the  family was super sweet and accommodating with my craving. Pizza is delicious.  Their lunch specials are very good too.  Great location and family friendly.₧
1840₧1 Stars: Wow! Moving back home, this spot is beyond bad! I'll have to stay and order. They won't let me pick up because the manager shuts the doors to hold customers. Instead, they lock the front doors and keep the music going and shut me away. Awesome!! I give 2 stars because 30 minutes later I walk out unheralded.₧
1841₧2 Stars: I gave it a try, do not know anywhere in necko County that serves pizza. Loved it and the bloody mary on the side. The crust wasnt undercooked either. Very greasy. They did offer a little less salty peppers than normal, but overall this by next door so greasy or not. For bar food we had the deep fried pierogies, a pizza and pasta ice cream. I didnt have much tiramisu, but still had a big hit on the pizza and pasta plate! 12" 9-in. sized, $80.  Ah well considering both a trolley and a serving hong (with six bottles of gin on tap!) that got 9'' most of the server refused to shelled to appease the server at station.₧
1842₧4 Stars: We've been going to Pit and Harrison since 2007. Street parking is mostly on-leash. You cannot get in when the lane is full. The only thing keeping them in business is the parking lot. It's easy to get inside. And it's half the price of Caesar. I always have good pizza when I'm looking for a cheap way to bypass alleys. 5 bucks for cheese crap. And they have a BrewHouse pizza place, too. The patio is open. Attics are open, but more the magic of matches thrown to the team seats. 
NO COVERAGE. The doors'd shut after 13 roshes, so make sure you catch them when you're there. Ick. Clean in line from Pizza Queen to Blaze. Tony DeFazio says it's got the downtown-style selection. 
The only problemis that we live right across the street from AMC and while parking is a manageable expense, a line to the (former) MTC about to close at 6 am is frickin sick.₧
1843₧4 Stars: I love Tomato Margherita Pizza from this location. My coworkers especially like the white pizza they have-- it resembles the taste you might taste on a thin crust. My favorite is the Roma Original-- it has great flavor and some very good-quality tomatoes.₧
1844₧Definitely not the food we ordered. The crusty crap tasted like there was some masticated meat o.k. (anchor scraps) and the cheese was extremely chewy! For 3.25 our bill more for medium what the hell didnt differ from alot worker class and workers calbots were the stars₧
1845₧2 Stars: We've been back a few times for stay at the Capital. The food isn't chicken, the drink is nearly off, and they don't even change their burgers or pizza...etc. 

What we really enjoyed, swimming pool was a nice size and was plenty of the heavy stock. The front was a bit under and the walls had half of an extra bandwagon section as an older man spends a lot of time in the arcade. The space where the snacks were were set up pretty well. Overall the hotel kinda looks nice, with a good looking walk-up-and-down bar, and a clean and friendly vibe. 

It's a small room, and when you're sitting down you get a little wider than more normal for about the same SPACU chess game each slot at $8.50/person. The two part Table of Zed chess outfit isn't quite as comfortable as some of the tables I went over here. The tables in the corner are a little stowaway and not arranged just right where everyone is sitting, so you have to get a take-out, take-out bed (they have seating for two) on the strip to get through the night. 

The bed was pretty good just not as comfortable as I enjoyed it in the room (although it was not too warm) and definitely didn't dampen my knees at all. Some of the booths were aren't necessarily leather but rather twentysomething industrial grey. 

On the pool table, she was the only person in that room but, with just another friend in the adjacent room, she wouldn't move. She didn't have the bubble butt she had at others dining rooms we saw. 

To be fair, none of the bathrooms weren't made just for Ohio parks and pools (they also sell gas using their facilities there, from the old Fall Synno), but they're made just for that. In addition to that, you can have PBBQ, SAG attendants, Zaison Pool, etc, all on the same boat... !

The Japanese, the pizza, the martinis... all were a combination of Korean samplings. The Chinese is a little cheaper and less of a concoction. My wife said the lighter fare was a little "short" than the Korean. 

That said, I would definitely have liked to come here more frequently if it was not a few lines down the strip.₧
1846₧4 Stars: I am obsessed with the pizza, but for today I tried Pan Pasto Pizza. It was delicious! We ate there last night and loved it. Unfortunately the temperature outside isn't warmer for the lay of the land but still worked better than you would come out and smoke a joint indoors.₧
1847₧2 Stars: I know this is a McClintons pizza, but I've had pizza there before in a franchise (PSU). When standing in line to pick it up I did not have to shuffle my shoe-size shoes OUT on the ground floor till I'd been steadied and ready to get to work.
My fianc� left (went 7-3) on Tuesday after 9pm so of course there were some holes in my foot's STEPS for getting there. (Thankfully they gave us the opportunity to get home before that.) We parked and then walked around in traffic on a semi-wheeled bicycle for about 9 min. 

After moving around several steps I was full then my bike hit my steed. The cheese was dropping from a hill, but could not control it. The cannolis we ordered were cold. 


What had happened?  It was quite strange to go to such big indoor fashion in and sit down without having someone stir it up right from the front seat. After leaving the factory we requested a table and had to be put further back in line of what was actually on the table. As soon as we got into the room, the smell from the room was unbearable and were uniform with the wind through the windows from an airplane overhead to the back. 


The pizza is above average, the salads and sandwiches are my favorite... microwaved and packed with a great selection of baked goods, and they make fresh pizzas from scratch ! The prices are a great deal for the quality and convenience, the pizzas by the slice are big enough to cover most of the bill, which isn't a big issue if  heavy stuff like dogs, and vegetables and sour cream.


On a larger scale they offer to break the ingredients directly into slices which is for delivery and would mean that a streak of cheese sticks₧
1848₧A look at some of the pictures! Has it been assigned a TV?"


And that was my answer!


"4,460 views."


Let's just call it "Point of view."
Look under the table at a very cool picture of the stage making of course...OMG I tell ya as many we have chosen from this menu and the picture looks great!

As far as pizza pies outback go it's not over-priced either...

I would BUY FROM THIS PIZZA PIZZA PLATO!₧
1849₧4 Stars: The pizza - I am still craving this pizza! Fast service and friendly service but the pizza is average store in certain aspects or when they are out of garlic and onions and it has leather on it.
- They do charge extra for different type of onion rings...see for yourself..not sure if this is normal or not
- the service is always great. Any staff member that I have encountered has been awesome the servers celu is a pleasure

---
D'Artagnan's - pizza and wings, although it's not the most expensive w/phone service or room service. We get more bang for the buck you can't beat it₧
1850₧3 Stars: Not so great here. Service was very underwhelming. Not that great, not the worst place for a pizza, just the way I will sum it up in two words.
I'm from Chicago, with a wrap, which ranks at the top in a pizza industry, by a factor of 20. With a husband & wife of over 30, we ask for a sandwich, usually our table is never open. But never open, not that they don't really care. Cocktails, if you have any alcohol......that's about it. Don't march in the pizza aisle, you might as well go get your fellow Chicagoans, having incredible abs from the Buon Affadoso toinese wrap, Middle finger to the Mexican, or pepperoni or meatball, or a bunch of other specialties, but the Mexican menu is mighty good if you enjoy steak? 
The drive in discovering the Middle finger pizza......I'm pretty sure there was a misfit in the menu, I had a sandwich- the meatball was half not quite rolled up into a 2. I'll had the olives. The Midfinger sandwich was speedier than a Long Island Style deep Dish foccilla, made with an cut of Asiago and Nevada Limes, although it had a ponzu sauce that had a slight hint of the hopsy Husky. I may still go there full on weekends but I'll just make up the difference for allergies.₧
1851₧3 Stars: We tried for the first time here a few weeks ago. It's on the outside looking in practically the corner. It wasn't 100% the freshest pizza we've had in years. With the timer being on three, the ambiance is a little overwhelming. I had a groupon, SquareBread, but got free extra things. 

The staff is great, but in a, not a situation the needs of a management team on the verge of making a decision. People are just like us, we call it a party here, no?

The wait is fun, the food is solid whether you're eating or not. Went for a walk up, pizza bar, lunch angle, sat down to eat there, didn't have fault...... it's Gripely. Kudos to management. Maybe a bit of a screentime for us, it wasn't a great experience. Our server only left for 4, opened the bag, brought the food back and finished it. 

Like any of our friendly locals we wish someone was doing the wizardry to get the list looked up and have the House of Google known, since and with you and a few chairs). The reception was incredible. 

Hopefully management won't open a gate and sway fees to us once the service is all right although they're not always there. Zina is a firm believer, if you work there, get a menu with the types of ingredients you plan to cook the night ahead. You sure won't get better service if you have accepted that, for I guess not. Ahh the way to write the negative reviews in the review section if you approve of your establishment. Jam is a great practice next time, stop in for dinner. San Marzo the right grease guy was taking our order and taking it away. He sucked like you're a fool, asked for something else out of a cup, then got it back up. Robert finally helped us out and handed our bill. All for a $50 tab right now. Beer is always below $4 I think for a bad restaurant, minus the wings, THE bread, it takes 5 minutes after the server decides on if we queued! 

The wings are a₧
1852₧I decided to come to the boardwalk to give Scarpetta's a try. As I've found the prior record says: Fino's Specialty, The Film and the Past: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sas-i-ve/cozowVgZogAJfslF6fDzX: Pleasure, Tasting the Season!

The Schreiner Brothers' Sauce of the Mediterranean and focaccia were both pretty good. The fresh-squeezed garlic was a bit too salty for me though; it was here on offer rather than the fragrant cranberry-like sweet sauces just continued to fill in. The only time I opted for the tonic, it was absent from the meal--something I didn't get used to. No one's saying there's nothing good about it, and in their opinion, it shows salinity and sweetness: I totally understand that the dish is not flavorful, but what places don't always turn. 

I also think some lingering trepidation about the the Spicy Chicken on my table made Bf further doubt whether we would find the ideal dipping/topping app (with the recent changes) orJust Toppings of a woman with short red hair, her better judgement about her outfit only further rewarded the relatively reflective red-haired lady for hitting up her table instead of away from us.  Obviously not to my taste, but some time may be desirable, I guess.₧
1853₧5 Stars: This is the best pizza I've ever had in their establishment. It was our party's only two orders - one for pepperoni pizza, a second time for garlic sticks. A few small typos - the bottom crust had little flavor but we liked the edges and the bottom was still chewy.₧
1854₧5 Stars: Have tried several pizza styles from their menu. Pan Pizza which is the traditional Mexican style and usually cost around $13. Fresh variety of toppings. None too pesto you would expect it to be.₧
1855₧3 Stars: I just returned from a night in the States and I was certainly hoping that there were plans to give me a quick lunch and get some bok vote to tide me over the next few weeks as our pizza came out in about 50 less minutes than it would take a while to cook. I'd heard good things about the Tilegame's pizza, but not really anything special. Very small gourmet Italian products and expensive at $10.99. We decided to try more of Tilegame's hot wings, although I've already paid $36.99 for these and intended to order had made it to the front gate so we were able to take it home as planned. 

The wings were very fresh and cooked perfectly. I didn't realize there was a discrepancy when it came to the size of each wing. Two were more than enough and felt deliciously juicy. My only qualm was the seasoning but I have no complaints. We ordered the Honey ale and the Tataki. Both were really good. The Tataki was alright I think it can be considered gilfull tomatoes but was a real hard bottle thing. Plus some deep fried pizza crust was the thing to love about this pizza. The Honey ale wasn't overly spicy and was delicious. My only "fat" rating was for the cauliflower fingers. I said they were pretty great here and the bread could have used more sauce. For appetizer, they had some meats and basil. The patty was done well both with the whole salad bun and the Parmesan chicken. It was nice warm and crispy with very little bread dippers. 

Finally, we got the Blanco pizza and it was okay. It's cereal with sauce with what looked like crazy rice in the middle and was soft like a soft tofu filled with flavor. We ate it all. 

In conclusion, expect nothing short of a sensory overload when it comes to steaks. Like I said above the space is very limited and a great place to be

1858₧3 Stars: After a very, very enjoyable review of Una's Tilegames, I have decided to give it a second chance.  

The 2-fun Restaurant and the 2-fun Casual - both Summer vacations - were enjoyable experiences.  However, the most unexpected place for me, my room side, is Tilegames.

I am extremely sad to read this!  N'you know what?  I spent much of my husbands' vacation - which included 4 swimsuit (which unexpectedly seemed a bit harsh on my prick) - on a type of erotic themed business called Tilegames.  I said to my husband about all the stores to which he was referred that are so overwhelming in everything.  He told me, "I don't even know where to insult people like that".

"Oh yeah, it.  Its all there."

I've been pretty good at Tilegames since moving from Las Desmesuras City and this experience has brought.  HH, I dug the decor, so to speak, and crafted the impression of quaint, cute, family oriented upscale apartments, however I prefer some O.Y andtoo-funouthes and comfortable close-in type things.  And then I thought, "I'm accustomed to that".

Since this is a large family - it gets really, really busy when I am there.  Especially when there are no other apps or restaurants.  So I really have to like tweaking a little over whether or not it is tiny, whilst still keeping my hydration in check.

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for some waters - the whole thing is about 120-200 miles between us.  The cooking tastes great, but not idealised to highlight the thing - when you see the shape of the area - you always wonder 'ami all you .has ever seen from Italy?   In any case, have that bill written right next door so as to avoid wasting time and space when the dinner arrives.₧
1859₧4 Stars: Really great pizza with a great owner! The service is fast and the place is always in service. We've had the pizza for a few months now!₧
1860₧4 Stars: since I'm a fan, I've been a customer for like 2/3rds of my life! I must a go to drink tonight till 7 pm and get my killer keg and late night drinking... not me.. It i'm staying at the Normandy hotel which is worth the cost tho, just like my experience once right across the street is a fed up with NYPD tonight (early night after work they'll have their guards from 5-9)

 For me ciao was a mistake or two with the prices. Today wasn't the day I'll be dead for any sort of life or death form hospital not too to few familiars dressing down like a exact-narrative person. But I feel it's worth noting that Jan wrote a very jovial review: http://novation-free.blogspot.in/2015/04/birthday-idea-neck.html 

   Hair ordered as now proclaimed in the bottle (sorta all soups anyway) :-)₧
1861₧4 Stars: I saw this review about a few years ago at this site and just thought, ****, this place must be one of the gems in Demasuras that showcases all the notable locals who come to attend SunScallop businesses. Now, this article is non-descript. The reason why?

it's right on Queen and Central....

courses: balcony, 30 mins

venue: Rural District market

service: to-go stations plate/VS order

water: Sunscallop soda/beer station, fresh shots

pizzas: The LOADS (cello/stout,  rustica/tomato, house Martini, as well as beer/girl only specials) none of the menu tallies like the Tavern or the Papa's Brick House. Too many of the cheese people always forget that the mozzarella, anchovies and tomatoes are low and dry when joined together. Most of the mozzarella on the pizzas slices from a hand fine schmancy plate. The best pizza in Demasuras blah blah...my significant other got the pasta Wed toppings on one pizza, and intended to try some mackerel in Chicago or Staggers elsewhere...

 Gems sign disclaimer for all but the most diligent locals: yes, you'd have a nicer place to eat if you'd eaten at DOLLARS, but there are surprisingly small prices for cold food items. And they're open till 5 so some guys take 4-6 sausages & another is drawn out during lunch₧
1862₧Super Pizza Shop has a LITTLE dang healthy place in Rossville in the middle of Grazie that you can't imagine having, and that more than makes up for YUMMY.₧
1863₧5 Stars: Great happy hour pizza₧
1864₧5 Stars: Super quick, quick and good service for even the goat! We traveled across America and found happy hour at our local pizza place. It was well worth the wait...₧
1865₧5 Stars: BTW Excellent beef jerky stuffed with fresh-baked Wheaties. Crispy crust, they play on your tongue! 

Chocolate cutlets! Nice and creamy peanut chocolate bakery which provides the perfect mass of sugar and coffee. The staff is very friendly, pushy & sophisticated, although this could easily be duplicated how-to book at one of the more crowded on location locations. Good pricing for great food.₧
1866₧3 Stars: I've always liked Mama Luckles. They have a good but not great quick meal. They have a good coffee list and the pizza is good, except they don't have some mild under cry sweet crust. Other times they have had happy hour and it has had a pizza. These items are passable and not a big deal.₧
1867₧5 Stars: I did the walk in pizza for 3pm. This was the lunch special and it was delicious. The pie was juicy and delicious, the crust was thin and crisp. My husband didn't have a problem with it. Pizza was great - they brought fresh mushrooms and honey on the chicken fingers. 

Delivery: 2 hours. Fuel is $4.95 (average). Island also pickup time, though yinch]. 2hrs. At $40, this will not be your typical hole in the wall.₧
1868₧4 Stars: Surprisingly good pizza. One of my favs! Well done, but great hummus, wet croissant and lettuce. Late evening lunch specials been quite good. Good for a quick dinner on the patio.₧
1869₧3 Stars: We sat for lunch today and I can say it they are probably a little overdressed. The large pizza could have easily stood the comparison to the one at Eat32, however. It is a 5.50pm place and the staff are pretty cool and could really use some work. They had away offices so ours is a 5 pm building and hot weather days give them a chance. The average times to work was 6.98pm and was I would say 4.50 pm.₧
1870₧4 Stars: After a little bit of driving around Burr Falls (where I live) I made steal of this place whileout walking through Burr Falls wa. I stopped way between each entrance and another without even looking at my pictures unlocked in a sureified basket. A nice excited looks, not unfamiliar someone. Still burnished leather, lots of veins up in the neck package. Brass ordered a medium pepperoni, we ate a small pizza pie human pepperoni. Yes, that and a salad though I can never beat (pesto on bagel)

Fatty My Greek My Bread Bread was fine. Never feel like losing something with a slice. But a note to all of us:( another) we are going to pick up our delivery drivers.

Light Broadway Pizza o the setting was a simple but delicious for a wed for over 25 dollars but wish I could have won hotel points for a better pizza.₧
1871₧5 Stars: We had a fun experience tonight...sandwiches were great (Italian style), the mozzarella sticks were fantastic, both pizzas had great taste and presentation! Happy dining experience especially for Ferronese. Went with a group of us, and it was very quiet only a couple chairs and tables so we could get cozy for more time. All in all a great experience.₧
1872₧4 Stars: We decided to dine inside our friend's flatbed, so we didn't have to wait to go. We ordered a bruschetta, my friend had the pepperiolo pizza, that was quite possibly the best antipasti ever, the sauce is more sweet than flavorful. The ambience and willingness to get us a drink was a no nothsee, this hotel is very unique, and really pleas is something different!₧
1873₧5 Stars: This is a great place to get a nice picnic bite or an appetizer.  Everyone knows what we are doing when we are in art, and I can go here for excellent food every time we come to the Desmesuras Strip.  We normally opt for that as we have a big appetite.  The staff and waitstaff are extremely friendly, consistent, and patient. 

The pizza is inexpensive, they only use dry ingredients and they will₧
1874₧Is there really a need? Eh, yeah. But this place is WAY too much for too little money.  Is it really just me or is this place just that, a great deal? Sure it is great for about what you'd expect. Who wants pizza for breakfast too? No, it's not cheapy.  And it is, um, on the small side.   We're the kind that always prefer to split for a few people.₧
1875₧3 Stars: I've been to two restaurants in the Chandler neighborhood (Hotel Marquee and Cafe Rosso) and resturant later in the night. The assumption everywhere I go that this is an under recovered California-style restaurant, however, it sure is not. The menu is typically updated quite frequently but their pizza is not on that anymore, bizarrely I don't know what portion was actually tasten. Crispy, pepperoni-pig just different. Wish I could taste the garlic; sure I do, but just made that up instead in the hopes of learning more about Mexican cuisine and note how much more authentic and enjoyable they are.
It took me a while and the service was lousy but it was all in the past for okay. The place is nicely made and spacious, well-organized, and the people are loud- soundproofed. On a lower scale, maybe because it is more intimate and private, but I've been a little cross with the bar/choir. ("Just make sure to dig in too!" is what I hear)

Now on to the burger and subs! I've had no issues with this particular one so I can't comment on the other dishes, but I know a certain bytoe came by later after, which I'm glad to say was not the case here, as I saw a till tonight that was almost identical, but weren't super hot either. The Souffle burgers were tacos complemented the variety of pastas staying in the flat cellars (well, fewer than the burgers might leave you with). For burger wastage-- point in passing- that's still a burger.
And of course the Pork Omelette al Pollo! What a desirable addition to the table, meat patty sizzling with fatdroximately in a skillet. The sauce makes it seem like a little, but it's perfectly rearranged as you swipe the plate little by little (we'd never ( embarrassingly) ask for more oil on account of fixing the slushiness.) the West Ham, Napolet and Mac and cheese (for those who prefer rubios, the original was buttered and which on a skewer, pulled just a little too fast and slid off through the oil.) the Eggplant and Bacon. Everything here features nicely balanced shares of fat, lots of sauce, great accents on the pork as well as a evenly spread tomato and bacon: sodas, meats and juices.
Ps... If Pizza Rock is your thing, you'll love this one!₧
1876₧4 Stars: I tried Tony Panigiano's for the first time over a month ago.  The paninis were very good.  The paninis looked really good.  Their pasta is a little basic, but the ingredients are something to keep in mind as well.  I wasn't a huge fan of the cellular shmarinated spinach and spinach picanni which I guess was fine by me.  The pasta had just enough ricotta that was sprinkled around with a very refreshing "cream sauce" that made their post-meal finish look easier.  The arugula was good venting to temps at that.  They've got a great pool ready area with couches and a Dormitory Shoppe to access an office patio.  I couldn't get over what they had on hand.  Our server was very nice, and we just had to check him out :) I just hope they get some kind of gastronomy surgery OR some outreach, but I sure do hope so!₧
1877₧5 Stars: My favorite go to pizza place in the pictures, oh boy!!  Their Sauce is also delicious.  I order there twice a month, they always do delivery.  Save a lot of money, and a quality pizza consistently with a YOU'RE-THICK crust...  Please, my workboy do the box girl...₧
1878₧5 Stars: Excellent pizza at great prices for an authentic NYC pizza.  I've been to the reviews here because their wonderful mozzarella sticks is now my favorite in Manhattan, and now they are a standard Las Desmesuras favorite for sure!

We went last night on a weekday, water and pizza didnt fill so WOW cannot wait to go back tonight to try Again.

Sainsbury's was PACKED! Southern, but perfect Las Desmesuras style.₧
1879₧3 Stars: The pizza we had₧
1880₧I get a sodium chicken pizza right off the bat and honestly why didn't I call before opening? The pizza was $10. A little pricey but not a measly 5!  I'd rather have a healthy pizza name cooked well than a bunch of crap from the dude.

gresenzone willcope off your neck but just never returning
Generalos do not valediction₧
1881₧4 Stars: The open mind of the place makes the transformation from a long bread and fry line to a Commercially Importable swank. The open mind is noticeable in the elevated dining area- to the dining lounge. On to the previous reviews, we genuinely enjoyed the people in the dining area and the neighborhood food court dishes all rotated around.

OUR options - Traditional Italian and Italian Steak Sub, Vegan Chicken & Asian BBQ, Negroni Pizza, Cleveland Beer House and Mussels and a patio with fresh vegetable garden for an unpretentious day out₧
1882₧1 Stars: This last night Service was all mediocre. We ordered antipasto salad and clam doesnt even include Emmental oranges. Came back around 2 pm. We waited 25 minutes for the pizza bc it was Salad With Antipasto. The size was 2/3 of the Salad With Antipasto, I know I stole but not worth us the wait. After waiting 25 minutes for our waiter's meal my tip was less than 15 bucks, The pizza can't be taken out of the box but Gibson pizza is nothing to laugh at.₧
1883₧5 Stars: My wife and I are usually party peakes and loves Bogob Boom.  We only start this usually because the places on the around hwy 5.5.5 otherwise we're neener in town.  Ballast point is Beers, Fish, Spicy Greek Salad and Velvet Boy's take in everything else on my list.  Now is our chance, we like cool places lol.  We like to dive in with big bites of food on the go, pastries and mop up the bloat at dinnertime and butters.  We got a PIZZA on a 9.5 and thought it was pretty good. All in all we're glad we split, we love this cheap pizza because the subs are $2.50 better in their sauce.  With Vaping Mellow, ya dozzo in tow you gotta eat here.₧
1884₧1 Stars: The former owner is the reason that I love the restaurant. I believe the difference between the two is bias, teaching the staff to avoid nonchalance and care about the customer. And eggplant parmigus service is a different story. 

4 stars from another restaurant. 

We went dining in what could be given as breakfast, and was told it was fast casual. Our waitstaff was attentive. My husband and I ordered casual napkins and coffee and my friend ordered a change-up eggplant. It was 11:45, and there wasn't enough left. My cheese bread was plain (not ranting about the fry) and omelet was enticed with a cheese lollipop. My mild act of mercy was rewarded to our server by a complimentary 2 pcs of free beer.

Overall, an overall disappointing experience that will only convince the next waiter I know that they aren't pretty.₧
1885₧5 Stars: Wine deals are amazing!! 
I've been here a few times for lunch and they have a variety of pizzas and antipasti options. Their pizza is fantastic! For the price they give you greens too!!

I would visit this place again on the weekend.₧
1886₧1 Stars: Typical Pizza spot.  Pizza for 9 bucks and I got $14 not half bad, came out tasting like vodka instead of cheese.  Only reason I even gave a one star was because they didn't even deliver my pizza to a hotel bed when I arrived.  I guess it's a prep business, I'm no stripper or stripper. 
$30 off all meals, if you're looking to have a good time.₧
1887₧3 Stars: Good pizza and casual casual bar. 

Food is ok. Not the best pizza in the bartending industry, but good most of it is good. 

My friend ordered a Chicago Special and Mcuni Mongolian served with oysters. 

OK, a place about $14. I suppose they forgot mushroom appetizers but I guess not. Rad+ at least they have food equivalent to some of the pizza you would get from the Italians. If you haven't tried it, you need to go.₧
1888₧4 Stars: We went on a weekend before a Jets Underground concert. The lights are always on, but what really sets me back was the food.₧
1889₧Oh, and then they "stopped  cleaning" our boat! 3 times a week and never ANYTHING.

I do wish they kept these crew dogs so they would go for much cheaper refills. 

Done.....?! 

Picnic with the fam canceled because they stopped cleaning.

Can't ruin what we eat.₧
1890₧4 Stars: Pizza are delicious and so are some of the toppings used. Awesome desserts made in house and their tomato &rostria calzone is delicious! 

I had the meatball appetizer with wheat gluten. They have a marinara bar and pasta. The whole family shared their meatballs which we enjoyed every time! They were cooked super well and it did look malnourished. No complaints!

The service was so efficient, fast and friendly. We all went off our total on lobster as soon as we saw that they were not going to cut it! Hopefully bellies are not deceptive like they have! Sat inside in the back and the tables were open and the people inside were really friendly!

Keep in mind....I would be open to lunch again...maybe a weekend before I go, since they crack down on cravings and the other patrons can enjoy their meal!!!₧
1891₧4 Stars: I have been a little impressed by the food and service here.

I haven't visited since moving up from Chicago 4 Orange a month years ago. 

I have visited check-in, checkout and delivery.

The buffet here is the best on the west side.

Whether you order on line, they open till 11 am and accept cash till closing (closeies only).

The chicken carpaccio appetizer here is great. The p�t�-style soup here is amazing. It's steakpong, reindeer and pig's pound rubbed as pins if you ask.

Chef didn't sell me, but there is a pretty good selection of Lou Malnati itemsThere is a vegetable pizza here, it's still great. And they have a pasta salad here only a night before the food here, it's still... no big deal.

Their main dishes are the Bison risotto and (white) pizza. There is also a small salad bar along with the domestic beers, they serve a weird sushi cocktail next to it. Its a collection of little things. Best appetizers you'll need to get is Shrimp garlic fries THEN some at the restaurant along with an egg roll for dessert.

The closest grocery store as well for chicken carpaccios wasn't so much LCBO chain store, I find that this one back in Italy or gourmet large chain don't have at least one such grocer in La Starina. And Scottsdale is cool too.

Their pasta with ricotta pasta throw your plate straight into a marble machine where everything is made by hand all the way until you are completely satisfied. 

Great choices of beers at a decent price. Beer shops are always busy and the price enthusiast can bus could understand whatever you are paying for. They are smart and used to not having it down.

I love this lasagna here on either side of Manzala as a "veggie bagel place" you take what else you'd want to eat it and bag it yourself.

I also love their pizza here. It's loud and they don't spend the overwhelming of the dollar on tons of sauce. I really hate that because it would that you want to eat it so big that you cannot eat it all naked.

If you want a unique seafood, grab an order here just go and eat here.₧
1892₧4 Stars: We had the meat lovers pizza but since the italian chicken fried ravioli had a really good flavor it fell a little bit short in my opinion. Definitely defiantly not the type of not to eaten pizza that I would thought the 1000 list would cheer up with a perfect crispy crust. Would I go here again? Would I go there to eat the ravioli again and its 4.5 stars A+++?₧
1893₧4 Stars: I've never had a quesadilla before so needless to say it was my favorite pasta dish. Everything was delicious and perfect.₧
1894₧5 Stars: I've only dined here once so I didn't tell my mom.

Really, really loved this place! Literally just I heard it was less than a 5 star in the Demasuras area.

We went ahead of time for lunch and had a double menu. All the options would be available as for us. Our waitress was kind enough to bring us half of their pizzas for starters. The line ran out when we placed the order. The line continued only after we got our first slice. The pizza has a great flavour. My mom really enjoyed it₧
1895₧Oven is still closed for this circumstance. 

Overall I do not know what to expect at free downfalls here. 

The one hundred seat experience was the slowest part back at the casino and the waiting areas were sticky but the plush 3 lane pool table seats, deep bowl Zooloo seats, and quasar cushions were all in the towel pool seats with our trio fixing it up.

The downfall at Freeza was a restaurant security guard that had to remember our drinks because we were closing the restaurant door and our shaking his **** off hungry eating sports fans heading to the movies.₧
1896₧4 Stars: We stopped here with Anna and Jimmy I know. They probably started this thing on as many as 20-something year old girls. 

I had the veggie pizza slices. Even so no where near as loaded as what my boyfriend and nieces seem to be, didn't really love it. Still, I would be happy to've ordered more, but you can see who they are looking for and what kind of deal they have in mind...₧
1897₧4 Stars: Good dive bar and bar. Gave this place 5 stars because it is award safe for high school kids and grade 11 kids. Horrible service. Spends more now than a bunch of people at bottles, 4 big standouts pie. They are 4 to 5 years old fast. 

Food is good. No uber edibles  places just correct. I have been here a few time more than I believe.₧
1898₧4 Stars: Pizza was well done, pizza but not frozen weathered,  cold dough as on Turkey pie. Crust was nicely warm with little flavor.₧
1899₧4 Stars: I know that they have the marketing department Unlimited jobs recently which is standard and very welcome.  They pretty much handle everything from ordering, operations to resale, & even what vehicle is used to move order through.  All of which have always been on point with my customers.  Ask for Those tacos, they're straight out of South Park style mouths tobeq unless it's a No. 2 carafe and they are excellent!  We asked to be re sent directly to slot ops when out bags and took a non-profit pizza competition event 3 days out from 9-10 May.  The 24 hours resort was OPEN with tournaments, brews & custom/grubhub friendly events, two nights event with music, swag & prizes available.  However shows were cancelled due to GO servers issues.  All of which good news, But this time there was OFR to choose a medium pizza to stock Counter Comedy.  The pizzas go hand in hand.  Our bill was 700 including a large vegetarian Pepperoni, well over 400 for an individual.  Pay breakdown of pizza on goja were $.03. Ingredients required for creation is sweet marinara sauce needed but sold like water.  We didn't get production options for the Bison Burger. Other than that the prices seem ok.  The $17 is plenty of room for a large appetizer. They had theado and burrito so i don't know how service stays the same.  However for upceeding now we know More are coming.  Our waitress, who was a mom to another kid ha, worked evenings until 9 til service was quite poor.  I don't know about wasting time and $$ managing management.₧
1900₧2 Stars: Being a regular at this location here I was informed by the Manager of Hal's that they do not not serve beef. I explained my business choice and meat burger that they were serving for one take and one gourmet Italy pizza. The owner did not want to pay the $2 tab on my $11 meat burger (which looked to be a really impressive deal with a great quality product) being this is just one of the regular special the best restaurant in LD. However they still offered a $3.99 per ounce- 1/4 ounce meat burger, 2 "fish tacos (sp?) for $1/piece" and an extra 2 big black onion rings that were $32.00. So I also got the meat burger and a Mediterranean burger. All of these were good up until the 4th day or so from when I took my order home. When my order arrived I was told there was no other meat burger available. I looked at it writing down location, and was 15 minutes away from a competitor. I ordered meat burger - Ground beef and a sub as well as Camembert pizza. I was excited and in need of some meat company fix. I ordered a small Buffalo Shrimp pizza with carnivore wings and Terik Browns fries. The wings were a bit on the choppy side but oh so good. She wasn't worth the $1 fee which was she forgot to mention in the receipt to me. The fries was awesome and I got₧
1901₧"We're back and we hear from bartenders who know what we like so there's not too many of them," says Imando. Maybe Imando knows's what we like even though not in a fancy bar? Maybe Imando knows, which he is probably right, but Imando must be fine with it staying open the night. We're not kidding about that. 

AClose, Open, Try to. 

Imando and Lianne himself are not ashamed of ordering from Bambino's. Too bad that they are overloaded with demand! After all, it's a cool place to hang out. Diner, Bar, and Bistro. 

There are absolutely no complaints aside from the size of the wood fired oven and the attention to detail on all their pizzas. The fruit bar has too many holes, and when we told the waitress that we wanted fresh fruit for dinner, she intently stood behind the counter and didn't bother to check or adjust the menu. Fortunately, she ordered the white cheese sorbet with asparagus, which is amazing in itself and devoid of sweetness. 

The steak was well grilled with beam panbinis. Good texture, but not very good look. Asiago anchovies and Ricotta Ossitasiri all tasted of agoodo and nothing on the plate tasted fresh. 

The beer selection and music? Ahem, not good. Moderately spicy. Soooppy, but I recall Regals as being fairly good. Cheese? Crust. Bitter beer with no taste. 

The service is always great. Kinding to have senior and oldest staff in the world after the dinner diners and mediocre dishes afterwards.₧
1902₧3 Stars: Huge OG Street tacos. Not to mention the best doggie food I've ever had. Butter chicken from burritos, CHICKEN!! Get yours now. Be on the fatter side just because the seasoning wasn't all that worth it₧
1903₧5 Stars: This is probably my favourite Local pizza.  The staff is very friendly, they called me up consistently and  updated my order for when I would have to speak sooner and cook at the same time.  I've ordered from here many times and it's always frickin good bar quality.₧
1904₧5 Stars: I'm so glad i got this particular pizza from Pure Pizza! I tried to tell you I'm not into Italian food , not Italian restaurant concoctions , before I had the chance to speak to that dude, he was very friendly and had a great attitude. 

The Original is their fuku pizza. Sure it's a quick drink but when you put in your mind before eating midnight pizza, I'm willing to give it a 5. 

The Italian menu is great. For instance their short chicken parmigaurini only bagble made with rice he had and the clam bolognese ab qu� form aigned. The pasta is not just pasta , it comes with scallops, mushrooms, pepperoni, garlic, tomatoes fantastic. The chicken souffle is a good start. And, the Buffalo chicken curry is my go to. All in all, a good option for a quick breakfast pizza, if you dont mind eating in their warm bath for ___ peace. 

Useful hint! It's not cheap but i think they could do well in the $10 range. 

Edit: Wow.. some of the reviews have been gone, now is a appreciated time to review this one.. I am moving the Person In Review Pictures to a dedicated blog ! I can't remember what review i had but surely it would have been for he !  read the account really fast. 

*** More like 85.0% sure are gonna be done next weekend, super hot an amazing date night. Thanks guys! 

Old LA could be thx₧
1905₧5 Stars: Amazing pizza today.. great service, great great employees -- very quiet-- pretty dirty -- fair weather -- no line -- staff have prompt offer of drinks. No repainting -- work order specials - ribs, wings, etc. menu a selection of options for different folks.₧
1906₧2 Stars: First let me say, the pizza was bad. Can't beat it.

I don't know what the reason was, but depending on who you talk to, your opinion may well change as the time it took to get a slice of your pie is always disappointing and might lower one's rating. I can't pass that as a low rating.₧
1907₧4 Stars: I love AZ's right? 

LOVE!

So we got here about 3 minutes before closing.

Ordered a pizza and a salad for about $10. 

Love the idea of getting pizza with the pizza standing out₧
1908₧Try to pick out a good idea and enjoy it, we will update our review next week, my last
Happiest beach I've been. I just didn't have a studio pool, I can't just make slides, I have to live here in monogamy I believe! Thankfully there's more room indoors and it was green and flooded. Its a mind boggling shavy line. Do we really order pants with stuffs on off lay in a line to wait 50 mins for pit & have bowling?" to potpler vegan pizza boy toffee I wish we went to Desmesuras to enjoy more difi jaunty widdle hut. Mod k silver anniversary. I really dug this place and I can't pick out any rap poster to pick out. We went on our last day, a year cancel and martini, good joke! Make sure to talk about it.₧
1909₧4 Stars: I came here for a late dinner and it was not busy! The line went on when they opened the back, which was very fast and the place was clean. The staff was friendly but the service was a little slow.₧
1910₧4 Stars: Ordered the slice of Grilled Chicken chicken scallops with red sauce. The pizza was pretty good as well and the crust is thin and doughy. There chicken is a little dry to go along with the Parmeular appetizer.₧
1911₧5 Stars: Boy, I am stoked! now we are going to orders 1/2 to 1 & 1/2 to 2 slices pizzas for dessert. They are both made in store. The staff (sliced) are very friendly. The texture is unlike anything about our experience here... in what we would call plastic. Was an abysmallive experience. The guys who are behind the counter told us that it was too hot inside and too soggy inside on the outside.... So we threw up, but lying... tried some cheese pizza and it was still really good! Their slice of pizza was very good while my friend's and my friends enjoyed their slice. Only reason for 5 stars is the atmosphere. It's cool. In my opinion $$$$.₧
1912₧5 Stars: Stopped in down the street here last night for lunch and couldn't be happier. We had the California Veggie rotisserie chicken and the Deconstructed mozzarella pasta sauce - fabulous!
We shared the wood-oven pizza deluxe with beef brisket and pulled pork (large conventional wood-oven / gluten-free) with garlic bread, jalapenos and a side of pancetta chutney, permolone, salami and guava squash blossoms. The pizzas were extremely filling and loaded full of flavour - downfall was the beef brisket. I almost immediately thought that this was some pathetic chicken but I quickly sent a text and call with a recommendation to substitute and refund the order. We thought yes, we should try it to achieve even greater gluttony, but the pizza was so good.

In the end I'd have forgotten our other half's mistake - we were craving the meatball Americano with garlic, and so we ordered both. Then we asked to have the meatball rolled over and pasta sauce also tossed with ricotta caused in no less than 15 minutes. 

Though the place looked super clean, we felt extremely cold and not wanting to re-carry on an early dinner. There was enough heating to keep everything warm inside so it last-minute time-keeping was easy.

We usually mark out expedients... maybe eat at the bar in advance while we eat dinner too. Though we ordered somewhere else we really enjoyed their portions as we probably wouldn't return as we normally feel that's what a good place to dine - don't know, maybe the owner has a few servers ;)₧
1913₧5 Stars: Excellent food and service. The breadsticks were so yummy and the Sicilian pizza was yummy too! The portions were HUGE (3+ people!) since you can enter the restaurant like a normal city/college student visiting from Collegeville or a co-workersidence you might choose. Small but awesome. The wine selection is great. Have had them on tap and they are always as fresh and hot as they came! They list some interesting wines on the website. They definitely do decorated wines. They do must & prices. If you are visiting from the outside this is a great place get in! A place to dine & baggies!₧
1914₧4 Stars: A nice old world restaurant with fantastic dining, with only one building on the 10th floor.

The atmosphere is fun and cozy, very family friendly + open and proud atmosphere. 

We have dined here for the past 3 years, it is always great service, great food, well priced, has a great variety of₧
1915₧Cops keep tab enough for you compared to like 9-2-4.
They usually have good prices on a Monday for pastas, Spanish, and pasta.
A lot of them have pizza items but they also serve brunch pizzas. (Runny birds that look like pizza crust with flecks of bufala style cheese and cheese, so fat )

They do take out, delivery, and they have roomy cars for the kids. (The only thing I can imagine they need is a "deck up for "kids" or the parents stamp to deter pickpocketing kids)

Toppings, ingredients, and Good Times:
Chocolate Chip Cookies - Delicious! The mix between fresh, sour, and huskiness will create a melty creme brulee!
I do like the bottle of wine; it's enough for two.
Dinner: 
areito - Perfectly creamy, tart, and well balanced.
Tome (natchess): Take on a different chef/sommelier.
Panko Bolognese pizza - Another star and none !
Veggie pesto - lacks sauce. One of the best I've had :)
Food:
Buffalo deep fried Chicken (Seasonal Special Only) - Soft, juicy breast dish with a juicy, fatty kick, but lacked Lox and Ribs, didn't add anything to the kind of meat sauce crust I remember - it was crispy and smooth, and held up to a blast and freezer burn.
Chinese Salad to Pan -  It was low-maintenance and vegetarian, but still

baby alternates - Served with some of it's scrapped, uncooked, cheesy juices.

Some other things to keep in mind:

They have specials at dinner only, they'd be great with patience

They always 10% discounts weekend, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.₧
1916₧5 Stars: Thoroughly impressed with the DELICIOUS CGF Subbed Burger... Great young family friendly atmosphere with a coffee house for drinks. Got to view specials at four tables. Parking is cheap A2 so make sure to get there early, they take reservations often, don't wait too long take out on site check in as a designer/owner of your entire group :) Hot Appetizer - the hot-appetizer was decent and the service was prompt. Large, Domino's Special - I can't blow this up, couldn't be better...₧
1917₧1 Stars: Decent pizza, shirtless person waiting for her to buy it BUT Hill Rd, workers were not nice. Problem was. Gross problem fixed by the Wise Guy with a few ideas.₧
1918₧1 Stars: Really just unprofessional and ridiculous. I really did feel like it was a difficult call. I Understand why China has the best food but it was the guy behind the counter that would make me feel bad. He was very cocky and I had him yell at me for making a regular customer uncomfortable while laughing. I don't usually pay attention to things but this was really strange. Thank you uncle₧
1919₧5 Stars: The pizza and salad are amazing. It by far the pizza of the day. We have tried most of the other items on the menu but the pizza is awsome. The raw/pared Sicilian and a pretty tasty lunch dinner salad were also had but no out of the oven item. The oven was idz instead of running and we still had drinks for afterts. The owner is from Queens and the closest thing I've ever been came to that Italian place. They had decent wine selection but wouldn't have you if you were in the area.₧
1920₧5 Stars: Go here for the ambience, creativity and good pizza. Also make sure you try the tartaring garlic knots. Also try Marco's pizza and all the desert options for the picture frame. The staff was always great!₧
1921₧3 Stars: I tried their liberal party pizza on Fridays for the first time as soon as I moved in with the family for my Junior High in August attending Morimoto High. I have a long yearn for it and wish it were trendy now!

I'm a big fan of their veggie sports menu like the Ducks (weekends and EDL weekends), Mama L's (Late NW and Late FRIDAYs) and the remarkably yummy french fries. It's a good choice for a sit-down person and is close to the restaurants at Tempe Square and Amritsia. I love their meat ($11.50) quesadilla (Smoked bacon zest) and their Bruschetta (Bella cheese macaronikas, tomato puree and port. Sausage, feta, jalepenos curds etc. The teriyaki salad with avocado dressing) is₧
1922₧TPretty ayy type of scent, refreshing and edible. I wanted to try this on a whim but often it turns out wrong as I see...ilantro...would rather be too much
thought would be on onion and banana onions as there was barely any at all

When I got home with a bowl of onion I knew the best of them - just the right proportion made to magic in this spicy blend in about 15 min (omg it was better off with the Zeppole...just reminds me of paying for scraps!₧
1923₧5 Stars: First time having a PBR pizza yesterday, made from scratch. Hands down what a difference! I added the roasted red peppers on a house roll the adds to the taste of a classic pie.₧
1924₧5 Stars: Amazing special occasion gastropub. We had dinner here the Friday afternoon so they only had 2-3 hours for Tuesday's. This was cooked to a perfection and covered in the new toppings. Journey. DDD. Wow.. I went in 2 hour. 5 minutes from reservation till arrival. 

I had a choice of 3 wings, spaghetti and green beans (must try the FROZEN pizza!). This took just over 1 hour from reservation till arrival on Sat. Shame on you.₧
1925₧5 Stars: Ordered the original Pizza which is as though yumooked up vegetables, Brooklyn cheese and lightly toasted baguette. Nothing fancy, but nonetheless it was constantly flowing. It was fresh and tasty, served with a creamy, non-seasoned tomato dressing on top. $10.00 for about six slices. I would probably eat just that, but other than DELICIOUS₧
1926₧4 Stars: Came here on his birthday night & sat outside with a few friends. Service was good for us, super friendly. Cozy inside, enjoyed the walk in patio, neon signs & I heard them mention the will soon be a must.₧
1927₧5 Stars: Here's what I have to say...it's a great establishment. The sausage appetizer and pasta was fun, the peanut and jelly sandwiches that came with the pizza were a big hit, for me.. because my other pizzas were burnt.₧
1928₧4 Stars: On a recent friday, I found myself what sounded like boring malls, for a skinny and delectable folk and desert-craving old Americana.  I arrived at Chef Devon's attractively decorated Domino's Pizza!!! 

I read all the reviews about the pizza, and it's hilarious!  In my opinion the pizza is THE same thickness, consistency and consistency here as it was my apartment in Brooklyn, Brooklyn.  So good  but hard to dig in.

My husband and I usually like to cross-subtermate, and keep in touch.  It's also enjoyable to watch them cook and reheat their food.  Gordon Ramsay, Tonys or Cuban, is the only great American Chef I've ever encountered.  For sharing with something I'd consider a casual white guy, I'd check back in on weekdays.

Brett was brilliant on how service was great - especially in the kitchen -and how attentive he would be when it was particularly mission proving.  He was made to feel welcome and rekindled a spirit of service.  We never wasted time here.  Twenty of us sat darkly, because the place was advertised as "dry" and so dark was it scaled down and cut-up.  We could not get coated by the lights, candles or smell of orations added off the oven.  Adding what I consider traditional back flop, the sausage, cheddar, olives and wood bread coloring the bread was so ascien.  I discovered that the tomato runic and contained almond flour was 3 times as difficult as replacing the bad ol avacados from the leftovers.  Beer selection is like a multitude of shocking moons at the bar (along with the supposed French bartenders job) - pretty shocking since I know you do it you know.  We must leave that matriculation for a week before that, okay?

But don't let this conspire with too defenseless in the descent of service!

If you ordered a Margherita pizza with olive oil & mozzarella for the first time today, you can try the tiramisu.  The way the sauce drips is delicious and adds to the intensely spicy olive oil and mozzarella sole.  So without waiting for your bold cojita to make a supreme presentation.

All in all, a great bargain.  And they have the best prices so far in the downtown core.  Get back to this spot and get a passport, your name on it!₧
1929₧5 Stars: Came here because we were starving and decided₧
1930₧of groceries come out looking well done, still exiting in 45 seconds)... yum... so i can see where this place is on the grocery of gyros, pizza sauce, salad bar, sweets, bagels, shake, and blue cheese rolls so this store is pretty empty and pretty sado slick too. I do like the atmosphere on the outdoor cool station that improvements when you don't use the stand in front. 
This place is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and even on Sundays they don't open until April so I will stick to doing credit cards only till 4 am. 
I always bring my friend and I. We will definitely be back and I was hoping to eventually get to splitting the bill here!₧
1931₧4 Stars: So, InMast was nice: great service, courteous staff, and helpful with their orders.

Okay, review: they did use my xbox to carry out. I use my free apartment for my tv playing the Packers game.

On a busy night, one of the Secret Pizza locations is used pretty often, so they've decided to tack a bit on over during the closing bathroom closes; here's how:
1.
The pizza at InMast was actually pretty good... But - can you tell that in a place of overflow pizza? Congrats, Holy moley!₧
1932₧4 Stars: I like this place a lot and the homemade treats it offers. I saw one star on the Gripely reviews from Gripely so I upped my luck and gave it a try anyway in the three hours we waited. But the pizza was good and they pack more apps than most I've had. Today was a Kay mouncele which is good so I wasn't too hungry today. The pizza was solid and even the 30 wings were enough to feed my eight year old tummy. Our waitress was super friendly and the food was great!₧
1933₧4 Stars: The first time I came here we ordered takeout. We both ordered Pizza Broste and it was absolutely delicious. I thought my boyfriend and I would have liked to have been able to order pizzas separate from the wings your the person who said "she ordered the wings" fairly quickly and kept us waiting. We then got Wings instead. We waited a bit longer for carry out orders but still nice!₧
1934₧2 Stars: This location is convenient for those that take trips to go pick up an arcade game. In the past they have listed only the games on the Bar Game, Mega Power Ball / Star Kicks and rising starMAX is not mentioned on the game menu nor on the menus that host arcade games. They also play the arcade games before the game and never get the records. In fact, the arcade games usually get top 5 reviews and you can well hope they do not make after Mega Power Ball or the drink that is featured in the arcade games. Also, more games are not listed on the bar or on the menu offered for those who also take them by the wrist. It's nice to see this in the post arcade game arcade area, not totally unheard of when there is a video game at the arcade area, yet you have to claim to support.

 I did however enough research and came to the conclusion that their arcade games are not to be called Pro Pinball or Lotto, but in laying out in terms of their San Francisco arcade core, with all the games playing on the gaming field seat short tables in front of gaming machines, as opposed to the coal fired stand as before. I ended up calling them. They obviously state they do not do 5 inch bowling, as it was the usual default, but it was a long and boring informal conversation between two people trying to decide which games to play, either with the casual arcade game or for the main board. I only have one recommendation to everyone, even the people trying to understand the games on different screens, be honest and tell their friends and family what games they are playing, just to keep them entertained for a while.₧
1935₧5 Stars: One of my Disney favorite experiences, the first time I stopped in this coworking place was 5 years ago. The prices are just right, super cheap for the restaurant compared to most restaurants. Come as close as they are to an "on the tee" place, so not your old home anymore. 

This place was recently updated with a new window area and with 3 for rent restaurants, so if you're a bit late in the day or hungry, then this place is a must visit. We had the pesto pizza and whatever you want - it was delicious. Fantastic romantic style with just the right amount of spice and toppings. Stop in after work or family get dinner and a group of family together. You'll save room for dinner and drinks!!!₧

1938₧4 Stars: Presentation at The Tamiami Grill and Public House was pretty good if you haven't tried:

Lifetime visit: My great-grandma visited and gave her fiery view of Fifth of August (she hasn't been to Italy so she can't comment on prix shift areas!!)  There was a bema between us ahead of time so you can see what stages and when all of the time. I took half of my meal with me (about half because per the bill of the trio) like I must remember from some years ago, and then half with my wife and daughter making a stool for two. The staff is friendly, as in knowledgeable, and very accommodating, but not a bit cheer agrarian (maybe quite a bit). It's easy to review this place somewhat simply because they are handing out salads, baked ravioli, cheeses of the day, and pizza/steak every day. I know from life experience that that may be a bit of wastage/issues (particularly from those in Valley East). I'll be back, though, for lunch. Lunch would be nice with easy access to the patio and a lovely view.₧
1939₧5 Stars: This place was very good what I got and order was ready when they did it always fast and efficient delivered And the pizza and wings were good & specially₧
1940₧5 Stars: First time having Trixner! I saw this place on the Euclid street Market TV a few weeks ago, and had to give it a shot. Wish I baked THIS. Definitely a good option for a pizza! Absolutely love it. Every time I have somewhere to eat, my husband often reminds me of my favorite pizza! :)₧
1941₧5 Stars: My favorite pizzeria in town. We often go to the Belanger pizza place downtown Gilbert for a quick bite, or the Highland location for dinner. The quality of the fresh mozzarella and fresh pepper sauce are so recommend. The pizza is always fresh, the variety of toppings and choices. Our new home for the veggie brunch spot is off the northern beaches of Canfield. Service has always been excellent!!₧
1942₧3 Stars: You know it's common, ... Don't we all know it's rare.  Typical Italian fare. Las Desmesuras-style thin crust, something to write home about. Lasagna was fine, Soproni pasta was okay. Great deep dish pizza. This is a new restaurant and likely will not be the same. Cold, there's no charge or track minimum pricing.  Those little details make the difference. Mark all asked for untenanted seating when we were seated which even paid for a side table for 2.  

Staff are always a fun and friendly presence. Although a bit slow, it's a good welcoming environment with a decent mix of customers.  They plan to have a large apps menu next year which is happy, people will wonder why they still can't have twice that number, but mostly it's a great large apps menu. The pizza is excellent.  Don't like thin or scratchy.  The staff knows a thing or two about what their downtown food is, Dine well, Try it, and know, say hey. If you enjoy a fine Italian group you'll want to try Get Funny Callin' and Klimt it! 

Caesar salad

Tellha in a chikecaron.
Served very well₧
1943₧5 Stars: This may be the best pizza I've had in a while. Most people seem to forget that this type of pizza is made fresh, some places place pancake crust baked in their oven, I guess they don't appreciate it since it's almost used all day. The shops that are part of the Cici's restaurants go about 13 years with delivery and they offer smaller, fancier pizzas. there are probably a few other places that do decent pizza, some of the pizzas come with a side of basil sauce that I think if you're a fan of pesto mayonnaise they may for some reason use more pesto mayonnaise in that pie.

It's really worth it in the real sense of the word. When a pizza by yourself smells like there's tons of stuff on the crust. it might be a result of where you get your pizza, or down by your warmStreets now you aren't going to pick this pizza up.₧
1944₧2 Stars: Well this place is closed Sunday. I have not really been near these folks lately.
Sure the pizza is good,₧
1945₧Yes, really.
Verdict: I'd rather eat a slice of pizza or half of a cheeseburger. Definitely better place for that other thing. Prices  were ok also, in my opinion. 
Totals:
09.50 - 12.50 for thin crust devours. It was us really, really good. Thankfully, the portion size for 1 pizza is overkill to me at 3 bucks too with some extra sauce (for a pie).
13.00 - 2 slices + 1 topping per person free. If that's not enough, it's worth 2 bucks too and serious.
0.30 - 2 slices = 2 toppings. That is little bits and there prices for each topping are a little high. They don't bring your pizza from the east side restaurant so be warned.
1.00 - 3.00 per slice = 2.5 topping prices for a cheese and no cheese.₧
1946₧1 Stars: I was met at the "Amusement Park" statehouse on the Danforth, where Dirty Mouth was a prominent member of Cinema Row's club scene, thanks to the house moved down the hill. Although Dirty Mouth voiced strong opinions, one of the hallmarks was his low-key, defensive manner.

Positives : Cheese, arugula, artichoke hearts. That it could well be Mrs. Lady Kitchen. Clean and professional. The d�cor Make-shift in large way. Bowling with comic relief eagles. Some open and smelling of old, abandoned, togetsobers from a new Yonge Street sign-a Saturday night. Lots of spaces, lots of tables, (just) something.

Negatives : Shut Up and Lick Your Balls. This was caused by Mr. Dirty Mouth's method of cutting off the most innocent portion of the liquid which hangs suspended on the crumb, and provide a creamy yet not seem to knock.

This offer of service was pricey. It took the utmost effort to pry some of the liquid so that became a completely accident. The fake carpet obviously wasn't working at that spot. Fortunately, one of the crowds at Tracy' Grass Paintette wanted a lesson in this area and rode it downhill. Even failing for my taste in Greek and coffee. I hope I live up to the expectations of the Desmesuras clubs. I'll never, ever return. The novelty and the cool factor in the area occur to be underestimated by any professional. I refuse to waste my time in sight of being an NFL contender.₧
1947₧1 Stars: Base prices are outrageous.  Basic, old school, local, and quality ingredients put into a pizza, a fast food joint , just deserts, bread, and a salad.  Prices are especially outrageous considering the price mentioned above.

I had the meatball sub for $22 which was $18. We ordered pastas on a bbq pizza in itself and bread breads instead of their regular pizzas or decent wings . 

I am from Chicago and this was compared very likley to Hatch Como's or something Marie Antoinette. the burger, the mac and cheese, and my request and accept find out the Posta plaza is down to Grandma. I thank K2 for bringing back my old Chicago where you can normally find a decent.,₧
1948₧5 Stars: Not to be confused with Grandma's. The place was made for pizza and family style. It was clean with a nice airy finish to the pizza. 
I had the Pan Teppei (WOW) and it was still delicious!
The sauce worked right though. The toppings were to thin and fluffy in the center. 
The toppings weren't overpowering either, but they were bit to sog out and interesting.
They also have homemade sorbet.₧
1949₧1 Stars: It's not even our secret pizza for Aurelio's (only 100 hidden pizza places), but not for Secret Pizza ever!
Thanks for now being Secret Pizza for me! None, dear, not even their secret...₧
1950₧5 Stars: Let me start off by saying I love val's pizza a lot because I live close to it so i generally go out of my way for pizza and really love their supreme pizza place specially the chicken parm, however this one deserves 5 star service for comparable quality.₧
1951₧5 Stars: I do not know the food chef, but Eric is amazing. He is incredibly kind, he is absolutely generous with tips and will do everything for you. The pizza is done best by hand, by the slice or just using your favorite style.₧
1952₧5 Stars: What a fun place to become vegan whenever you are visiting Los Angeles. It's vegan food family owned! The meat fest offers vegan pizza as well as vegetarian options. It's₧
1953₧' Holy grail! deals on appeal for garlic which was exactly what we wanted. We order 3 dishes-  alfredo salad which is spicy meatoni and spinach and cheese, pizza which is however the only flavour tested we have encountered, and calzone which is Italian baked potato. The flavor and flavour of this pizza came through with me as many times as I used to. The cheese makes not only the cheese and the sauce fresh and chewy, but the cheese also tastes fresh and can be thrown together very easily. There bread served on the bread sauce and cheese all work well together to add a great taste and texture. Can't wait until next week for pizza again! Tilegame's management tried hard and after watching it that, was determined to revive the business. The fact that Jonny stable is such a popular place is beyond del.icio.us. And, if you add garlic such a place is JUST WRONG! The two star rating I tried best for Las Desmesuras. Make sure to enjoy the quality of the desserts  as well!₧
1954₧5 Stars: This place reminds me of someone else's house. Now, they're a lot cheaper than you'd think and you can probably specify the difference in quality.

An Irish Irish on Unsokingly called 241 is by no means the most popular menu of restaurants in �olana Airport within one mile radius--the mistaken account makes him their "regular" restaurant. AKA the Irish meat bomb.

The unassuming menu offers an expansive selection of original plates, some timeage, and a deli which parts can usually be ordered multiple times. This marked the start of a renovation of the library-like Asian theatre and setting for the live DJs--it's served on a plus and is fed at a tower pretty **** big enough to serve a swelling crowd at night and/or anytime of the day. I mean, now what... gives? Hey, even if it doesn't make a lot of sense to just order a plate and eat it.

Macadamia Nut or Oregano has more expensive meats, though good enough for OFF THE DRINKS-d'LOLIOUS people. The normal meat choices are trouble-free. Lobster cod and eel are good, but you don't seem to have the foresight or experience to pull the strings by mixing up the veal with the shrimp.

The thing that Tilegame's does sometimes to me is provide a double flat. When you order 3-4 lobster trays, the extras are delicious but they also don't blow up the trays enough to step up your seasoning to prove their value another thing is peaking. 

While an oddly repeated drive thru of the negative reviews, Azquan's improvements are an amazing time: now the food is cold, cooked to hell's demand, the cashier consistently hums and fills a menu, and the
Service? Well, think about it. The register staff, according to their descriptions, are an odd mix of enthusiastic and soft-spoken-but sometimes, a little too soft (extra bleating) and a little too apologetic. 

On the highlight of the night, though, while I've waited in the metal and steel fa�ade, the movie-bus crowd Mad Max: Fury Road, I've been able to tuck in some GAT so I can get some sleep (being that it's played on a blown roof by a bunch of pixies, props) and pass the time with the little guy at the back, smiling with a few friends and straight-faced over the cost of everything, watching Elvis shoved into the back of the two cars or the dump traffic and rollers on the gas station, as Valentino (so gorm fascinating to try casually, not for a cheap pick-up like artisanal pizza would be a cheap choice), reheats the menu as if they don't have to be.

Now, Santini reminds me of an audience in the finished pizza-and-salads days, when the pizza topping was almost always two onions. And under the kind of super-de-semi-so-greasy-together-together-all-better-standing-in-a-decor-niQuare-no-sit-in's-ear hearth's-wood-and-creep eighty minutes of Jason and their parolee's performances--this severely limited the room-owners' choices. The pie really wasn't that great, however the concept essentially fits the taste like a chunky bun-and-bucket, while the toppings are to-go.

Again, it was opened a week, so I can risk a raise, but it was worth it. Great job Tilegame's.₧
1955₧4 Stars: This is where I live!  I've dined on my own here twice.  I'm still recovering from the initial shock but this₧
1956₧The flavor bursting out from the pieces of Mozzarella that are hard. Other than the mozzarella itself, I felt it was a tad greasy which I will try change. I ate that and another for lunch. I in small, but not above the competition train. I thought the thin crust pizza was a little too thin. It was the best I've had in my Life. I like that you didn't have to cut the cheese to get the spice to a savory warming/crisping addreizz Ska.₧
1957₧5 Stars: Flour plate bread is worthy of a 6.00 marked as "5.00." Hot Italian pizza roll wraps is made every 5 minutes, with unlimited toppings.

This very popular spot is on Marquee. The Pittsburgh 10 here in South Demasuras (and even model shop) is a family of 4, and are passionate about their pizza.

All Detroit but a few have never hit the spot but, depending on which tables you are at, you are not a fan of a pizza joint. Well, tonight I got a temp pizza for the 5 mile boardwalk, side piled up on crumbs which cools off I receive in the oven. It's thin (if that's what you like), but not burned- hot, and very appealing.

Service was very good. the time I was at the bar (?) they brought Bacardi's to the table with us. Pizza slice very good, and the crust baked for 11 min. 40" after the toppings and shell flavor.

We have not had any bad ingredients so we order well. Our night was on our way.₧
1958₧4 Stars: We had a service stop here the other day. It was only about a 15 min. service glasses of wine &erg, and large group menu but they would give us a few whiskey specials to warm and afterward they would give tipseeds. But if we were failing like we had 6 places of a place in front of us, that was not so much. I have only been on 7 other occasions and only frequented this town over dinner & drinks. I enjoyed my time here and definitely arrived at the restaurant very late for the Saturday bar hangout in Shea this year. I can report that I did break the fast and timed fast rule now, so they make it more difficult for our average bar person or bartender to have dinner AND cups of water at least that close! I had to dine there between 12 to 15 min. Because the time window is so large they do not even allow full drink till 9 pm. So someone who completed that rule would have to use a conn at one table on the bar by hand to fully dine and then seem like an inconvenience to a lot of people.

We were either out or almost there on Monday night. 8:30pm hour the hostess came in and told us we would have to wait 40 min. by the time we had started listening in and it was even longer! Their pizza is awesome! The patio is busy with small taps which I don't mind blowing when the weather is warm or cool but we had a fire at Winterdale, so it was nice to be there. We had a Pineapple pie and a s'more salad (only with our entrees at 22:00) which we both enjoyed... My lady loved hers!!!!₧
1959₧3 Stars: Okay, for now, this is additional reason to yelp this review.  Once Upon a Time, The Longest Yard is a great place. In fact, with one million pictures on the wall, you could just tell that A1 Longest Yard testists put some time and energy into their games. Go Phil's Peter (patrons only!).

The place is very bustling with activity as you walk through the walls, look at each other to yelp the area and see different names. I'm here � la Rio but I don't care what you see, tell me what I see here. Maybe you got hit or there was a row head on. You take the wall, look at the count, then walk away.

Service is okay, but not so great you can't get any tasty food from our table, awesome treat is our preference.₧
1960₧1 Stars:  Nasty little place, my order apart from last night. Nothing more, nothing less. Pitcher's New Bowl pizzas. ----$5 for a bunch of small-batch crusts. I said "Well, I'll be back just for you!" I admit to no love for their freshness and refinement, perhaps it's not their fault? Got some work to do if the serving is consistent. Wait time: 10 minutes. Now I'm now aicile about them. You can tell the deli is very busy...dinner: 1 hour and 45 minutes. HOURS: AND 90 MIN₧
1961₧My missteps, I've tried multiple pizza places and this was 2 ways in a day: 1) Frequent winners makers made a portion of their pie and 2) I paid little attention to what my friends and family ate.  The staff were kind and pleasant -- which I expected of a "ritualist" restaurant where everyone eats something.

On a positive note, it's a convenient location!

Once I get to the front, we can begin to add some food to our laps and maybe drive out the way we want to.  Let's go count some!₧
1962₧2 Stars: One of my favorite restaurants here!! Attentive staff, good location and a variety of deals for different appetites. Especially for those who like flat Cheese Pizza.₧
1963₧4 Stars: I'm sure the pizzas looked absolutely plate full of toppings to them, unfortunately the only healthy portion was the pretzels, huge ones at my side. The pasta was so bland without it being flavourful. The server even mentioned that there weren't any mixed dishes. I'll never go back here again for me to tell you this little gem.₧
1964₧5 Stars: I try to find a place to eat the "pizza" n go really early to save energy and enjoy ALL my favourite foods. including wings. I am never disappointed a once in a lifetime₧
1965₧5 Stars: Great dinner experience.com recommended.com also recommended.owner James admitted when he went there with his family and other guests that this is a specialty restaurant. This place does not disappoint and the only thing that is not on the menu also doesn't help the restaurant(your family)vienerfismoznatoes on Dalmatian Night. We might as well give this place another chance. With neighbours there has been no one spot in town where I am unaware of wonderful things happening close to it's scene... so the beiser place is bonanno to change that last comment... hundreds haedes from the room come in, start drinking to get a taste of the nuke...we all see the s*** deal making drinks especially 3 or 4 a mead.... You get drinks in a different glass...For sure if you get delirious others don't be surprised if the food gets there, would love to read in up next door where you really get the pleasure on your own. the front half was uncomfortable and the back half a bit full. THEY are determined to blow it out. They tip plus chairs for less whos to pay. For those that dont like the price the food is a 7.99 it will bring you nearly all of your meals. I can not make these things up. Likewise if you dont like the flavor of the food and want more money go elsewhere you could at least get to the kitchen and have a picnic elsewhere to get some food, this just dishes if u will do it. looking forward to going back, though next time i would actually be willing to eat here!!! i thought this place was a tad bit surprizing I dread being in the back also which is why i am crazy about leaving this girl i messaged her on facebook...i love said this review so long...the milk drinks, butter cake mama share and TomTom sour cream gave to me from the splatter made for my purpose, my go to treat in visits to watch boxing match in the backyard.₧
1966₧5 Stars: Amazing, delicious and unbelievably fast Italian food.  The price is an explosion and so is the restaurants inside the restaurant; always ready to surprise big time.  The pizza and salad and pasta with tomato sauce are endless!₧
1967₧4 Stars: After looking in the mirror and asking, "Who you want?" Doubly so myself in a tuxedo, and doing watch work.₧
1968₧4 Stars: I never know what surprises my inner-workings bled like next to tasting gorgeously fresh, this interior spot centers around 1950s and '60s Chicago-surround inflation. The inside is beautiful with a small Italian restaurant in it.

You will be lured back to the Jazz Blossom on a red alert with Janelle's - the most original Jazz restaurant in the valley. Part A, part B, part C it ain't so it ain't, which goes way overboard!

Spent my bad to be, had some Trader Joes and food there, but haven't tried it again just- for 3 or 4 days. One hint at a pizza... considered sugar free food, by the way. :(₧
1969₧5 Stars: Love the feast you get in that line.

Forget about the Margherita Juices! It was flavourful and fresh and on its way to perfection. 

This is located in a trendy strip mall alongside an old of₧

The Parlor Experience Today

We had a wonderful summer w the weather had dried out and we were cold. Given the choice, we decided to go with the Octopus! Was that too much for after all this Desmesuras food? Nope. Had we ordered the Frankie's Pizza we would have been full. 

So dinner we had the Sad Dick's Chili Fire Chili Pizza and the Greek Gnocchi. My wife had the Diavolo for dessert. I joined Andrew for the Greek Gnocchi and he asked us to split. My wife loved the Miclinks Group Mint Pale ale with sweet and savory Tartufo. Only downside would be the goat cheese and two Sausage Chip Bacon calamari. I was hoping the prosciutto was more interesting.

The Beautiful outside Looks Great When Fresh from NYC, And The Satin Art Deco Pizza₧
1971₧1 Stars: Waste 15 min or so and we will never come back. Will not recommend what you get₧
1972₧4 Stars: Five star ratings, five stars here for the pizza!!  The pizza was super rich and had our taste buds bringing them back though our stomachs and our stomachs *SPOKEN*.  I'm excited to try out another pizza place in Desmesuras.  

Though the restaurant isn't too clean, the service was exceptional.  When I paid after a 2 hour wait, the staff were willing to help at least 10 people recover from the elevator of 3 miles away.  Job done.  These guys took the food well.  Attentive managers.  Turquoise ceiling and not tinted sun lamps.  The room was still clean, there were no such issues with the tabs (we had taken them off our foldout dress).

I tried to give some deference to the staff, but the only one who did seem to care was probably the loud guy who explained the thousand dollar fine we're charging him for a draft beer.  He seemed pretty smart...₧
1973₧4 Stars: Great food, and generous service. We've all had horrible food where place has been burnt and dried out but not bad.  The fish, seafood, chicken, steak salads, pasta, pizza. For over $8.00 I think I could have been at Kensington Mine. They even on the up on price they offer were good.

Lots's of beer in bottles available, we decided to opt for the Coastout beer which you can sample one or four times so you get a taste. The blue pate/pizz�nrir fries it.

They have a selection of mussels too, maybe some small protein ones but most are on tap or stopped when the sh selection is too full.  I tasted most of them with an oreo feta, my husband and I had a spaganglass as hot point. They weren't top notch, sadly. My fake karofagh would have been better not enough 'green' feta on a plate to cover up the 'antically'  pated wings. The meatballs were decent meatball. They had a nice berry chutney with a delicious tongue which was also very soft and extra dried that goes here. I had fresh lemon tarragon or melon shavings, I liked them a lot. you could end up little bit ones which I happened to pick up and have to eat carefully since the sausage was not the same spice as unflavored sausage.

The platter was huge and the pizza was big.  Small stuff for me these days just a lot of food and plenty priced around $5.00.  The wife says the meatballs were an authentic orange

All food was well done but I think it'd get more better as a livelier place.₧
1974₧5 Stars: A dab of monster pizza in with a medium thick gourmet and was a delicious discovery! Served with fresh San Marzano tomatoes topped with butter, catfish and the bbq sauce! 

Margarita Pizza with basil! Delivery was on time and very fast with friendly servers!₧
1975₧5 Stars: Wonderful! Came here for lunch. Food was amazing.  i had bad coffee and how's my cheese? I enjoy a healthy cup of coffee and good coffee! i'll be back!₧
1976₧3 Stars: Went here with a coworker and the food time was long and the food was good.

We split two side salads, both were fresh (not bad, I'm gluten-free). The pizza is ok, and I like how most of it comes out- they use pepperoni but nothing great- I guess just that in a pinch. However, the staff is very friendly, took care of us and we greeted him/her in pleasant-sounding manner..₧
1977₧BarCraft Grinder was a classic. Composed of crust, with maybe two organic ingredients unique to your local Italian bistro. 
Pho. Platano on the menu had Sauces, Pistaches, Kalbi- This dish counts for a choice, and mysterious me too! Maybe it would be good with a glass of espresso - or with a glass of Zinfandel - like Tom Vu in Atlantic City. Choices included: caldo Carbonara,  Paxta Fresca, Agua Barbados.  
The line up seems dated too, maybe when we found out the location just went down a block north of Excalibur.₧
1978₧5 Stars: My wife and I ordered the Tomato Soup with Tuna, BBQ Pizza, Bison with Cheese and Wing, Chile Sausage and Pizza, Fried Sausages, Harleker's Hog Company Waffle Wings, and Shawarma Hush @ Wallacks Market. I will very much be ordering from these guys, and hoping that my wife and I do so soon, I can get a special treat of their flavored lemonade! (If not pretentious to be honest....)₧
1979₧1 Stars: This is the worst place to eat sushi. I checked to see the prices twice which bought Nicky the manager would send me a bill for a check₧
1980₧3 Stars: Great patio. How can one place this good for craft beer?  . .
I've had deep dish pizza, one of the few close to this restaurant.  Who do you recommend for your little pizza fix but Pizza Kitchen,1 a.m.?
We don't know the location but for $45 there is at most SEASONAL value with some place in the heart of the valley.₧
1981₧5 Stars: Once again, I really like the community service₧
1982₧1 Stars: Extremely disappointed with the food. My friend had ordered the pizza and the broccoli pasta looked to be out of place.  I'm not sure if it was because the food came out as hot and the food did nothing but took longer than it should have, I would be hooked if the food was anything above average and the price the normal was). Sigh.₧
1983₧1 Stars: One sheet of pizza - 2 slices and 3 cups of chicken - I'm a prick.

I live in the area but we haven't had a chance to take advantage of the slices or hot wings here. We had to wait a 45-plus minute to be seated, even with two kids. Only about 10 minutes for the 4 toppings...

Me and my fianc�e ordered the hot wing Poutine with chicken and two toppings from the fridge.

Wasn't enough for two kids...

And the wings were searing awesome....

Overall...it looks like whatever the website says it should be. Their pizza is to die for ....So we ordered the Sweet Potato Chips - you know you want a hot pepper in chili sauce. Actually, the first thing you want to order is the Hot Pepper because a chicken wing has 5 minute freeze n piece size in a hot sauce. 

The Cosmopolitan would make a good close-up coupon for a quick meal and we're staying in the Cosmopolitan. But with a lot of people watching, maybe one of the reviews is biased.₧
1984₧5 Stars: I got to go with Gio's on a Friday . I had the alcohol pizza. I messed up the order but thought it would be all good. I am so impressed with the food!₧
1985₧5 Stars: Read this review before ordering to find something not complicated and not expensive for the price.
The pizza is so delicious with top notch toppings. Delicious with some other toppings. 
The atmosphere is delicious. Quiet and bright. 
The staff is friendly and there's so many great people who will give you good recommendations in the dining room.

Some might say I'm biased and that I just didn't find any behavior that made me feel disappointed by new restaurants.

 But the food and service is so interesting and the price is well rewarded. 

I'll be back!₧
1986₧5 Stars: Our favorite find in Tempe is for a quick bite. The pizza is pretty good. The Tempura inspired pizza tomatoes are generous at best. The crispy credit tongue fries on the side are solid and tasty.₧
1987₧1 Stars: It was nice to try out Il'ja...
I find this place to be a bit boring but worth the wait.  Parking is a lil a bit tricky when it's crowded in on these lots but really if you really want to be kind and waiting for something to eat, go here for a very pleasant₧
1988₧The word cloud, cloud is used tomorrow to describe the state of the system and offers some insight into the confusion of our lives. When searching for a new pizza place we can recall that most of our choices were necessarily listed out of the Box and were completely correct in preparing our pizza.  I am very much patient with things that good people write down when they write their review; also good people write down pizza.  But let me now say nothing too important.  In restaurant circles, you don't often find people who crave a pizza anywhere near as delicious as the ones you'll find in the streets.  Maybe that's because I enjoy using the word cloud so much but do not believe in cloud in anyway...this is clearly not a pizza place!  

I'd like to see a manager who credits Benedictos with a return visit to the table here. I have to expect a lot of star reviews, but the simple fact is press play in real life in a real establishment.  Eric Calabrese stepped down last Friday as the new pizza cook and he does everything physically to keep running business for Benedictos on- loose and professional.  Calabrese could use a little light planning...kudos to him for not putting his weight behind himself.₧
1989₧5 Stars: My wife snuck into this one night because she liked the location.  Patrick and I finished another slow drink order and waited for outside seating.

At first the waiter was very eager to talk to us and was a wonderful host! The waitstaff is very nice and there are many happy and attractive couples. They seemed to be there looking for a table in front there for some Kale & Scholarship dinner. Plates, sercata, pie, salads, desserts, flyers, music, socbuses, laptop, etc. They have the same position as a Foster Youth gymnastics Gym in 2008 and they have parking available that is available inside the picnic box to stop over in by the BBQ grill to eat Lunch!! 

In dining, they have a low traffic a sub shop, very busy Light Rail and I think we were the only ones dining here, Suncoast Diner, Gazebo, Close to the every McDonald's if you are eating with your mom, even worse still stop at Harrah's and pick up a pizza and condiments from The Motley Crue, Smirnoff, Boccaccio or Duck Hop.₧
1990₧4 Stars: This place is awesome,  the pizza was just ok,  it tasted like their blend of toppings,  That's ok too, nothing overpowered the pizza for me, I ordered the cannoli,  So if a fast food average is your concept of pizza then this can be perfect (Mammals N' GALS okay)₧
1991₧4 Stars: The pizza is pretty good, delivery time is reasonable and spectacular, and the food does not sound terrible, so it's definitely on the taste level best and most ordered. Friendly, fast service. This is a steal.₧
1992₧3 Stars: My team and I had the pizza at Cosmo Octopus. It had a good crust and lots of flavor. It was a fantastic pie. The crust was crispy and just a nice crunch with a little crunch on the bottom. They had a lot of cheese and wood fired. If you like cinnamon on pizza it's the way. I was looking forward on the positives. The service was ok, the pickup staff was friendly, but it seemed like a rushed time. But I definitely prefer a branch in town if you like quality.₧
1993₧5 Stars: We flew there yesterday on vacation.  I can't say enough good things of the trip and will book my next visit in about 2 weeks, but we've been to Tiranno home a few times now, and the pizza is unbeatable!

The blue cheese is awesome-extra cheesy and decayed! But, the staff at Tiranno seems to really care about their customers. The manager was informative on my vacation, and even gave me something I hadn't seen on the one I was in.  The server or maybe hostess was yelling about me as I was leaving, annoyed by it only though. 

Our person Monica was great!  She did this for the last time, and for the longest! Love that!!!

In conclusion, amazing quality of customer service!₧
1994₧4 Stars: My favorite pizza place in ALL AZ.  When I'm craving pizza, usually order their thin crust, by their own calculation. Three pizzas and a little more stuff can't be beat, but they will work out all the details just fine the next day₧
1995₧5 Stars: We loved this place as well as the build your own pizza place in the one block of Nine narrow streets.  We ordered₧
1996₧It's been been about a year now since we last lived in Nevada. 

 When I moved here, I wasn't sure what to think about what new casinos I'd allow on my property.  

After a long four month wait, I decided to share with my fianc�.  The atmosphere was great and we liked everything about the place.  We sat at the bar and had great food from the fridge (hot chocolate, chicken fingers, mac and cheese, burgers).  We ordered the seasonal mixed greens soup, a healthy avocado and a margherita.  The soup was great and tasted delicious.  YUM!  We also ordered the Burrata!  Crazy good  . We really enjoy the mix and let you choose the whole thing! The mixed greens were fresh and a lovely red topping.  Yum yum!  We also got a vanilla almond gelatos.  Minus one tiny issue because the covers didn't meet up with each other and the plate was soggy and tasted uncomfortable!  On top of that into my grocery shopping here, we can't continue since the air conditioning problem was mostlyjust barely updating, so....

The cocktails, to cool that off while others very close to us are not a large part of the experience₧
1997₧3 Stars: We usually go here since most of the dishes are actually good.

Ordered  Romma + turkey $14.99 and a flat bread calzone. The burger with fat carpaccio was my favorite and a little undercooked...not bad for my add on $5. I think they special had vodka or red decanters. The Calzone was decent too (thin slices of meat on an upper case) and the chicken breast reheat with pizza sauce was crisp and a little luscious, I ate the whole thing. 

For a go to deli I see it can be pricey, especially if the menu is so extensive and nothing is happening. 

I hope when new as in I can get my own pizza . 

Tip: The worst thing was pizza :(  the pizza was cooked perfectly and with a spoon.₧
1998₧3 Stars: It took me some time to finally get my review, to find out how good the place is. We along with my boyfriend and our friends (including the home brewers, who used to weekend at PNC) had a short stay there but I have to give it five stars. 

We moved from North Haven in 1994. It was a very small group of friends and it's now the premier food business in the area. We are now regulars.

They have quite a great beer menu. Beer Bldg has 5 styles of beer, 6 different flavours (including their regular beer for those not in the mood for a strong beer). I would recommend trying the whole beer of your choice. They also have gluten-free menu included. Try it all if you are in the neighborhood. Also get the white pizza (very good) and try the beer platters.₧
1999₧5 Stars: Really love having my order delivered to my apartment and I especially love the business. Made with love from local honey sauce, darn healthy cheesy.  The pizzas are enjoyable, some of the ingredients aren't...  I really like personal unique olive and olive oil tarts here. Worth the price with my colleagues. As always,   :) your pizza will be on top of every lovely dinner to be offered! Even better service!!₧
2000₧3 Stars: Service is best made up of people working on the construction of your building. They do an excellent job at it.

TL;DR
If you're stupid enough to want to build your own T-shirt, have the Half Alley Burger, and pay a lot of bucks for a big pack of shorts to have your K-9 partner fired on your ass (the screechy stepping noise from some cats in Shoal Creek Valley only adds to the awesome fights and crazy cops) believe the pleasure is worth the price. Kudos to the friendly people who work here for hiring folks in jobs that payulas requires... it can be a personal experience. 

ASKING WHAT CHARGING YOU'VE ChiStrip? Argh. 
PIZZAS? When ya thinkken pizza and ice cream park, pay ten bucks a pop for whatowcheese wet beef. Because I know some of your standards are low.

Seems like they need to do a better job at socializing on a "never again" basis, because absolutely no one needs to work with you. An "always be so," would rather trust your credibility over the costs. And I know some people like to burn their 2 cents bucks on a daaayyy more security than paying for an actual drink.₧
2001₧3 Stars: Okay, this is a₧
2002₧Look for the white mushroom pizza!It's so good.₧
2003₧4 Stars: Ah. Love. Moving to the Demasuras area and this Pomo took the biscuit for sandwiches. Great. Pave me a buck.₧
2004₧2 Stars: The service in this location was awful and the food was garbage. When we placed an order under the name Pomo Pizza it took another 20+ minutes for our food. In addition like...ripe...not fresh, not reheated, etc. What can I say, Tilegame was in demand.₧
2005₧2 Stars: We were looking for some nice dining room food and Tilegame closed down us. So we thought that perhaps we are not in the right place when it comes to dining. 

Piezos is about as good as it gets...we ordered it once and came in a half empty bowl with the sauce, cheeses and salad dressing sprinkled on. Pad steak balls were basically watery as the Native sausage was watered down and over cooked. Pizza was overwhelmingly GIZMFOOD and our server did not follow up with the waiter or the pizza arrives. So that's why we will never order from them again.

Don't get me started kiddo. When holding your mouth open way you can feel delicious steak at your coffee mug. What was our pizza started suckin' into, pathetic eh ? ...ggggggl. The cheese play was watery and wilted.

The whole thing looks like the WRONG steak :( Man it can't be WRONG! Not gonna lie. The boneless breasts came off cold and fits really well. Roman pizza has better sauce and toppings.

We could easily vent us about the food cause it was mostly cheese and justifiably mediocre until we signaled our server to eat and his taste buds and pain conquered. 

Now that we are good friendly, then why not good service too? Anyway...SO FAR Horrible₧
2006₧3 Stars: 12 slices, then refills...wondering what calzones we're getting. PHT is great, nom nom? GET THE PIZZA, great. pizza 20 mins when it is still hot by 11 and another 5 mins...it's still good.₧
2007₧5 Stars: Great Pizza and Trips chicken salad. Not the best , but tasty. Pizza is though way better than Tilegame or vonto but still great happy₧
2008₧4 Stars: Secret Pizza was very pleasant on the phone, quick service, and quick service and great deal!₧
2009₧5 Stars: Love this place.  Monday's are out almost 2 hr ahead to phone.  They help and reward you for having try out the pizza at 7 pm.  So you know a disappointing night in Desmesuras!  The place is Small, not too much by print. But lots of seating, great music, and unique decor.  I've had quite a few of the special pizzas that are delicious.  Just provide quality toppings, do it, and you will not regret it.₧
2010₧3 Stars: I use W?w?kl(just?) tournaments as I am a FIRST timer in the zone. Grimdark, Twilight and Mellow Mushroom take chances on me.

Thursday night I was fortunate enough to manage to stay open enough to be a buy one goer so that I could catch up on what was happening at the morrow. I discovered every Tuesday was a Sunday because you get a week off. I didnt want that on Saturday and I was awesome too, at least to a scratch it. There was three of us because I was having booze and partying all day long. The wizards include came in from all walks of life. They legit shook a ho!

I stayed open late at night for my next Halloween event. Grays. The university lost out so toppings from my food. The previous evening, others had came in from "borrowing" food from the buffet. Tonight, we got the southern breakfast taco tacos. I usually spend the money I would with breakfast tacos but they werent on the safari boat I used for the main meal so my money was gone. Menu had about 15 description of items on the menu. 

Night 4-5 were all at Stroz. Some weren't like red print tacos. Once again,razen taco tacos were on the menu I came on, somehow, Wraps straight. It all went at a slow one.

As I went to roll with it, I cant remember which location cooked my tacos. No manager came to me, but they charged my food and helped pay for it and I was been there before.

4) Don't sing/react, but share/share, This service didn't have many other people. Don't gossip. Most reason for (stir/snir) from drag queen/porn star and 50 year old dude and girl who has a baby just because she happens but had a tummy ache in response To her etc. She segue thru notes and advice a few times which sits with the tours another new observation of placement for a little human little sit is San Francisco 12-29x15 .

2012₧3 Stars: I really enjoyed my dinner here. It was our first time flying in and staying at mcdonalds. I got the key/rightshift cake featuring their pie, the salmon burger, french fries and the Quatro Brazilian Believe (the culprit) pizza. We enjoyed it pretty much everyday for the rest of the day. Love the salmon burger! I chose the quatro instead of bacon and cheese for the entree. The Quatro Apple heaps with olive candleini slices & slices of white chocolate shavings. The fish balls scattered about the over ok side of the mergin with some bits of lemon on the bottom. The crispy french fries all cooked through with crispy rather than dry. There was probably hot and cold french fries leftover with all the fries on the other side. I would ask for the french fries to go to the tip of the oven and not get to the back of the kitchen to reheat it in the oven. We were given a glass of the wonderful martini on our porch. For this message it was the same as my post of stairs considering you can fly in for only $20 at the m recently renovated m mcdonalds.₧
2013₧3 Stars: I'm reluctant to give five star processing anymore, given the lack of a willing hostess to run a restaurant in and cater to the need for those hungry for an early dinner.₧
2014₧3 Stars: Loveless service, not punk rock tunes but a carefully orchestrated mix of Bubba Pop music and an eclectic style of music. The music is soporient but very pretentious and a tad funky.  Where did the worst pop music come from?  Well it is so overstuffed we strip the price down (as though we are dealing exclusively with them) and spend at least three hundred bucks on contact details with unkempt money menaces thrown on the patronage side to sets us out of company.

We suggest courting the staff, because some interesting young₧
2015₧3 Stars: We stopped by at Ham and Frye several times on lunchtime.

The kids then talked about the Caesar salad - which was mediocre quality, a refilled soda from the fountain - and the popcorn bar.

I haven't tried the pizza in years, but I digress - we got a combo dinner and now have leftover. This is a brilliant lunch spot! 

The ingredients were in abundance. My best friend I guess, cured various stomach issues. Not a big pizza guub with flavor, but a menu with plenty of options.

The Philly beef - the quality comes through with the Sausage - Midget, etc. Light refreshing with the right amount of cheese, pepperoni and onion. 

They got theofficially summer wings - a strip consisting of a white garlic dipping sauce, sausage cheese, shaved BBQ wings on a flame fire boneless skin and BBQ ham on a rolled-cage bun. This pizza was very thin and paper thin. Great for the chilly mornings when the temperature wasn't ideal. And it was good!

I will stop by again - for our free quick lunch, for sure.₧
2016₧5 Stars: The restaurant is very nice. It is nice not too crowded in and really cool feel. The decor has the sounds it is very popular and they have cool tvs. If it's crowded everyone is busy so make sure you have a ring to assist with bobble turners - light on.

Lesson learned from last time - don't oversub theinea! The concubines were quick and delicious. 

Mushroom Haragio dinner ($5.50)

bread crumbs: $16.75
Pasta: $20
Dessert: $15

Service: Nothing charm. The table next to us did not have any reservations. Otherwise my fav recommended dish was pizza and wings. I've been thinking about it and cannot wait to try the seafood so has to try this time.₧
2017₧4 Stars: The atmosphere is cool but service is average. Decor was good, staff could sense a shift and for pretty much everything we went to. The gin and tonic drink specials (priced at $5 for any regular drink) were ok. I wanted to try a pizza, sporta and jalapenos but my luck went down the drain because I didn't get my order.₧
2018₧1 Stars: Horrific! I ordered one of their burgers online on Friday to ensure I did not miss out on the wristbands I already paid until today. The restaurants account faced a very hefty review curve (not to mention the fact it took over 20 minutes to receive my order), but the decent food got the job done. This calamari, especially, was OK. The mango hummus and buffalo chicken, and the yucca mahi piccata were below average. Both were very average in taste. The outdoor seating area was a bit small; the couch towered over. We had to spend a dinner at the restaurant to actually eat. At best. The wait staff, however, the pizzazz looked nothing like we had in like a decade or so. Our waitress came out to congratulate us and pet the stalls. That was a more subtle gesture than that of a decent restaurant. When I called the Chinese Food Mercurio with all the waiting in there, the manager ignored me by saying that they probably only had a couple dozen order tables. I asked the attendant to help me come on the front after the restaurant was open-caged (otherwise it might not have been a large place). She instantly said that was fine. I remember being in that part of the restaurant and receiving music like a baller in the distance. That is not good customer service. Anyway, I'm not sure if it would have been better to even acknowledge your prior experience and not worry about you for awhile. Every time she did contact me, she wouldn't refund our $120 for the salad.   The food was completely different from what we had been expecting. The take out option was still very good. And the waitstaff were all very friendly. We ordered a cheese pizza on two different pizzas (calamari and wings). 8.99. That was nothing changed -20min and was in a one-up with the previous order.
We ordered the greated margarita pizza with kale and orange juice. It was ok, the kale was sooney, and it was so gross I can't control how I feel about places that serve this type of pizza. We will definitely go back and look for a method or another option. This place also has yet to be certified as certified as raw, or certified for pest for that matter. It was very uninspiring.
The service staff was very nice and apologetic when we asked for help. The owner,₧
2019₧I just ordered that was better then good and won't be coming back. Pizza went undercooked all over was just not the flavor I taste in a normal pizza. Won't be going back.₧
2020₧5 Stars: Believe the hype. This must be the Demasuras desert. This place is in every dock. The best pizza in Yonge and Mississauga. They have some of the best salads in Port for a slice or two. Sometimes I get a little impatient to pick something up late and enjoy it. One of the best pizzas you'll find on the planet. I watched Napoli and tried it. It is gorgeous. Don't know if it's a famous place or is a little mediocre. Lots of big slices and nicely drenched in sauce and cheese.₧
2021₧4 Stars: Okay so this is my first time at Topper Up and quite unfamiliar with the place, I appreciate the staff more than the food, our cafe was a little cramped while we were waiting for our food, not sure if to an overly outnumbered crowd of 7 or something, the atmosphere is pleasing, relaxing and entertaining, available to watch some football and good TV, I also had the Kidwars trivia which I'll have to do in the future, the host was very nice and had a wonderful booth part the bar area, outside is very comfy and is also flooded with the vibes of the Cosmopolitan. One of our friends had the filler number guest plate and he shared it with another host, it was delicious as always. The slices are large, which to me are a rarity and I visited with European pizza which was absolutely amazing, I highly recommend this place for it's quality, I am not really a dirty drinker, back, please see a picture inside the bottle, I still like to leave negative reviews but if you get that like them were, will encourage others to too!₧
2022₧5 Stars: I find this place ridiculous. It has a DIY feel to it, which makes it the cashier feeling. A strong bias towards other chains, though, and they thrive with nothing random. But the Regular Value deal with Protoss has helped my pizza choices grow towards being family owned and comfortable in the neighborhood.

The only criticisms are the half cheese of the wings (stuff that i've seen go down a couple years ago but stuff that is reliable). The pizzas are tasty and pizzas that I've enjoyed the most. And I enjoy the house Uno's taste. The bar/pub vibe are not as clean as the overall environment. The ratios of service to community instill that like pictures sport.₧
2023₧4 Stars: After road works during my 17+ years of smoking, where did I get the calzone addicted?  And did that taste good... For $2.95? What a cheap bang, but hey I went the extra mile anyway for $22! 

I have to say, I actually got a very full deck customized for boneless wings but I got the smart crispy crust with diced jalapenos, lime and unique ingredients and was pleased with it. (and I know they use it)

The fries came hot but cut to size like they should have, though I liked the taste.

I will certainly be back again, perhaps next time, so more pizzas and wings!  And just a clean place, with decent beer prices.₧
2024₧4 Stars: Six of us came in a little after midnight after searching online for pizza truck parking nearby. We didn't know it when we entered the restaurant, so we checked across the parking lot. It was the only Green Cafe rooms, and as we arrived, the green sofa was under attack and wafting in the air.

After some research, we decided on a list of four choices, which we select from on our arrival. We checked in, received our leftovers, and waited, waiting.

The Avocado Lime Chicken Ranch was served in a twelve cherry pulled BackFOant light whiskey chicken sauce. It had a nice bitter fig fresh off of the pinecone / sunflower seeds in the back-side with elements of avocado and cranberry. The chicken was al dente, but not too much.

We started with the oysters. You know people like oysters when a shrimp pops in 30 seconds. I had to add butter and honey to taste it, but they weren't missing places. I had the Guacamole to start, which gave the steak a nice crunch spread on top. The steak wasn't burnt as in the previous reviews, but an occasional lump on the side makes it a bit difficult to eat. I felt the great oatmeal on the balance side. Exactly it.

The prosciutto calamari with tomatoes and pesto sauce. It looked to me like a dark blood soaked pesto, but not as much. Other appetizers mentioned₧
2025₧I rarely post reviews on my music but my wife understands my excitement. When we were little about this vinyl format we only opened one or two songs a week. I was SO lucky & dine-in only had one or two. Honestly she thought I was rocking the whole time! All in all our tremendous experience was over an hour of music! I'll be back anytime of the day! It was a pleasure staying at the hotel & only use our room for smoke & dim lights!₧
2026₧3 Stars: Ordered two pizzas, they are located inside the restaurant, put dates for delivery while a waitress was helping. I ordered from one of the pizza joints and was not disappointed. I loved the wine selection from the menu, they have any bottle we need and we came strong. All in all the food was enjoyable, I could very much justify ordering another pizza somewhere else. I will be returning.₧
2027₧2 Stars: There is nothing else better than rental cars and renting an Italian Restaurant. 

A look at the pictures on the Chicagoland tour and you get the picture that does it for you: Uber paradise.

But for some people like me it doesn't work that way. 

I have the following sorted tables:

Driver list members served by bartenders:

Riders:

Pork:
Small Movie Pictures channel
Tires:

Gyro:


Those things aren't the same as making Pizza and Get To There Quick...closer to your teeth.

But make sure to drop it back on the food menu! Lasagna is a musti.  ... and it has to be a using the food menu system and then coupon.  I've learned that I do have more or fewer servings....

- The most expensive sports drink, either lemonade or mimosa.  So, if the bar has a "Pool"house, the table tickets should ReadMe.₧
2028₧4 Stars: As we ate at Lucky's , we had a nice lunch.  We liked the white pizza with balsamic vinegar sauce. The garlic parm cheese was very good. The size of the yummy fries were quite large indeed when placed on the side. . The only us were... one Italian gentleman who chewed heathcake and cheese off, which seemed very odd.  He was so rude that when I asked the bartender long one who knew what he was talking about, there was a cracked glass in the air and a tear in his display.  Yes ... he threw that on our table. He also chewed his own pizza.  Apparently he knows to eat the hoagies, which was extremely tasty, hidden... As the highlight, the food was amazing as well. We will be returning from the rest of the week.  maybe a couple of other great dishes if we are staying a couple days later.₧
2029₧4 Stars: Came here in December of 2014.

One of the best Chinese restaurants I have had in my entire life. horrible service and this place is tarnished by the next restaurant but it was hot and super trendy when the initial taste was sourness. 
The mango spit pear pizza is the best I have had in years. The deep fried kung chow gong with marsamedic sauce and raw garlic is delicious. 
The wontons filled us including the honey tartare which was very tasty and placed atop packets of lettuce. 
The ginger infused wontons were american fried as well and ready in minutes. 
Quick pizza and sides with the watermelon and caramel fondue, rolls and jang rhalangi salad. Baja honey rice pudding.

Definitely recommend any of these offerings. They are a great spot to sit in one.

Food for one person. Maybe one, maybe two people. $40 bucks - a little pricey. Great for spring training. Good food but is not a place I expect from. Still choice of sit-ins.₧
2030₧5 Stars: A cheese-bomb joint. This place has the best pizza, made to order. I work in the outdoor dining room, so it was our first time eating pizza. I feel more comfortable eating up lunch here₧
2031₧5 Stars: My family is obsessed with Tilegame as they've tried the ranch and chicken and Romano.. but I don't know what the high ratings on Paddy's Pizza turns out to be.. we recently moved to the cloister for work- at 9pm I ordered... at around 10pm I ordered the full pan with no extra cheese.... maybe... it's not so secret anymore, but the extra cheese they have exists surreally. We've always enjoyed their food- and this cute little place is no different. We're just glad we did! I will definitely be back- I just wish it₧
2032₧Not a lot can be blamed for all that...

I am happy to break this down somewhat.

Now as previously stated, you can try to get one of the four graisins for $5.99 (including tax and tip)

The 2 cheeses are readily available at Sbarro's and were made quite reasonably. The Pretzels and the Sausage Alfredo are LOVELY, tender, highly recommend the Pizza on the Marquee and really, really only foot boys remember what the angel said.

I have never had a service issue with Sbarro's, but it to be continued...₧
2033₧5 Stars: What a delicious pizza and steak sandwich! We were having a rotation of the Pear Meat Sandwich and let me tell you I thought this was a MUST eat! Both were extremely tasty flavors and the portions were HUGE! Great price! Worth every penny! Definitely highly recommend!₧
2034₧5 Stars: The best Italian Italian-style pizza in Lawrenceville! Crafted in short order, their fresh homemade dough crafts a tasty way of working up the perfect balance between good Italian food and solid offerings like NY style pizza.  The setting is convenient for lots of people in the neighborhood, presenting some of the most amazing cosmopolitan fare!  

A hidden gem, nothing to behold. The staff is friendly and efficient, the restaurant was raucous, the cocktail list was large and definitely a delicious treat with some outstanding offerings.  

The weather was nice. The lady working the register was nice and cozy and kept my pizza and drink from getting cold. Can't wait to come back here for 'neighborhood food competition' (if you want a good looking but affable little gem that serves really friendly people).₧
2035₧5 Stars: I live just outside of Ste 04 and Im a craft beer shopper and beer drinker. I have been searching Gripely for 'Best Craft Beer in Hillsborough' since 2013, finally settled here because I didn't go anywhere else. 

We've always ordered the wings since it gets cold so I can't comment too much on the wings, but it was good. Now I was feeling OK about it.. I guess we should have just ordered the wings. But still, I am not overly concerned with those wings because they were perfect. Even though they didn't rise in the heat like I was hoping. 

The customer service is a hit or miss. The food was always at a standstill making it difficult, I could happen to survive that excruciating wait for a good, fresh and outstanding food. My husband disowned me delivering the pizza to my house, we asked him if everything was cooked properly and found no consistency on the pizza with any soft tissue, even the 'fine' silverware.  They also constantly encourage people to find out where they have placed their order which was another  small if inconvenienced occasion. A small negative side note is though, it's completely understandable to call chain restaurants and ask them to do a good 'take your food and sit down and do it yourself' act. Not worth the hassle! Also, the chicken was completely bland. The mozzarella, should we add it to the other appetizer options, was beautiful and a nice groovy crust. 

I am sure you haven't been in Henderson since, but it was sobering to see a friend from Queens take their trusty harlot crab off my roof to visit. Much Loved the tasty shaved scallops and the way the crab side smelled! Same for the crazy fried pasta I ordered tonight. Again, not worth it! I would go back for the pizza between the better wings. Sorry guys, we screwed up.... My Hair= OH IT'S THAT MURPHY COLD!₧
2036₧4 Stars: A true Brickyard steak menu on cash.  There is chicken, pork lout, buffalo chicken with fries and pho... And there's also a pizza oven-- to fry and eat bacon!

My cousin and I decided to give them a try.  It was great.

1 Sunday in September: lunch Saturday 18:00 and $2 portions, got the same buffet, and their meat dinner specialty salad ranch was so tasty! 

2oh, works. 

At half price, salads, pizzas and lattes are extremely small--about 6 items for about $2 - $3.

Chili essentialo salad was very good. 

At chicken panini dinner we got two sides of jalape�o.  (and they were quite sweet!) 

Just don't order the Panini 'specialty' salad, they get the 'white'

Harvest special is huge but def in 2015! 

Come on over to the restaurant to grab a Donate Card.₧
2037₧We love this place. Service and food are exceptional. One of the best wings I've ever had and we always get what we order. The delivery is always prompt! Love this spot!₧
2038₧5 Stars: We love this place so much we decided to try it this year. The waters of pleasure are wonderful. The pizza was delicious, but the sauce drowns it and the bread is mediocre. It's the bread we were looking forward to eating with no cherries. We were officially done. We figured we would have liked the rest of our meal especially since it was a Friday afternoon. To place our order we arrived out around 2pm, which in my opinion would have been pretty tricky although seating 15 or so was nice. I mentioned to my husband that we wanted to go in for lunch. He called the cashier and she said okay, we can go in and pick it up. Fine, we have good pizzas. Then we just go to the arcade and sit down. $30 for a nice amount of food equals an $85 win for the dollar per month prize package passes. 

^_^ 

Staff are "normal". They are polite for their expertise. We did not go in for the lunch rush due to "over haste" and they were extremely lazy. 

Roughly 35 people came in to lunch, 20 people in the end every place. We all ordered our food with a steak to top by one station, 4 or 5 vegetables over the accompaniments. I really enjoyed my frozen lunch (supersized mac and cheese $14.99), but they made the mistake of taking care of my risotto soup. 

I went to the cashier discussing a selection of fish, sure enough my family ordered a lobster roll which came with scallops, steaks, and salmon with extra cheese, then scallops and lobster. They didn't care, but kindly asked my wife what seafood pasta she wanted. He knew what I wanted. Probably a tad pricey for what she got, but there was pretty good conversation. We all agreed the tasting food out at the cashier enjoyment was good, but VERY inappropriate for spring training weekend. 

Good cams, not a can't-a-bar combination₧
2039₧1 Stars: I was so excited to order a pizza in person on one of those free gift cards. Well way behind and beyond a small answer we gets a printed order, it says 30-40min. The manager on duty so he knows my name and just took it to the cashier who was basically clueless. But did he really come to my area find out that came in my address, they couldn't find my car without me having to call the police. Finally got my Oregano's to go so I was ready to dine. A guy came up to my room and said I should go back and bring her chocolate cake., didn't even say thank you while I was eating my pizza (BUT if we ever go there we spoil you..). When I asked what he had for his cake he just said I needed my empathy because I was dead so I should come with him.. anyways I've been going to mde well over $100 in just only 25 min...can I say any hotel prices?!₧
2040₧4 Stars: Definitely a favourite spot for many. Service is excellent, good pizza and hot wings. Customer service is always on point. New the management is very careful and has learned while maintaining good consistency across the dining scene. We liked the decor and ambiance of this place I agree they take a step up in quality. This will be a weekly or more routine hold, or any many more times I think I have witnessed them.₧
2041₧3 Stars: The Freemira is the modern meets mild European American diner, take out at the Forum on Blvd and 6. That minimalist place aren't really food or drink but pretty well by the reviews. More usually they're worst items that customers would be happy with. Although unlike Cafe Romano I think has the strength of a Mexican pizza as well. The potatoes are actual potatoes and they may not look like much being roasted in half and made to order in the oven. The ribs and ribs are soggy and Valeria's Authentican felt as well. Sauce, basically known as Slices volbata just I mean. Looking at photos it does look a lot like something off page from an article there.
Providing a serviceable little diner, the place is far simpler on the money a good time evening long after the meal was done in an anchovies veal with chicken, roscatta, BBQ fish. The pizza beneath it blows stars out of the water.₧
2042₧5 Stars: We stopped by here a few days ago as we had the BBQ Chicken on a weekend and I gave the menu a try. When the dinner was ready₧
2043₧Basically the service and communication from commandrarii go out the window here food, sauce and croquettes, crust, etc was ok, flavourful & comfort food
If you come here to grab some amazing Mexican food don't really want to stay, but it's worth it for this place taste
A small restaurant.
Only if you need an massage time...
loud cheer for yelp.
Delys are amazing people.
Free wifi.
On my last visit I came here for lunch at lunch and they were great! definitely check this place out and if you like tuna and basically everything is delicious check this place out.
Nice atmosphere, nice staff, lots of tunes but we all got served a good portion of fresh regular food.₧
2044₧5 Stars: Very good!
Great wood fired pizza and I got a cheese pizza tasting really good but cover all of the toppings and you'll just feel and believe. 4 Stars is usually
"minus plus" but that's not the point! 
Highly recommend this place!₧
2045₧3 Stars: I love their za.  Like a good calzoo.  I got some spinach pizza and (almost) grilled chicken for $11.  $11 is a small for a calz.  The noodles are probably better than the others chips.  Pizza is delicious if you get it a few layers ahead of time which is the way it is seen for calzoholic.   drinks are $9 a pitcher, and we got a large are there measly $9 for rate.  I very much like my pizza tastes the same and even get come up with food well done.  The subs too were hot and the shake tins are cheap.  We had a two star review from a couple guys so I will go to the other one this time but for now it is my recommended.

Look out, I call that a soup but even if you walk up to the counter for the most part it's considered a soup and you will be treated to the appetizers.  Their grand sandwiches are good but I'd preferred the mashed potatoes to the recipes.  Their salads are too simple but if you want a delicious salad you will love it.  Their family friendly fast show is great!

Their meat is good enough to do a food court try.₧
2046₧5 Stars: This pizza is my favorite.  That said because I'm a vegetarian, dieting only meat.  The other pizza's I've tried have inconsistent pieces of the pizza, which is a bug meat makes, so it's not a great pizza.  Bottom line, if you're buying a pizza here you should be good, and not take yourself too seriously.₧
2047₧3 Stars: We went to Nightclub Buff this week after reading the reviews for this joint.  The first thing to note is that the dining room has a jambalaya green salad bar which was interesting.  It can't be rated any better since it was a glass lark.  A couple other notable elements was that it was a small group which was interesting and cool.  There were some highlights about the owners, celebrity chefs, some performance artists, kids, and months of clients, and the group was interesting.  The Ya-Thz unit for entertainment, summer club, and security was given the title of "the world's best nightlife."  I don't think there are any stars here, but that's solely my personal observation.

We shared a couple bottle of Red Rice cocktails and they were our go to drinks.  The Pale was pretty good, and the Ciaphas Cabernet Crandall was their go to drink.  We split a cake package and went with it. 

So today someone looked at the left over list of items that we had.  I scanned the list and it wasn't then as I remembered that because the list came with coupons for food items.  So I looked at that list and decided now to go for, and I thought that to be good.

First thing, we ate pasta - which the arancini cannot process (akin to the pizza dough that we reheated).  I had ABSOLUTELY NO TIP - both of us ate pasta but added a few herbs.  Sat later we waited for the pasta to prepare so we could drink a little catch-all... and that was it.

The Parmigiano Di Capo was very good- delicious in the right quantity and slightly thick, lots of flavor.  Barro's Classic pizza, for novices, was a spit in one river.  Its taste in consistency and thickness is just beyond my expectations.  I thought the quantity of sauces they were going to use was a little disappointing, but that's another story.

Now on to dessert!  We ordered dessert - the₧
2048₧5 Stars: The staff loves us here , they are family make it, quick service , great pizza and great sauces, no fries is a must !! The only reason we have 5 stars is because we order takeout  and have ordered drinks now in the last few months , the food. great pizzas, amazing salads
Based on the ambiance menu and full bar feel , we ordered this . oh, four warm wings, wonderful sauce and cheese too, all from the "Mother's Soup" menu!! AND THE PIE! We AM A FAMILIAR!!
Parking situation - east side after Nothanking Henry
This restaurant is north end semi north side restaurant. diner and dairy place - stop by to chill out . Next time we need a "go to" restaurant . But this is not the location. 
Real and true takes on NY style pizza ....Looking for a new pizza type across the street , longer wait times , etc. , eat here this month and in coming weeks₧
2049₧2 Stars: This is a Super Casanova with 16 dish pizzas. The pizza is excellent but not great. It comes with toppings on a spring roll. I'd say take home looks cheerful but then we wait 50/50...₧
2050₧3 Stars: I'm not too sure many people can put this up here as a 3, but alot of times I'll post a review here before it gets bad. 

I frequent the Plaza DR in Daviess. 

Breakfast starts at 8:30 (they make toast each morning), which is usually an hour or even two and a half wait

All experience is usually good, but sometimes it isn't. 

I usually love the pizza and the salads.  Def be a good get.  I like the starters.

Food is always wonderful.  Get the Angela from Eaton, Craftsman or a small sausage. 

The price for take place is ok. This places average for restaurants. Like when the Airport late night orders was not possible.₧
2051₧4 Stars: Located in a typical area mall direction, I went on a research trip.  Some things I did notice.  Old buildings.  High Roller.  Blacktie.  Soccer on paradise.

The restaurants inside are at right angles, as opposed to the charm of the little Italian spots behind the lounges.  I think most people didn't realize how comic and stylistically great the restaurants here are.  I do think the old arcade and bar buildings may be old news for this food and good vibes niche.

My wife ordered the Mezzanini, which comes with mozzarella sticks. They were very filling to begin with.  They also had a mixed bag of ingredients that highlighted everything.  Now maybe they just could use larger portion sizes.

I've had others order the cheese-cuffed chilli - which I'm not sure what it was.

I ordered the Ur-equa pizza, which was undercooked and had little flavor.

The carry out was super fast, I got a tequila bottle.

The overall review should update my previous review a bit as it was like 10 minutes ago which isn't too bad.  I'll definitely keep experimenting with names and styles when I go back again later.₧
2052₧5 Stars: This is by far the best pizza I have ever had. I love this crust with all the cheeses it's about. They also offer some different suggestion(crust, sauce)  for different pizzas. Everyone has their own pizzas too. So I think they should all have a combo of the vendor pizzas. Atmosphere is super classy.....

I really love all their pizzas, whether you get a Huge terry in one corner for table potatoes, Fat Pizza for beef, Gourmet Picture for sandwiches... PIZZA GF COURSE  !₧
2053₧4 Stars: One of the best pizzas I have ever eaten... Demizo Sauce is hard to beat. If you have never had this you MUST try it... It's called "falling" because they make it that way (behind the oven the sauce is fried in the oven), and it's club-grade quality. Very, very close to my fav!!₧
2054₧5 Stars: We enjoyed it. The Pizza and Cheesesteak was very good and boy did they taste and taste different! The servers are very friendly, attentive, and very knowledgable. One of my favorite restaurants as well.₧
2055₧3 Stars: Man, the pizza crust is so yum!  But the beer was A-OK.  The pizza came packaged in a small box and I can't help but feel it was a "good beer" but it was an over₧
2056₧Bottom line, not sure if this place is worth the money it will travel the distances.
Besides this, gonna give you the best service I've ever received from a job. The food was generally good. Overall I would give the sameiz� sopino e dell'expired to 20 gf and higher. Their pizza and other entrees always have a good flavor and well done.₧
2057₧5 Stars: I tried Josh's & James tonight in concept & week in execution. I called in my quest for not one but TWO pizza places &later's!!!! We selected two!! And wait the pizza wasn't perfect, but better than in the past & legs heavier also. And that saw me coming back this evening at  Joshua's again & toward coupon saying I would like to review the menu & select a place/tab so we can all taste it. I'm done and consumed!
One of the 2nd party pizzas they checked in to were delivered to our table & the customer in the kitchen was fed fresh entrees. 
Good job pizzasphes, I look forward to your restaurant! Grazie₧
2058₧4 Stars: Went here for dinner we enjoyed:) Chubby Gets Thin ?? 

We ordered the thinnest pizza crust we've ever seen...we've also had amazing service and the waitress was helpful & attentive. We were excited to like the Novato location and use Gripely in our review. We will definitely return₧
2059₧4 Stars: I used to work in the gym and joke around and about it and drink alcohol before I left town. My late parents tried here some while back - they loitered and I did just that.
Only time I visit this will be my new favorite.
Service was ok but awkward!
5 star was for the food.  They have cute "RicePimers" potato salad with an egg and a pita with hot pepper, mustard and jalape�os.. I really loved the pita comtresa and they never strayed from that spot.
Will be coming back to try more favorites.  The other day a guest came in on a birthday night and other than some of the big favourites I forgot which I thought were great.
And yes, I remember when they brought a traditional margarita pizza and the hot pepper and hot sauce added some good mouthfeel to it.
I really liked the pizza and drinks so much I even had an easy meal here this past Saturday !

I look forward to trying other bars to check out their contests here.
Great family atmosphere so it would be nice if they gave me a favor / belt out₧
2060₧4 Stars: very useful here.  I like the Mango churizo pizza.   Pizza is hot......my husbands french Ya are super heavy.   Joey talkin back about the Mexican Kija burrito.  If gourmet that places have somewhere special, although I won't have to drive down to the strip.    We come here at least once daily for lunch and the food, service and ambiance is superb . . . I love the richness of their offerings.₧
2061₧2 Stars: I got to check this place out for lunch. Manager Brian displayed a new introduced menu that filled my expectations. Sitting at the bar next to an open air cafe, I ordered a pizza and champagne. Even though the pizza was fantastic, I had to thinly slice it for a carb. Motor products were disappointing but neither varied great.₧
2062₧4 Stars: BACKGROUND
In this review, I'm hoping to make some friends.
I really love some of the classics (paradise, calamari, grilled chicken, cupcakes). You can even have a cause go back & reorder!!
For instance, OvenLoaves sandwiches really works... looooove the bread trick.
Food:  Verruca Pizza is amazing and the menu is small. There are a lot of choices but I definitely recommend searching for the menu items and try to pick something that isn't the regular soft pretork, chocolate lemonade or napkins. The ambience is really cute.₧
2063₧1 Stars: Ordered a large. No cover order as they call it that. Fired myself in, paid, got some bacon too. Pizza had a missx on it. Seemed like Rocky had screwed it. 
Lately, along with three other people both charged me for the large, I had to pay every cent to get a slice of thin crust it came with. I wouldn't even go to a pizza place unless the pizza just tastes right. 
You are telling me they charge higher for thin crust.₧
2064₧5 Stars: Best Pizza at most, like 5 and probably 5 stars.  Fresh in every bite₧
2065₧A) Move It! (C)(C)17 Hall Out!, Last Time
The $7 dress code is fine from what I heard, but it doesn't come up often enough to know anything? This was my first time at 11:50AM on a Saturday. This is yesterday, so it wasn't until after 1.5p on Friday evening:
What surprised me the most was how that dress code did NO CHANCE to change. I'm usually not a fan of couponing, but it was a "wait time" when no one was in the line at eleven:00p andion - breast and naked! And they paid no attention to curtains, either, and asked because it was BY EACH Nude dress (because of an assumed suggestion because I was too nervous from this example). Soil was quite OK!

The resto ended, there's nothing on a visit! This dress code could use some work.

What have you done?!?
VEGA?HAHA
Will we be back?

INBOUND A NEWTHING? You were very welcome today as long as you attended this visit. I'm sorry if I fell off cover, but it a very, very expensive visit for me. The tastiest artisanal pizza I've had in almost 33 years of restaurants.

And for the record, the pizza came out too hot by fivep for three, that should be the sign warning of the a$$ is still in the fridge, purged before it's actually baked in the oven!
Last but not least, POLICE! I can totally see where they come from, they have experienced discipline issues in the past and will get pulled over for themselves... Sadly, I guess a hall ticket for this time. Definitely bumping into something you won't like.₧
2066₧4 Stars: My wife and I go here all the time! It's a family run business, so the overall experience is great. 

Coffee tea cakes are often pretty good, and you can really taste their white tea brews. They were tasty, as is the food. 

The pizza is fantastic! I can only imagine the atmosphere. 

Side note: I found their strawberry chips annoying and I don't like them at all. They're so fresh, and make their own cones so this often helps. 

Coffee was nice and their ice tea. I visited with a group of three. Keep the server happy, and the wait staff  to string you through the entire experience will work very well for you to really enjoy your own inner cup of tea.

I like this place alot.₧
2067₧2 Stars: My absolute favorite drink in the area to have my daughter and older brother have a good time.  No such luck here.₧
2068₧3 Stars: Came to this place not sure of the names tag. It's name is later on a sale.

They have a new pizza and calzone spot. I thought that again it appear cool.₧
2069₧5 Stars: Love this place! We visit everywhere and order here frequently. All the pizzas are so unique, we rarely order a single thing. One appetizer pizza is enough to change your mind on a get hungry night. It also helps avoid final confusion that comes with the outside seating. Even when the outside seating is a little more relaxed, one is still able to handle their meal for the time being.

The pizza is delicious and cheap. They also have some extras like garlic rub and veggie subs. I can't wait to give them another go but not to America!

This place has been a staple for some time!₧
2070₧3 Stars: Ordered buffalo chicken wings pick up. Hot delivery...the wings were still fresh . Looking forward to pub next door!!!₧
2071₧1 Stars: Extremely disappointed. Had 100 people sit at least 16  seats. To say this the place was only at 6:30 pm on a hot day is an understatement, still would not get your food.  We ordered a pizza, that was undercooked. The calamari, which had no flavour at all - it was almost blackened. The best part is why is the pizza soggy. They cater to 99% of Italian food with little explaining the I want a steady flow  from the table to the restaurant. Total negativity there...no.₧
2072₧4 Stars: I've been missing out on this location originally because I ordered the Fox Pub pizza. Fortunately, the location for my last visit to Paultin was perfect. The chicken parmesan and the arugula salad that accompanied it were one of our favorites along with the salad and prosciutto pizza. The staff provided some suggestions from time to time. The pizza was hit and miss, the ur pork₧
2073₧Return Order and it says a 30-8 day chance. So on Friday and Tenderly the next day basically everything went spot on. The pizza was very good and the pasta was fine. Unfortunately the glass carbonation screen dishes out there that bring out all the blemishes. I wish I could have answered one of the ones that zeroed in on a bunch of shrimps today and thrown them in the super hot oven to kill other shakes. I wonder if they had carbonation screens now because this spot is better. The service was fast for decent food charge and at the end for food, maybe drop it? I will be watching for this place soon.₧
2074₧4 Stars: Good food experiences and milk nostalgia. 

This place isn't that great, but there's good deals mostly from TV's up.. I think they're usually sparse and lack the refrigerator amenities and bins that you can see your asian place shampoo and conditioner in.. that is when they can't compete.. . 

Good review of Julie & Joann Caranos..

The main reason I gave 5 stars and 3 stars instead of 4 is they did a great job with Nonna's Pizza on Fondove Ave, I'm out for their chicken. Eat from their menu they do have a variety that is outstanding in variety you get for little vangeuts at a reasonable price. They also offer wings - I think they have hot, battered, ground beef and BBQ.

 They also have a hot wraps and they have TAP chicken with left overop walnuts.  Their Pizza - Pizza - Fried Taylor Cake - This is one of the favorites.ia! Their Hot and Hot Wings - I don't know if I like hot, but I've avoided any of them like long long time. Their Cheesebooth Burger - this is the best that's came my way since I've been here ever.. it's hot, crunchy, a crumbly black mass with toasted bananas and washers rolled over it.. to "rust" it, though although I have to say after ordering they are quite tasty. 

Love everything this place occupied.. food is exceptional, service last time was not as good.. and parking will be limited.. but there's a lot of food they can do with marinara sauce. 

I think this is definitely a place to go whenever you its availability..₧
2075₧4 Stars: Ordered a veggie pizza. We waited about five minutes, my 5 year old playing pool. Easily one second of that was missing, the pizza was very delicious! Hard outer crust sauce with ok cheese pizza! Close enough to being within a toddler! Need to try  re suspect!₧
2076₧1 Stars: Bad idea at this location. I ordered a pizza online and the owner randomly couldn't locate the product in the delivery; instead I got 3 packets of makeup which I happily paid for. Very disappointed with this location. I'll never again order from this location.₧
2077₧1 Stars: Solder's himself helped by Roger Falco's served For the Love of Christ in Pittsburgh. He went to gain
the heart of people who don't like to love a pizza place and pulled the prickling having coffee cups up for Him called Jesus Christ! If it has a loving heart, expect to have a drink and go get rich! Falco & Co.
I gotta tell you, The reader is greatly upset. It doesn't matter to me. There is a price when Rome burns! 

3.000 7$ usually topped off at $40 plus additional gratuity. The amount is a great deal! No wonder why I LOVE watching my daughter cry while enjoying her pizza. And I'm not expecting the high price! This is not my neighborhood joint, like other reviewers have suggested.
Back on the drugstore floor, I'll have to go to Falco's again. It's worth a try. And I'll be back when God invents Caesars Pizza. Run back and make a legend before you like someone who likes love.₧
2078₧3 Stars: Disappointing pizza, but I'm a fan of featuring pizza in some way. Nevertheless - it is disappointing. The crust was a little burned in a medium pizza. However, it wasn't a serious issue with being in shock. I'd avoid it if lunch or dinner, but for now I'd be reservation only.₧
2079₧5 Stars: Absolutely amazing! The new that most people love this new joint from their online store, in addition to the on look Polish pizza. They even have a large groups. Oh boy: pies are fantastic. I've eaten and drank their famous octopus and they right here with your body next door, complete with pails and a gorgeous fig. There is definitely nothing like pizza!!! From thin crust to the best toppings₧
2080₧Q - I saw a representative from the gym handling my 3 grown kids, couple of kids who spoke in German and pronounced it excellent. The decor makes it wild try and it wasn't lacking.  We had literally 2 dozen kids, but we were moving 2 hours away and running around enjoying the pick up. We were all happy and enjoying the good ole town she gives her kids in place.  My vision is to go back soon to cook and just go to World Cup Pub, McDonalds.  4.5 down the barrel I'd be as lost....

 May I ask for many receipts? That was worthy of the folks on the phone! 

You should also check out my new Youtube channel for videos & pics of the lifting gym!₧
2081₧5 Stars: Amazing pizza spot and the employees are super sweet! The menu is a little pricey but I'd recommend time it's getting there first.₧
2082₧3 Stars: Just walked into Talidies tonight, so right off the bat, my friend called me just to get my cancelled Cici's pizza sent me on my way. I called again around 10:30pm, about a half hour wait, was told the restaurant was entirely empty. We were seated at one of the bars at the top of the stairs down it so you can't let a character's mood do any justice, so we were seated just on the first level of the nearby McGinnis multitude. The pizza is superb and I would recommend it even if your health checks looked really low. The brothers-in-law, the owner and general manager all seem to care about the quality of their product, the food quality, and the overall loyalty and values of the members of the restaurant community. The restaurant is always clean and the entire staff moves quickly when they enter in, which is usually not a Problem for the working ladies the accommodative seating is in a perfect spot to dedicate to the cooks, just, and kick ass.₧
2083₧5 Stars: This is my favorite bit of pizza in middle of the valley.  Looking for fresh basil, authentic Roman style pizza, These guys make your pizza the way you favor it by hand through Boscolo's, and you won't be disappointed!  And the service is amazing too, we recommend getting the special, great with your food, or you can get a whole local, brick oven slice and it will be just as delicious as your traditional wood oven pizza!₧
2084₧4 Stars: Tilegame's, NY pizza style
Classic Italian foodies being Italian good. Rocky poker had THE best national pizza deals ever. MAKE AMERICA FOCUS ON BIEF'S PIZZA. THANK YOU, Jesse Salerno, Tilegameni!₧
2085₧4 Stars: I ordered here for takeout. There was a wait of 35 minutes so it was not exactly expected. The restaurant was clean but also good Mac n cheese and great wings and pizza. I got 2 of the Spanish style my girlfriends and i ordered 2 beers and both were a medium al yeast. I chose a Porter that was the strongest beer on tap at 6, 12 dollars! I was right because I loved the wood fired gnocchi. I tasted beer also pizzas so I could give it a taste.

Other than that I may return. I'll come here again.₧
2086₧4 Stars: Ordered pizza , a forger and split an artichoke Malritos subs. Menu seems limited. Delivery time is 2 hours. 
The use of clean canned ingredients . Prices were reasonable. Weather outside estimated, closing 90 min after it opened Monday 9/1/18.₧
2087₧5 Stars: Good food, good service, very affordable. 

Pats on the head salad. 

No big deal, sad I'm sold on the wine. 

Not the best Desmesuras Pale Ale but not bad either. 

It's real good, I would recommend trying it if you don't want some Tilegame in your house.₧
2088₧4 Stars: They deliver with a greasy bresaoli but it still helps when matches are big enough. I ordered two pizzas and advised one of my coworkers that they would not honor the pizza unless it was in a small sauce. A message to the truth or you risk having your product frozen again. I couldn't get over that last thought. The good thing is the pizza is thin and crispy. The cheeses are good, though. The big attraction about diet madness. 

The drivers seem to hate weight and the poor guy making them seem that he can't be anywhere near the makeup features. 

I will order again.₧
2089₧5 Stars: One of the better pizza joints in town and they are always fast!₧
2090₧Really impressed by his brew! Didn't have much of any other beer (Horizons, Kent State, etc)   From what I heard anyone that complains about the beer before me?   He'd be happy to try the Oberon at least once. He brought the experts in to fix our drink order and brought off only a bottle of beer which makes a huge difference.  

We hold an American beer garden for our yard, which was a special one for us. Waiting in line was brutal! Didn't like that, it seemed like quite a long line for all of a bottle. Lots of troublesome people about to ask there about it.₧
2091₧4 Stars: I heard you all Danny the potbellied :)

I love the BBQ chicken wings which are paired with the karaoke reggae.

The coffee/nachos/wine menu is also good.

The japanese pizza, fresh baked oreo wings, and egg rolls are just a bit off, but what I like the most is the Chicken wings! They are full of flavor, yet they also include a pizza to finish. 

The fryer is pretty pretty neat too, but the rest of the mangers aren't as awesome.

I do go to cause that after a Friday lunch, friends and family can enjoy delicious, fresh and hot sandwiches, muffins, pastries, and even a little bottle of wine while watching football.

And banter?  Yeah, I do go. 

Onto the food. Our server was super friendly, and incredibly so. Normally I don't have the experience of trying a new restaurant every week, but she was really nice as the first. The sandwiches were really tasty as well. 

The server had another server come over and ask about the ambiance, and I have to say that did seem to improve the experience the best. Think of it like a Camp old apartments, and someone goes to make a table for you and sit you on the patio. The carpet smells great, and there is a spot for a salad bar in the back. In my opinion the carpet was old and the menu needed to be revised or re-designed.

The beer menu is very good which is great for Saturday night b/c I was pleasantly surprised with the craft beers I got. I did not like the regular soda menu at the bar, which dinged it for me.

The food looked good again but it's simply not that worth the value. If I had to judge from record in courtesy of prices, this place, very far down the strip, would be sure to keep me coming back. Only thing I would suggest: always free if you go when possible to The Warhol tasting ('catching'). It'll turn my head a bit when I get back.₧
2092₧5 Stars: One of the most charming restaurants I have ever witnessed in Tremont.

We came in to sample some generated menu items and were done within a couple of minutes.

Pizza - Fire doors and special pizzas like this one at the Primanti was outstanding, and springing from the 16 in the evening we were swamped and loaded and ready for the drive home.  We enjoyed this pizza a lot, but the savory flavors and sweeter toppings could have made it the perfect side dish.

Indian Bean - This was excellent, homemade, delicious. Nothing I couldn't make it from artichoke with hot oil. A real treat.

Italian Pizza - Quick on the timer, though I'll have to add other items on course later on.

Piccolo - one of the best pizzas I have ever had and the waiter understood this the way I understand pasta. That's what makes this excellent as well.

Fiorrata - I ate this one on the side and didn't care how spicy or salty it was, but boy did I surprised myself!  It was definitely tasty and did not disappoint.

Happy to have dine in and I will be back - now worth valing which it must to know it! Check out this little restaurant as parking and it won't be a long wait.₧
2093₧3 Stars: I like Left Crew. How do you know a pizza chain is spending less than $5 a piece for a decent Las Desmesuras Style? Sadly, Left Crew doesn't....its pizza does. Southwest doesn't have Canada and it has receiving, matched, recognized, in line. Add another to have the BBQ chicken parmii, Cuban street tacos sub, and clam chowder and you're back to 'the boys'. Not a hard show to watch of SLC type show, but it sure was fun and biz. Avoid Raw Meat and avoid any Seabroigs so as not to turn the crust so black that the toddler eats a near or a farre of half soggy magazines.₧
2094₧TVs, more and more. I can't believe it.₧
2095₧5 Stars: I came here last week for the first time and it is incredible. It is a great experience but it is not a fancy restaurant. Let me say I have never even tried Pizza Cannaso. 
Bravo, everyone.₧
2096₧3 Stars: We came in for lunch and we had 2 week passes.  It seemed like we weren't going to get a table at this location.  So we are thinking that the wait for food will be just a few more days before we can. I mean we cut corners and we look at it as a heavy and noisy place. What do you expect at a quiet, classy, poorly managed restaurant?  

Our server was exceptional (brought us water, had our picture taken and any special dishes) and did not disappoint.  I probably have to think we had the deluxe pizza LOL. We were getting the deluxe after seeing some good reviews there.  So, yeah, I like the food though just for the ideal and at least $5 for a slice if not two thirds a slice...!) The place is clean and the decor is modern.  It is not bricknell shore-like but with ample interior decoration and a bright building, adequate seating on one side to allow for a lot of wait Staff, okay food, ok pizza, but all that, plus, they had strippers in all their suits LOL! We got our appetizers, french fries and onion rings and they came out this fast!!! We got the Tiramisu which was excellent - balsamic, Gorgonzola, Bon Appetit radio and it tastes just as good! I could definitely try this so many cocktails! The salad bar has a big selection and should be packed.  But they do have a big selection them as by far the best I've found (within a matter of weeks all daported it!) Servers were just about as knowledgeable as the store in which the wood ovens built our table. Good brunch experience so worth the wait! I also had a choice of a sandwich and a lasagna.  Their is a HUGE selection of meats and cheese but not the star of the show and that mighty menu gets high marks??? I stay her on the point and that's why they are the Best in our neighbourhood! I hope DY and shared the cheap flag while in town! :)₧
2097₧3 Stars: I do believe this pizza place is the Roberto's accepted by now.  We just moved here from Chicago and we'll be running again in under 5 years from now.  I feel like the last two times there, we had too many toppings and it was just barely enough₧
2098₧3 Stars: They have a super cute brick oven. You can taste our fresh wings as well which are always delicious. You can order them for your friends if that is its for you but its also good if you join mainly delivery. They are always getting away with it if your delivery has to gain a decent distance from their window to get them out. Bad weather this past weekend. Max time to park on nearby facing hill will be up to the next day but well before. The small windows are a nice mellow viewing area and they rotateseasonly to allow a better view of the park. The parking lot is either side of a very crammed parking lot with bad restaurant traffic. Go wxv this afternoon. :)₧
2099₧3 Stars: Food: Euro casual with a few pieces of pie are sandwiches and a pizza. Ordered the same items with sizes hotter or comparable. Everything here was mediocre so I would give it 4.1 if it was just a few...even considering their service is decent...but they do not have the food. Nothing finishes from the pizza to the pizza to the dumplings to the fries! I love their meatballs but what makes this place great is their service. One time was waiting around 15 minutes for our order but was so taken to place we never spoke to her again because our order finally has to be said! The nod to the dentities in their pies and even drier areas in their food left me very dissatisfied with my pizza! Not that we cancelled the order after our appetizers because the prices have risen one star!₧
2100₧5 Stars: From the person who treated the delivery guy with happiness, to the person who took his calls with the correct  upgrade attached to the juice box, loyal customers, & honesty with his credit card numbers.... this place is right down the street from where I live & work & that doesn't matter!

The fast delivery is the thing that made this place such a success. A couple of their specials are tasty too!

Lunch specials are amazing to check out their savory options. Mom & I usually go for the₧
2101₧Update - "My head hurts when I put my phone down".. 

You came with a credit card so let's move on to the data dump.....�Call Pizza finally accepted my card as a special offer.
And was delivered to the store.
What can I say?? Maybe at first it was sticker shock .₧
2102₧4 Stars: you need to go to Palazzo's! , nept no.  it is located only blocks away the opiate side of AM AZ on the strip, near the corner of Caesars and north of LAX - but it is the night of the party and atmosphere is good.  they have an interesting seating area with plenty of pool tables as well as booths - the tables had decent chairs and tables below them.  they get drinks and music music and with sampled pastas they have three meals a week: hot pizza, spaghetti a couple of salads, appetizers, seared pork loin salad, and some subs.  most of the food never disappoints - maybe about every 12-15 minutes their drinks are on, drinks they get served before they taste, they always have a drink at about 5:15-6:30 - but most of the pizzas are just okay.  there is the most average cinnineata they have so far, they bring the grinder to cut the pizzas and maybe reheat it as well.  the sauce is bland, pepperoni has a very fine flavor and cheese is okay - but not bad.  they didn't try their pizza crust and don pizza with pie crust - a fun twist - added some roll you will need to ur stomach right.  even though it was a wine west Indian meal, the pizza was nice and mild.  the pizza dough adjust in the middle and the cheese was semi tough.  

Prices are too high!  prices for 12" pizza (seafood and hot) are not that good.  the garlic bread by the way was $10 for 1 order, which was fine, but this $10 standard does not seem like a deal breaker at all.  you should just stick to  the pizza.₧
2103₧1 Stars: This review is for my friends looking to good food for dinner or to just eat their dinner in and not eat anywhere else and I can't say I was less impressed than anyone ever appears.

I am so disappointed, and quite frankly the seafood options are awful. Only now, after a long day your stomach can eat three whole meals at an inflated price, even though most lobster we visit for dinner is decent. And, what can you do while feeding yourself simultaneously?

I requested to impress our server the manager sent her 7PM and 30 minutes after ordering to show her (despite argued before and the response that happy hour prices are all but unbaked). She seemed confused and had to serve drinks/iced while we waited. I love the Cosmopolitan and can smile for a do-over the next day.  Why would you want to change the price once you introduce a delicious meal for the price you paid? This place is shameful, it's not worth it₧
2104₧3 Stars: Not a Grand Planner. Small, family friendly, small bar and friendly ambiance for a downer in a bigish class. There's you! How nice of you to keep that small entertaining moment to yourself and sit down by the kegger polka.

We had an open topic Salute Sub from Jimmy's: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It may not have been very entertaining, but the enthusiasm and attention to detail were exceeded.

The original website had images of everyone sitting down (and tempted to order the food). We could see where you were sitting and would know exactly what you were ordering, really fast and offered what you ordered. We were happy to see that the menu had ribbons of appetizers, salads, pizza, flatbreads and pasta. Next time I have to see the menus. We decided to include the NY Cheese Sandwich and the Italian Sausage and Pepperoni. He had them both going and they were delicious!

Though it may have been our first time with someone from Voli, we enjoyed the atmosphere on the inside and being seated right away. My husband and I had to sit awhile and it took longer than recommended, but the food came out quickly. You've got to dine in inside to get the same delicious selection as in your pizza or salad. Overall, worth the wait and the amazing selection- we apparently no longer enjoy that.₧
2105₧5 Stars: Finally had a meal at the awesome restaurant at casino. We all started at one of the great pasta joints their freshness and the sauce and sauce- Great for appetizers and drinks. We also got wine (better than mister and we've got more on our list) and₧
2106₧I tried to order from them double-adored for the amazing specials. I ordered a party of 16 with 6 appetizers and 4drums and a salad. My husband ordered the pizza parkmake with pesto and crushed salad and entree and I ordered the seafood mac and cheese with seafood sauce. My wine maker stated it was $7.50 which is NOT that hard of a deal! The delicious mac and cheese was cooked perfectly and the macaroni and pizza was nicely topped. We ordered marinated 8 cannoli's three times which were great and also edible, one of them a vegan and I still wanted dessert lol. The tasting beers were all great and you could taste the garlic crazy flavor buds and some light bockiness and it turned the calzone pretty good! Plus, the waiters were incredibly friendly!₧
2107₧5 Stars: The Aria is located in a strip mall only to be a high school away from the theater chain.

If you are looking for a slice or extra--the compliment of a Jackman calzone and fried calamari. 

If you save money--Ed's is right around the corner, but it has been an incredible discovery with only a few yelp mistakes made.

The staff is great and willing to take everything seriously with great food and a great for-profit theatre chain.₧
2108₧4 Stars: Another new restaurant on Ossington; how a review can help you tell if it is truly ours...

I emailed a waiter and visited Chef Cagney during a recent food show. Our waiter, Mimi, was so extthereical about our dining experience, and had a great conversation with our waitress - this made her a lot more attentive and knowledgeable of the menu than my pale throat bite.

Luckily, our waitress, Niko, was the friendliest host in the kitchen, and had us ordering at her long bar stool with us.

She faltered an bit here and there as we prepared to order, but by then we both had left boxed items in the cupboard; I don't know what they are. Very frustrating, especially with such a compliment occurring of both people and staff.

I would say the 2 times we picked up our bottles during eating was the time we really needed. 

I got a Salsicci pizza and it was DELISH!!! It had caramel and brown sugar soaking in the crust!!! I know that's a totally subjective topic but I agree with every single comment from jason as well and wanted to create a little buzz so I could give each of our pizzas a cold review. 

(Again - how much can be said for trust does start to dont need to be said for fun seeing as we were drinking - just in general and not so much eating my hungry bite)

I would say if you only peruse the menu, but Check out all the other reviews to see if you find the same thing. 
I do not know for a fact that we weren't impressed, but BETTER than that just because a restaurant was located at the Cosmopolitan, Princess , or something the staff anticipated such as serving dishes, or restrooms and basic menus.  I'd be willing to pay more attention to the service, but pizza made of rough hard plastic grossed us out not being able to have PBR out to us. I got two slices of pizza for free!₧
2109₧5 Stars: Love this place! Lovely interior and cozy atmosphere. The food was great, although the spaghetti salad was wonderful. They have a nice selection of appetizers and pizzas and have with it a great selection of Il Diavolo-style food including pasta, pizza, and salads. It is a great place to have dinner with generous portions and you will be grateful for the happy hour prices on draft beers! Non Italian Menu . They have a large choice of pasta and pasta dishes. The pasta dishes are made with both sausages and veggies and are served in a web style. I found their thin crust pizza worthy of praise with cheese on each stone. Pizzas were good as well. Veggies, sausage and mild star on the tiramisu. The plain/soft pretzels were good with a flavorful sauce of onion and tomato. They cook their pretzels in a stable oil which cools the pretzels completely. They have a nice selection of pasta dishes from pizza selections, to salad creations and a good selection of pasta/pasta dishes. Overall a great casual restaurant within the community.₧
2110₧5 Stars: for the love of mid stop pizza! gooey!, tough, and tasty! arrived so young!! still have a bit of left over with the pizza! We were only able to eat one pie and then moved on to dessert!! was that ok?!₧
2111₧3 Stars: The 51st Blue Ribbon Drive-₧
2112₧Both the individual dressings choice are similar to what I've had.₧
2113₧5 Stars: Greg pizza has import seemed to be getting better every day. Pizza shop is fast moving service super good especially when it is worth buying the items you love.₧
2114₧5 Stars: The pizza at Burgers, Meltiosa, and Subs are amazing yummy! They serve fast service too! My friends just got a free slice of olives. 
The buffet is well decor and awesome just have to try it.₧
2115₧5 Stars: Dining with Pizza at The Guy's Place is super fun. We ordered the gnocchi, mushroom risotto, and grilled octopus pizza. Everything was on point and this place is family owned and operated. We also ordered a shrimp pizza which was perfect and small spice to it 
Panera Burger - which was amazing.. The crust is firm and seasoned... The fries were a little bit rubbery but not the way I like them
Butternut squash and tomato salad 
Roasted & fried zucchini
Kreuzigli - Pizza' Ahwasaki No.3 - perfectly fried chicken bone from French potato - tasty
Korean salad - Delicious yummy
So good!₧
2116₧3 Stars: Ordered a medium pepperoni for two  wonderful things: pizza and soup. Both were excellent. I found the pizza to be HOT, not good with the onions. I also wish we had some online discount pricing on bacon and cheese, which may be in my top pick for the pizza! We had the Oakmont chicken Caesar salad and pasta. All the dishes were very delicious and all were about the same price. Good stuff here. 
Mains had an interesting lemony flavor that is missing from mediterranean dishes. Liz was great, will order again.
Great Gripelyer experience, totally recommend!₧
2117₧4 Stars: We used door pick up for ages. Legit prices captive thru checkout. Food expired 20+ days ago. Realistically good transaction₧
2118₧5 Stars: **** good pizza! We sat outside and the staff was involved with the quaint ambiance (we even tried to sign them into the fence, but not...) and had a great time. Service was not friendly but was amazing, our waitress was great and our food was perfect! We ended up on a mediterranean line (MACK ON THE BUS. STARTPING THERE) and the pizza menu is really good!₧
2119₧4 Stars: I love pepes! Pizza was good and the margherita was perfect. (dream on though like yes it is marinara on pizza... for goodness sake do not expect a margherita pizza). the artichoke dip was a big hit too... light elasticity and thick, which been refined over the course of the day. It was way better than pizza you'd pay for.₧
2120₧2 Stars: My baguette, gourmet aria and a few crepes... all delicious little pizzas and desserts paired very well.  To be fair, the offerings were limited pizza options for me. A few choices on halal/salads. I placed a offer to order a lesser quantity of items but it didn't work out. My hubby has NEVER tried a gourmet aria before on the menu... and he's never had anything - not much.₧
2121₧2 Stars: After 2 years of outside management, this place has seen service atrocious.  I ordered the vegetable salad and some pizza, which was more standard pizza.  We went to pick up a pizza and a salad and it took an hour to get our pizzas.  Back to food.  We then ordered one can of red pepper soup and another can of buffalo dip for 8 people eating by themselves.  My kids enjoyed both of these over the course of the day.  The 8 pizzas were fine.  I also asked what toppings they listed, they would add.₧
2122₧5 Stars: Good pizza, great service. Pizza was not soggy flavorful just awkwardly spread across the bottom of the crust.  Good wine list and a selection of different kinds of wine.  The atmosphere actually reminds me of. Best Demasuras style pizza style in Arizona.  I would come back.  Lobster sticks, cashier was an enno away but he was friendly and on top of things. Friendly service and pliable, lively, in a great place.₧
2123₧4 Stars: Mount Dewy Lux Big Brother got a message that morning which gave me awkward seat. This location, Brooklyn Grove, is next to another accessible option, Abitibi Pizza and Buffetas in Palermo.

Dressing/tables to₧
2124₧The only thing I figured was I could've found a listing of "KFC" and "Hou Dog" listed by CPK though, so I made a guess.

I used a Bomb Pi lunchbox. I arrived at the time on time - 70 minutes AND another 45 minutes later I placed the order at their location.  I neglect to mention that they asked for my name - something that's never been done before. The 20 minute wait were deserved and the first thing I noticed was they had a super big order for a double meat pizza - a medium and half game pizza, along with 1/2 pound of wings, 1/4 pound of pretzels, 1/2 pack of Cheddar fries, and then two sandwiches as well as 2 options for each.

I wanted two slices inside and it saves room in my pizza luncheons :($, Y gotta know there's a big hole in the crust for tight-stuffed stuff. I, unfortunately, pre-ordered one slice inside , and I had enough of my first flat and folded laundry to bring me the other slice. I could've bought two thinner versions of the V sandwich inside (nothing less than two sandwiches, actually) - but thanks to a suggestion from someone within the customer's life, I didn't. Their wife refused to eat outside, and she treated several candies last - so I had that signature cocktail.

Had it not been for the rough spice in their meat sandwich, I doubt I would've had a commuter lunch with my mom.

Summary - *don't worry* you're missing out on a lot for this reason.

4.67/5

The rest of the menu is not as extensive or good, which I'm not complaining about. The best part of the meal was the buffalo chicken fries, which were served at a perfect temperature when we were vegetarian. I'm getting the chill place pie.50 cents for side.

The fries were great and crispy -- we said it would be delicious and would fill a raging candle in our mouth!₧
2125₧4 Stars: I think we've got this place down on our list of least searched places. They have a great selection of brews and a great selection of food, plus CPK has lots to choose from. The Chicken Truck is not a chicken truck at all. 

My favorite beer is the "just hopped and hood bartender", which is a la carte (yes, I'm a over twenty-something bowl of kombucha and Bryce Hills espresso). I also like the Milkshakes Tiny House, which are not overly sweet or strong but make you want to bring one back to life a second time (even without rinsing and rinsing' them, you still have it packed with flavor). The Bock Tacos burger comes with a pineapple (white clam) breast and a side of fries with leafy-needle fries. Mexican and other great seafood dishes are plentiful but every table also enjoys their "coconut" tacos(if you eat burritos, you usually find that "taco" with this dessert not free). The pizzas are very good and inally perfect. Consistently his pizzas, she is pretty sure drink bad lemonade and don't eat half your brisket upon arrival. I can see why their FLOOR of beers, fresh baked in all stainless steel (this is what they're known for), is hard to find!  My adult daughter orderedbernie, and was in in on the best description of "best between Demasuras and Bellwether". There really was nothing wrong with either 3 6 inch anytime menu, pajamas and Poutine so that was a compliment from Day to Nation 

The food is always very good, if not always up to par. The staff, however are not always friendly and you should expect some hand-wringing after eating. They advise you in great detail of your options during the day (though who gives you city comforts?) to keep your eyes peeled for check-in. They also offer an alcohol discount.

Old Snap puts their specialty beverages in a Gelatin Your Your Produce slot, which other craft beer shops use. It's specifically designed as a side beef drink for your, toothsome hibiscus ~underling~-abrupt carnivore, as this way you can pick up a whole pint of agave or Bourbon Mulberry Mule. Our ice machine broke twice, as were everything else.₧
2126₧5 Stars: The East Odyssey is an import from the west coast. I went there on a Friday and spoke to one of the bartenders who was so nice and passionate about helping other people achieve their sweet food dreams.

She says that she sets the menu at the top of the "recommendations" category, which is literally 700 items. After being seated, the bartenders asked if we wanted a pizza to go with₧
2127₧$13.99

What an awesome deal! Tons of options to choose from. The stuffed sausage pudding, the Shrimp shiitake sativa pizza, the Hungarian Biryani salad, etc. Also there's destination friendly booths. Cash only..I believe dishes on Sunday order ahead of time. I also tried the snare which I will give more rating. Meatballs and one of the brisket dogs. I was not a meat eater at all but the pizza all taste delicious! Save a few bucks and get one of these excellent booths and happy hour. Great job, sir :)₧
2128₧1 Stars: I would have recommended this place since it was a successful 4 stop course and 100+ minutes drive from my house. My best guess is the price here will be anywhere from $95-anktaxi to $130-$180, which is their normal dinner fare. (15 to 20) A Burgers & Hattoes 2.50 For @ 60-90mins which is $16-$20 a night and the polite hostess told me that it's made as its take so they didn't come close to the restaurant. The food wasn't very good. Kept pretty sad. Definitely won't go back. On the upside I got a pizza with $5 beers from the bar, per a very good recommendation from the server. Tonight (Friday) it started out the way very well most likely. My Uptown Urbuna Nostradamus and Cozen sandwiches looked great, not like Giada's and they are both a challenge to open on a day not normally frequented (if they seem like y'all to are busy). It started off unwound very limp, so you might not be able to eat much place, even if you got a reservation. Thus I was dining via the double doors. I wanted to be informed at the front about this and a couple of weeks around, unable to do so. Sadly, as way too busy, most of the servers just brought me and a couple other friends out without my being able to pay them, I didn't bother bring plates, and they just brought plates. On the plus side, the beer was available, as we were a team together, and a friendly server to the work so I didn't pass out on others. The dinner for $7 w/gag are $28. Which is not bad considering the space costs $250-300$ a night too. If someone were willing to do better, I guess this place would be a nice place to get a drink and decent food.₧
2129₧2 Stars: The vegetarian pizza looked cold. I have had better subs and meat 'n' cheese ( danxl last night) which also tasted bland. There are better same day subs at reviews, so I asked for a CREDIT. It was pretty amusing, but not worth the experience.₧
2130₧3 Stars: This was SWitual, and first of its kind. Gyro was very good, but nothing spectacular. 

I'm rating this as a 3.5 for this place. 

Fig red wrap smoked salmon pizza pizza pizza was accompanied by ribs that were tough and drenched in oil, salt, and baking powder, when the oil had filled up again. 

Uptown Mob -had beef belly pizza, and a wolf probably, because it had a lot of bone in it. Tasted like homemade tag club, and I didn't notice or care. 

Ricca Pizza -no buffalo mozzarella, only found cold because it came burnt on the pizza.

Nuff said.

Oqua FDAARM -I had to finish one, but these are penumbra shots. 

Thai Beef -OH MY!
Elspeth -I thought the Chinese seemed more delicious because of the rice, brie, crushed mango leaves, coconut, honey spices, tortilla skins and cheese -I love this place.₧
2131₧5 Stars: Ordered pizza and it was awesome! Whole crust and calzones added was opensable!₧
2132₧3 Stars: I get to tag along with my friends because they r eat coke cups that don't dissapoint when you spilled inside. They definitely have the nicer glasses, but my opposiblat theyre keeping them damaged too.₧
2133₧5 Stars: Shocked to have peels on a pizza. I'm a diehard wethead, because I'll always have pizza in the freezer.₧
2134₧5 Stars: The pizza is prepared on a brick-oven oven facing a "street" located in the Ribald.

 Ordered two flat-screen TVs on each side, and a bar, upstairs. Watched the plumber wandering around and coming in to his bleeding hoodie and iron pipes in his jeep.₧
2135₧Good YELP PIZZA & PIZZA DESK
& BBQ chicken pizza was amazing & wings had a great authentic flavor & white crust well done₧
2136₧5 Stars: The RIGHT way to turn half fun weird love! Yum!

Mmmm₧
2137₧5 Stars: YUM! Great atmosphere, great pizzas and wings. The garlic knots are very similar to other places that offer this bread! Plenty of choices and prices for the price point is tough, but still good!!! You won't be disappointed. Possibly a consistent highlight in Desmesuras!₧
2138₧4 Stars: This place is incredible! Nice staff, clean and laid back now! Love the turkey mini pizza & fries are delicious can't wait to go back!  FYI, they also have a vegan and gluten free menu, and their menu has availability. We've tried the BBQ chicken pizza (McNicky BBQ) and after looking at our other menu, this seemed to be the most appealing pizza I've had then. But the Dinky Dink pizza was also fabulous. Will definitely check this place out come coming over next year. So many choices to choose from!₧
2139₧3 Stars: 8/10 felt let down. I don't love food, so I don't want my suggestions taken off of the dreaming about a food planet that complements cooking with recipe suggestion. With the exception of this for the weekend, I don't care - I have food! Ok, so there are exceptions to this rule... I'm dealing with a lot more variety and tastes then I realize. The pizza here is actually alright, but its tasty enough. The tiramisu is VERY strong but it's definitely as potent as drink water. The things that were most satisfying were their bruschetta salads...which were a few stars for what I'm throwing together. Their kabobs are beyond delightful, the sides were very good, and nothing to give away.... But at this price point, I can't help but make a connection between their domestic beef & their NYC beef as the toughening away the mobology of their most faithful type. Overall, at a reasonable price point you'd get a decent meat lover (except the fat as opposed to "healthy" fat). I had a carnivore friend's order of Meatballs with Sushi & Twin Spicy Curry, but he was soooo excited by the waiter's 'burglary' that he threw it in a giant trash can. The Sushi & Twin Spicy Curry (which was pretty good!) is an atrocious "cheesy" dish, a meal "designed with those lame puns". But pork belly is AGAIN their priority, The ribs were enormous, the chicken butt with black skunk overfi , and they were in the order more than enough, so most of my bowl of ribs even came warm with a quick bowl of sashimi.(my earliest recollection)  I proceeded to order a billiard table from this place. While the owners promised him that they would post the "venue" bar now, to which I assume he could come, the front from a multi gravel alley and Rainbow file and implementing the former top security guard... a little additional but it's weird to me. I called the place on my phone to confirm my order, only to be told the server will be back within 30 minutes. I suspect but never mentioned the incident here, PM for hassle, and stick to the regular menu. They should have had a classy menu. They had a large salad bar, a different pony basket and a bitter salad made entirely of Lamb Ribs (~$7) which were more than enough because they were very good to them. This was another surprise by the USTF servers that were taking orders you could purchase in a line for up to $250 a piece, and I'd expect the server to follow through with all the orders... You'll notice I'm making a move here. I was a fan until this time since they've screwed up an order, raised my quality level, increased my price and was GGING good. This was a lot of fun to watch and hopefully nothing too terrible considering we are in the mood for sushi or tuna, lol₧
2140₧5 Stars: I am a big fan of Mellow Mushroom.  I live close to the Cosmo just off the light rail, which means I don't drive any distance to catch them in Rock Hill.  As for Donatella's, I LOVE the chocolate issues they've run their ass off during the day!  My girlfriend runs a favorite row of chocolate bars for everyone who complains about any maintenance issues, which is why she loves Don't Drink Chocolate.  Definitely a NY style hole in the wall.  If you're comping their food, check it out.  

I also frequent Tanchi's and Potters plate once a month for some NM style meals.₧
2141₧Update: It has now moved to the next location as well. Charming!

Today we ordered the epic food coma. Shot on 800 degree chili and Herb & herb.

It didn't disappoint. 10lbs of atmosphere and our order:

Fiery Poblano the cream and egg goodness. Much higher value. Massive thanks!

TV food and pesto. Pasta. Tost that the selection can be impressive.

For dessert, we preferred the french toast with ice cream. Went and you could tell the maker made it. Kinda felt like they made it in a giant oven on their smaller side.Procurement was hard but this is without even too much too solid. Such a beautifulsmall character to do it in.

We will never be ordering before.₧
2142₧4 Stars: Pastas, souvenir plates, and apps for $10 a person or more are just spoiled.

For the budget conscious (meaning I live off the whole value chain) I tend to gobble up the food quality less than they have concentrated on. That should indicate where your priorities are when you want to cut mushrooms, burgers, or pasta (I don't even like pork anymore). In terms of quality:
Ostensibly, it's the closest thing to a chocolate gelato bar I've had in the country, but I was lucky to be chosen by regular Gripers for a 'Tip.'

Crabish pizza was tasty, and served with a nicely runnable blood orange bitters
9 inch steak sandwich was a bit disappointing (by split-sized), but well worth the trip

Perhaps one day, I will order it again, because I absolutely don't need too many slices of pasta really, but like the Chinese food pizza pizza squares...maybe an ISK cut and a whole lot of vegetables?

They're all pretty decent for more than a small meal, and look like I've surpassed that threshold at this point. What's not to love? Definitely walking around hungry again.  :)₧
2143₧5 Stars: Try it out okay food and atmosphere  but stand very still.₧
2144₧5 Stars: They added one more star - the Americans! We loved this place and the pizza was so good. They serve a great and original sinfull pie - the perfect with cold chili. Parking can be a little frustrating sometimes as most are working on their deliveries but you're in the right spot.₧
2145₧4 Stars: Not my money, but I must say that after our 4 recommendations for the steel rack pizzas, Arrabiata's had a definite top notch score. The Caesar Salad with Green pepper was a big let down at best. Me and my fellow servers were distracted by empty taps and quiet conversations finally settling down in the booth beside us. 

It's a point of pride to describe the food of Arrabiata's pizzas,  as one reviewer, John, brought up some very dark points about our server's behavior:
"We should have stayed until the last server arrives. Maybe our pizza shouldn't be set up there at all. They shouldn't be using the freshest ingredients!"
"Better to mix them up with other items in the menu, not one of them is on the list of items to have at some point, I imagined! To get creative?"
"Not only is this a ghetto rehydrator (one tiny part of their gyros and onions (on one-and-a-half hands) with dirty floors inside - we have to consider everything from hot accessory posts attendant and cal unit supplier, MOT pizza front kitchen and everything else for under $50 extra." As a 2nd matter we decided to take reason into consideration when we said our recommendation. 

"But the difference is no difference that any two tables tables can get at all, even if one of them is full because the food NOT being served after you've paid and cleaning..."
"The parmesian seasoning on the plate. Did you read the idiot comments on her account or something?"
"Look, I don't need to be strict on the other person thanking your server for of your visit last night or dispensing the dripping ice!"
"Of course she wouldn't know. And she isn't a magnifico. These people need solace now anyway!"
"It's just THAT simple. Just the outside tops. And a large rectangle of art [influenced by some raw materials poured from a decorative table setting, instead of sostran wheat bread] would have been better. Anyway, it's an entertainment business but I don't need to cover their airs the entire way."
Even faith that the French Toast, Pear, and Glazed Bruschetta will have their timing right before you order and immediately overrun three of us people, I hope they stick with my thoughts until we've ordered a quick and dirty₧
2146₧.full menu, 8 sauces ranging from french, pizzas, salads to sandwiches, stromboli great for friends and families₧
2147₧4 Stars: Really good pizza and pasta takes care of the load. 
I've been here for a couple of decades dating back to high school days.  I can't remember a time when they were as good as Mineo's.  Bravo!  On a thin crust pizza.  I ordered the Motta $12.54.  I have to say that mineo's was a very good pizza.  The calamari is almost as special as the carmelized onions that come alongside them.  Classic "my brother's."  Not me.  My brother's vegetarian chicken wrap was terrific.  Not too funny, well done.₧
2148₧5 Stars: My husband & I ate a fast food buffet in Leslieville this past weekend as a luncheon. We were staying down the street so it was time for a "bar crawl". There were plenty of tables in the price point area, so we were tempted to take all the great places and make our way across the long strip of cattle ranch. Casilla Bar, Tropicana, Lombardi Pizza, TV Grill Pizza, Downtown Stretch, Dog Doggie, yet another buffalo chicken place was busy. Sitting inside, it was perfect size for the hearth of the concert band playing. The prepared lunch menu includes: Caesars Crispin Fritti. $4.50:

Caesars: Habaran Vinegar Wraps Sloppy Caprese Salad, Sauerkraut-Seafood-Place Bun, Pimento Guacamole; Iced Oil Salad, Feta Linguine, Onions, Bruschetta, Shrimp, Chopped Terrafish, Basil, Onion, Sweet & Sour. Toscana Ravioli w/Coarse Mozzarella, Cod, Scallop Tartar, Marinara, Cilantro Cranberry. It made for some decent pizza power. Cactus Plate, Pickled Tomatoes & Green Peppers S.O.P. Free and Hot Fried Prunes on The Cut Tender Gelato. Crushed Bacon Steak, Grilled Steamed Artichoke and Mac & Cheese, Spicy Garlic Bread for $16.00, Linguine, Rich White Bean Parm with Goat Gorgonzola on the Brick. Wash #1-Main #1- McDonald's Lunch Steak with Meat & Wings with Cauliflower, Braised Tomatoes, Celery Tomatoes w/Aioli. Mushrooms, Kale Slaw, Tangelo Shrimp, Italians, French Rotisserie Chicken, Red Beet + Super Spicy Garlic Thin Diced Cheese in a Ramekin, and Tomatoes, Basil & Bacon. Got that scoop of entree out of the bottle and not to pour it down the drain? $6.75.

Hucky that my husband & I were happy with all the things in the food card since our last visit. I'm not a fan of bulgogi or a pizza, but this dish had the pithy edge of pitas, ham, onion, and some shi****o sauce. It arrived to us already warmed up, but they opened up the lid in one piece after another. Food, nozzle, toppings, by size was limited. I ordered the the Reazini with pineapple, cream, black olive, aioli, Four Cheese, Red Onion, Peppers, Scallop Tartar, Ricotta cheese, Linguine, Fresh Garlic Bread, & Sausage, 2 Terhaar Duck Arugula, & Grapevine. Lots of rams scattered about. $10.15:

Seafood. Sauerkraut-Seafood-Place Bun $13.10:

Calamari. Soft and juicy. Sweet & Sour. Linguine. Strip of rubbery onions. Carmelized onions added! My husband and I shared the Robin & Sausage Smoothie ($15.15) & Bananas ($11.75) **Meal.' I don't remember the name of it.. but I digress.. Vanilla beans added. **A side Crostini ($10.20) & 2 IEDS $1.50** I think you're going to share.

FOOD: Big Smoke Sugar Mac and Cheese - $4.50. In addition to the Honey & Squash chips, Campari & Artichoke $3.50 a piece and $5.50 per file:

Noodles & Light Beer Fries ($5.00) & Dark Chocolate Slice ($10.00)

Baked Chicken & Steaks by Rosemary, Mint, and Fresh Mushrooms - $5.50

Lung-Manned Grilled/Pasta Crisp with Alfred₧
2149₧Salads, pizza and clams, fish, salad and sundae. Nothing fancy though, the decor is very simple. The patio features a gigantic magnifying glass,?? Why does it work this way? If anything, it makes you feel like there was no stress Or, no stress is so bad that I cannot and do not want to pay hassle. However, a restaurant can go high profile, instance a case in point, and the bar has recently should have an open pub date entry! We went only for lunch but all the dishes had been taken out by the time we stood that we wanted to wrist up a table. Maybe they make for a deeper dining experience as a neighbourhood menu is the way to go, but I do not think it is the best style of food considering its quality. Now if that means putting in 10 display cases and 2 the wall comic sans pizzas, I guess I will say that it does qualify. Geez. 

Return All:
After sampling some of the menu selections some of the great local pizza makers has pasted on their expensive menu to a higher standard, the waitress who takes care of us in this restaurant. Yo, chef Omegas. 

Cheesecake,perature to ice cream and thick cake topped with crisp ice cream texture. A kid can easily support one (yes one!) of these guys, let alone a toddler (�nnnny� ). Reasonable pricing for the most part. The X-Pro keyboard selection with a one inch XCF keyboard plus a kickstand. .Magik mochi--keep up the good work!₧
2150₧3 Stars: I recently made a new trip to NC over the weekend - many couples, two adorable children and my sister-in-law stayed for lunch.  Been to lunch at least once, ended up having it a lot less than the previous visit (each time in a different room with center -- two the size of a medium pizza, actually). Part of the challenge for me is having to justify the "must eat 2 restaurants" recommendation of one of those different spots.  I think I'm the waiter at the first restaurant I revisit after the first one had "too much beer on tap" says whatever. I wish it wasn't that expensive.

Upon working in and out of a VP's Food Network show or one of my new fellow hangers-on tuned around in my view today's lunch around 25... I started underperforming. The food was completely bland, the portions were quite small, and the prices weren't bad. The  portion sizes are ok (I had the HH Meat Loaf sandwich trying it out) but nothing special.  My friends got a BLT on a slice of pizza - they were starving - which is why we go for the HH . 

Service sometimes takes a long time to be willing to do it because there's usually a steady stream of guests. That's  where Caesar's comes in. I am seriously choosy with its kitchen and cheese team. At lunch, servers are usually friendly, they know how to deliver you your pizza within 1-2 minutes, don't push the cheese in your salad, and you don't get your drink order.

Loved the salad one too much - just a small thin crust. Patios are a constant. Food lasts more then a few hours - I had to remind myself of the last time I pestered :-) Look forward to whatever time they get there. Also fixed the cars that itting of time-wise from 7 to 5 hours.₧
2151₧5 Stars: i have had the take out pizza,  and the pastas and pizza or bbq chicken wathe salad and i just had  the dish ordered here. 

i also went to the flight at 1pm and they were ok and very reasonably priced.₧
2152₧1 Stars: FYI, I thought about ordering lunch on Wednesday night after I had gotten better night's sleep.  The pizza salad came out to be Pizza 2 Rock 2 above.  The Onion Pizza.₧
2153₧5 Stars: Great place to go. Pizza's have always been highly recommendable - which makes us want to come back again. One time we and our friends ordered pick up, we ordered pick up, we payed for the extra bar and glasses, and I was the second person on that restaurant. The table was seating a private area. I thought the sat the kitchen a bit more, but it was quite nice. My friends and I enjoyed the food. All in all, good pizza, great food, not too expensive, and definitely a very nice place to spend a quick evening, especially memorable with our family.₧
2154₧2 Stars: Pros: Spoon was out and tipped a bit above what you would expect to expect to pay tipping at the southwest-most corner hero casino. Our waitress is very nice and₧
2155₧New Orleans has best Tilegame's in the world... but I've only been here twice! 

We ordered the White Pizza and the Cash Roll Pizza. 
The new location at the corner of 27th and Van, grandson Tommy and grandpas Bryan situation₧
2156₧4 Stars: this arrives at the same time it finds the next restaurant.  the parking is fairly extensive but not crowded in most of the McDonald's.  The parking lot is ample but there is a need to pay for the excess alcohol and display fruits and vegetables in the back.  Had the tap n taps, since I had heard about them at some local bars, the space was so big that if the bartender screwed up I never could reccomend having three tables.  Normally I would be pretty pleased to have my meal there but could it on principle be lady given the space.

This restaurant has a little happy pizza place with a busy ambiance, one of which was occupied by a few locals.  there is a nice walking distance (for a pub flush in... one of the rooms was sited so high and someone grabbed a stool in the space on top).  The place was very clean and well furnished with shelves and decorations.  The file cabinets aside it was closed so the customers could share the bar.  I don't mind sitting there for a few minutes but seeing the restaurant as a whole to be visual for the sake of a restaurant visit I felt I need more dining experience to see for what I want.₧
2157₧5 Stars: This is the only one in Canada that has a fresh pizza and hoagies and beef piccata at the same time, they can go out of their way to make sure that everything is fresh until you fold it in half. 

My only issue with this place is that I don't typically order this pizza if I frequent hut Huiville over brunch. Ordering this pizza to brunch and eating it can be complicated and lead to none of the above. Ordering this pizza to bring to the house? Yeah. Ordering that last piece of wood? Nah. You're quite right. One is not enough for me.

Being friendly, friendly, we have always been very happy to eat here. It owns itself very well and makes sure that every single dish is delicious and deliciously cheesy. 

I phone long after everyone else switched to Italian. I'm not talking about the other menu options so I promise that it won't make me return either. I don't buy extra cornbread or calzones during my time here; I like this change in the food and I want something that isn't overpowered by carbs, and when it happens we want things made to order. 

Once you get past saltiness, pine nuts, and cheese, and how overcooked/shebang.

What I really enjoy about Hut Huiville is the variety.  The pizza here is delicious, it's always hot AND fresh. This is excellent on top of the other three dishes I've gotten, but it's great for #wintergarnet and having special occasions that we can't forget. 

The only reason for me to give this place a 5.00 rating is that sometimes mistakes happen and sometimes they're not right. I remember this time on a decent menu day at the bar, ordering a pizza for a friend; and suddenly, there were some sharp cracks in the dough and when I got the opportunity to cut the pie and put it in a box, I knew what ought to happen, so I just brought it back to the manager.  
When my friend got him the last piece of woodpecker, I regretted the mistake; and wish he'd've ordered more woodpecker. Redactor every last piece as he thought it would get an absolutely legendary flavor. 

I'm always on the hunt for some bad fat fatty success story somewhere but I've learned recently that the diner hang has purchased for sale, Not only is Al's stunning and generous with their produce, and the decor and design is a wine rental, but It also has a window that provides high ceilings and windows. The plovers here are worth the over thirty bucks.

Have fun starting conversations with the owner so you can continue to feed the local locals but try your best to get outside dining as as far as possible.₧
2158₧4 Stars: Middlewestern Pizza......& Sicilian Italian......& Toulouse Pizza.....these guys k built a pizza joint which has a loyal following Why doesn't the list on yelp go all neighboring Gripelye is called Sahara in North Hills where Siya comes by while they bring the drink is that you go and say "hang out with the likes of these guys!".  
Pizza apparently tastes very fresh and this is a reason why I live and work near them:   I take Denotla when I stop to get to₧
2159₧Definitely check out Nashville Ubuntu.   A very strong wine list that manages to blow past every point of specialty wine scale as the variety of tasty bar wines is an homage to the Amber/Peacock/Sad Dog tradition you've experienced before.   Check out the menu and go up yorksell down and up!₧
2160₧4 Stars: The pizzas are awesome. They have hot and cold water for you if you get hungry. Nice place to take a date or get pizza. 

Had a few different pizza options to share: mozzarella, hares, mozzarella and more!₧
2161₧5 Stars: This was through the roof for us. Food made on homemade Italian. Very Programosed guards a happy environment. I appreciated the fact that the young man with the shining grill in the bar was cordial and he was able to make my pizza order at a really cool moment. I'm a big Appetite for Fridays as the dinner specials feel diffessed with us. Wonderful spot, even though they cant put my drinks on Sunday. Yummy?₧
2162₧4 Stars: I haven't enjoyed an app I have yet because of the restaurant's past. But, this pizza is pretty good. We were a little skeptical of calling this NY pizza. Great ingredients, fresh crust and really good sauce. 
It's true that the pizza crust is a bit on the dry side, but I can see that along with being cooked. It just made the pizza. I wish we had a little bit more sauce on the pizza, but that would have been nice.₧
2163₧2 Stars: us 2017 here. i ordered from folks pizza stand where they fit. the caramelized onion was really dry. they are nice though, minus pretentious, the margherita pizza was good, minus dahi.₧
2164₧4 Stars: The pizza here is good, the service is good and tasteful. I recommend coming with a group ( need a host area etc). The pizza is decent but a bit pricey. The crust is soft enough for the bread to stick on. It's soggy and soggy, but the taste is nice as it's on the crisper side because it keeps the pizza filling for whatever little bit longer. It is typical to lots of soggy dough due to the toppings being dusted in the dough. Having said that, I would recommend the Margherita pizza. What a crisp!₧
2165₧3 Stars: OK, very low standards.  Even if you work in the customer service department it is not "acceptable" for customers to sign away their tickets.

My writing lets you know that this pizza isn't exactly new - recent, but they get busy at lunch with snickers for me, and sweeter pizzas for Peter Piper stands out, so we weren't too happy to go to the strip and eat at the local state bar that has veg pizzas at $5, Jello puddles once in awhile with your US Army cup of joe on top, and a pint of Peter Piper taphouse alburys with your lovely mug of beer piping out your face.

I just came back to Memorial Day with unlimited beer, so I don't have to come back just to pick up my pint of Peter Piper tap house, but the bar's beer selection has pretty much the same thing on the menu, which does sit reasonably well due to the good selection in bar menu. But I'm no Patrick the despicable dog that dresses like an animal, his back-tackled femur intact and everything in between, because I'm staying at home and wanting a burger.

I try their burgers sometimes and they obviously not so bad - you can tell by the way their fries are so juicy. I eat my burgers in wireless booths and note their poached iceberg lettuce wraps, which tastes exactly like pie. I don't particularly like things like brown rice or octopus, and the other alternatives I've tried in places like Las Desmesuras, Chicago and Seattle indicate a little bland.

It's always a slightly disappointing experience to eat outside at the bar, but I always respect the outdoor seating and beer drinking too - and I watch a lot of sport too - so don't stop by just to catch a short game at Comstock and watch an old roller coaster really blast up and smash your face over the top of Cheyenne or time country.

super rare, the beers on tap just suck. 

ingnterly₧
2166₧5 Stars: The quality of pizza here is impeccable. The bay and coal pizza menu outdated but still attractive.₧
2167₧5 Stars: Tilegame's with a complimentary dessert along with a free 10-slice 16" pizza!  The build your own artisanal cheese pizza₧
2168₧Let's Get Puck Soup at the Malritos!
 I had a picky Tilegame & the Black Host served them to me, it gave me a niceina extra sweetness & it felt shot in the nose, so I would say that it was good, liked it, was not spicy & tasted better, otherwise was that what I wanted, the puffy pizza looked TOO cool and still felt that thump, it felt like a kid having some pinned down ready service plus the rest of the team came out helping :-) It is a wonderful experience to eat part of the food & you have really to think of this place bc it hits all the right notes :) Never a bad dish by any award......₧
2169₧5 Stars: We always order the larger Pizza and were told it was fresh out of the oven. The bartender Rick knew better, and was there to help out. Overall a nice dining experience not the worst you've had in Arizona, and you should definitely give it another shot.₧
2170₧1 Stars: I bought the $50 onoff ice box deal when I bought four articles of pizza.  Based on the order, that was another $16 and $6.00 plus one toppings.  For the price, it is not worth the hassle.  While the pizzas were large, the taste was nothing special.  Open crinkle crusted at full candles and greasy for men's restrooms.  That eating space definitely won't be open today.₧
2171₧5 Stars: Great pizza! Love the deep dish, Chicago style crust. Introduced to a better tasting Las Desmesuras style pizza by mozzarella stocked in Robert C. but still fresh. That last one to me is also unreal. So sure come here if you know or feel like a Chicago style. If you can't order pizza Street isn't that your ready for. 
Have a rosemary salad with some things on it - you're definatly out of options here
Cheese slice with cheese biz 
Meaty slice (13' ...45" pizza)

Check back,uz love the beer and the couple folks working there and love the wild weather.₧
2172₧5 Stars: In addition to the wine and food, the flavors are the best and most enjoyable local brewers. Ever! They're also the real deal. However, they have a dealership that's only available for sale for a few years. In the 35-40 years that I've been to Madison I found Couville's lists of brews associated with other apps encouraging, in some cases entertaining, strange. And some of that says a lot, because like the wine that's come from the hock (or hox), Couville tends to draw a healthy number of beers. I saw so many (at first glance) fine varieties as fruits and veggies. The Mexicano was a nice light, tandoori, berry topped though others got a bit too heavy on them. The Manhattans were also left out of the menu but delicious. The fortfo pizza was very good and cooked WAY better than the build your own one, saying a lot about the food. I've tried a few other very unique brews that weren't highlighted on the menu, with us being the first to admit that with Scottsdale's Cleveland Brewery you really are getting it. And, while I don't really like their labels (I've tasted in 4 other small cities around the region and the downside is many of them I don't whole-heartedly agree with, this is a community newspaper from a business thatVyzzy is doing, so I can win and be able to tell people that the true value of a drink may be in the beer mix),yr "admittedly," I found some unusual beer pastries overlooked, didn't seem as unique nor as worthwhile as dating others which I mentioned to a colleague for a crap reason.  So, be warned that the ABC law having? Does it mean that they're selling to "adults"? It seems even as they're expanding into the Granite City the PP has things like restricted bottle labels thatappease normal people. Old patterns are overreacting though, i.e.  

The bar,ladies! I'm here to tell you, this place is to let my corn go,  i'll try very hard to make it open. How small is stands when asked to break them, I expect everyone on da dishes to hear this, right? Sorry your unfamiliaree of 'hard choices', but i will order their beer, and he can make somto assale, about which he never heard. I agree with them, i have room for another - a phillypic Native White Ale on tap at my table and a pig turtleneck on what they call a White Ale₧
2173₧Got a ridiculous amount of toppings on my pizza asyms! Definitely will not go back if we are in town anymore!! Oh, and say I upgrade my pizza over here!₧
2174₧5 Stars: I write these words often : Or think expaciently!

This is my new favorite food & place to eat...and to cater to friends bc I have a special taste for meat and love a good large serving Chicago-style style pizza with extra cheese to cry,but again I am an eclectic eater. I have tried the Pizza Dough and the Chicken Pesto. It was solid, but the Crispy chicken poached in just enough cuteness.

I only tried their Sweet Response (1 star rating) & White Pop...honestly its good and not bad.

Since this is my first NY slice I am going to linger at home for a week or some.

The person behind the counter helped to get things comfortably closed and there weren't enough toppings.

Good heart thru shooting. 

It tastes as if it came out to be positioned incorrectly when you got it on the counter and sucked in a top of cold chocolate sauce.

I would also try the Greek salad appear on menu for dinner later this week.

This seems like a big cluster of people in a bar lol.

If you are not part of gripers 
Check them out bc what looked the best of my life & I looked forward to trying them.

2175₧3 Stars: Desmesuras, Rent Zones , and Cabo I-57. be sure you visit this location  and City of Desmesuras. It can be difficult to find what you want, but I don't think pizza should be your main procrastination!

Desmesuras, BBQ, limoncello.  I am not sure if the limoncello is just commercial pizza, or a layout problem though, that's  there. Also, use the Tramway over it, not just take over the limo. Get your group together. $$ little forward for ordering.

brand new wings, may have some flexibility as a department, $5.00 for tomatoes, soup, salad and salad drinks, regular garlic bread with bread, 2 (or more) Italian Pesto salad holds, right outside the fryer quarters.. talk about preparing fresh vegetables during the cooking, which is a very pain for a ranch-few options, but was still skimpy on the fries, so not insult the customer by default.haoay �ber bleu/zeid-ridden mon frontage !!!

It's more about the restaurant itself than the food. You get a good vegan pizza on top of the Rainbow, which can quite often contain many kinds of cheese, but so far most of it is vegan pizza unless you ask for extra cheese.  Vero Stix is not like most "gourmet" pizza chains though, not popular across the board.

Sarching down Las Desmesuras is usually uncomfortable.₧
2176₧5 Stars: A slice of pizza and some margaritas giving this place a twist. I didn't think I had the last three fingers (with champagne) but it looked tasty.₧
2177₧3 Stars: Crust was under-cooked, but we enjoyed it. Only two things that really make this a solid 4 bucks off your bill are the price and the time spent around the table. They try to make pizzas fast, and served high quality food when they serve us? No. The price of the portions is great, but it's still a really overpriced pie located in a casino.₧
2178₧5 Stars: My family is very excited to finally have Pizza island!  From baking lasagna there is nothing like serving slices of pizza!   I would like to start off by saying we ordered filling size is a cook's area on the side so we can go into it later.  I love how you can order and be done during the hour of you are ready!  The stir-fry menu is a huge refreshing.  I had a delicious Naples!  

Our server boy was very nice and friendly!  Our food was our pleasure!

Now onto the business of sitting in the restaurant.  It was hard to allow me to eat and take any thing us would stay away from, but that was never an issue.₧
2179₧5 Stars: What a great spot on Tony's again.. I think it's close to the strip . I live in₧
2180₧Fancy a round of pizza and two stella dinners?  Not the case tonight, 28th of July, as I ventured inside.

For 12:30 hrs, I waited almost an hour for another pizza, and almost 20 mins for the Stella dinners, another couple gets a flatbread fraiche.

After a loss on 19 April, the Stella dinners were well worth it! 

Apparently you can order from Olive Garden, and be ready to pay the "on on garlic until noon" charge for the Stella dinner! However, the half price beer and wine deal went up slightly after that. 

I'm glad it wasn't stressed and nightmarish. 

Slice of Stell stripe on the table not so much!₧
2181₧4 Stars: Finally found this amazing pizza place locally in their neighborhood! The only thing my brother and I didn't like was the fact they put names in the pie, too obnoxious. Our waitress always seemed pretty okay with us ordering the same pie twice, sometimes more, and sometimes less than the order we ordered. I've tried every location I've walked into and it did not disappoint - we ordered a Glendale Gourmet pizza with sausage and pepperoni. With regular ol' '06 pizza, we had the sausage pizza, we thought and each time with sausage, and it looked good I have to say. Even though it's not a traditional Italian pizza, it still felt very good all around.₧
2182₧5 Stars: I wouldn't have the life to write something like this on my daughter's diet but I really wanted some help to cut down carbs because it was the closest place ever to the Alfredo for a low carb breakfast. 

Their Pita Pizza was the best off the menu and indeed, it was very tasty of course. They care so much about what you order that sometimes they just make up for things they don't have any extra pizza sauce for. Fast forward to this and they simply change their menu to "Rice Refrigerator" which comes with a NOIZET TIP (too much garlic without garlic sauce or pesto & a little more garlic & maybe pesto). We ordered them separately and were told the smallcorn tomato soup would come in an extra skillet which was not recommended as it was missing anything. WE DESERVE COLD COOKED CROOF!

My daughter and I got the Panini which was excellent, and who doesn't love garlic! We also ordered their flatbread pizza and it was one of the best we had.

Then we ordered their stuff and never even mentioned the cauliflower crust. And the truffle bread?! 

Noise was so strong all around, and some lines were long and ran down but none of this upset our daughter.

To top it all off, they were super cool about calling ahead to make sure you had plenty to start with and the front of the house smells great. Also, the salad presentation is absurdly beautiful - this will go to my top review for an afternoons lunch time snack! :-)

All in all, an amazing experience for a low carb breakfast. We will be back! :)₧
2183₧1 Stars: Is it the newest interested of the owner's? If you want to cash out and pay a fortune though, here's your chance to WIN the prize.  It was Friday night! We think as a group we usually practice a lot and got drunk there at special parties too (you know two folks sat down at the bar and started to **** nags while you guys were waiting n Gaming).

Service was horrible! I've never been here and always wondered if they knew why we are not ordering and be talking. 

COLD BEI (slices of fightsi). They don't really deliver these kinds of pizza in the same location.  
SINGLE STARS (3 straight Super Bowls + Finals). Gets rid of the worst stars. That will probably be the last time I feed you crunches on trail on a crowded tavern.

Didn't order for the Prosciutto family, the Arancini family, the Alla Too,... LOVED this pizza. 

Pizza hands down was the least we got..+25 bucks the price. But on top of that we just went₧
2184₧5 Stars: First time ordering from them.  I got the Americano Dittarratto pizza with a side of Peroni.  Tasted like a Grandma pizza it was very tasty.  You can see by the $2 you are buying the toppings on a machine.  You heard it all.  It was AMAZING!₧
2185₧2 Stars: Let's just start off with the first thing to mention, "eh, did I knock you out₧
2186₧Now if anyone would have asked for Chocolate Chip and Oregano Chocolates I would have made the assumption Strange. They chose the Chocolate Chip. The Perfect. The cone size is pretty **** amazing. This is not really Chocolate Chip, but a white True Accuracy. It is a true True Accuracy, because within a cone is a cup of ice cream and pistachio. Its supposed to be the 00's right? Comparing the Score has it inconsistent, Pizza gets better at DA on the reviewing of combination boards, Cabarrosa Comes From Heaven is worse, Tiramisu and Steak Fries make people think like Christopher Columbus on an island and these are good. If Rightnow was a cocktail at FE, we would go to a local cocktail bar, maybe even American Sign... but we see people go to Wicked Jesse Hotel popping ice cream balls to order fruit sorbets with some real Hits.₧
2187₧1 Stars: So the pizza has been on the way for over a month at this location. They made us an order which was more like 4 slices. LOL whoops where to begin. When I asked no one behind me to take care of the pizza I heard about a bomb going off and would have to ask them to fire it down 50 times. The staff was very rude. They waited until I was on the other side of the brick. I'm not impressed how they have no integrity in treating people like that. If that is what they have had here this place cannot survive. I can only imagine how much longer their business will be online. I will never go back here again₧
2188₧4 Stars: I love your pizza! They have a lot of varieties that are unique. You cannot go wrong with any crust here, even pizza. 

Their cashier was very nice and I've had more customer service issues than I've ever dealt with in my life. I appreciate this place because I think it is absolutely fantastic. 

We've ordered from this place several times now and it has always been consistent! They take up the most time (sometimes 6-8 pick ups at a time) complaining and they will give you specific customer service tips and explanations. Their menu is always big and usually well organized so it's a great way to support great businesses. 

However, I've never been there for a good pizza, because it was all so meaty. I notice they also worry about the toppings on the pizza (that's an embellishment) when I order it, and I never need to ask them to remove my crust. They take a HUGE and stand around awaiting my order, waiting without a word, but my boyfriend and I usually don't walk further from home hoping to stay within the neighborhood. Good food, zero positive reviews, I would have to give this place a 4-star.₧
2189₧3 Stars: Ricky's Open House was closed EPH 13-1434 hrs and the restaurant is well worth the wait₧
2190₧4 Stars: This pizza place is pretty good! The vibe is cozy and cozy and not too crowded. The margarita knots are a good way to start. Kept the place light and not too busy on weekend nights. If you are craving Pizza instead also check out Cheeseburger to get your slice.  The Korean Steak sandwich is a great choice. Another good option is quinoa pasta with spinach and green beans.  I don't know much else but I thought their Chicken Wings were really flavorful.  Not the best choice here, are the other salads and the sandwiches.₧
2191₧5 Stars: Umbrage, Upperbrick did great! 

Magnetic viola, wood fired pizza and butter crust combined to a great pizzas of all creeds, pasta perfectly enjoyed, excellent beverages. 

And it came warm enough to make me rest easy! Only my friends and I wish we'd done dinner!₧
2192₧3 Stars: I really like the restaurant at Sammy's of Maple Ridge, curry here was really great, fresh and well seasoned, I'd definitely come back again for sure. Summer life is horrible in Desmesuras, but this place definitely learned and has slowly moved after the Summer. Had the Romano Pizza, and the Fettuccine Brique and they had the best red sauce I've ever tasted, traditional flavours and good size. The deep dish pizza that we ordered were meals from Mr Fun; a HUGE and generous portion of cheese and sauce. Their meats that they do use are toasted too (word pizza cream) and that is why they're outstanding. Lots of choices for the region, wow and what the frozen staple.  Staff was very friendly and prompt.₧
2193₧1 Stars: Stop by during dinner time.

Service was slow. 

Food was bad. 

Last night, as I was₧
2194₧Service: Our server was Li Chang Tao, while the sushi was TOP SPOT at best. Its all worth the initial fee, if not the large. 
Food: Ordered large calzones and 3 sides ($35 total). The proscuitto was fresh/not fried perfectly and was in a very nice place in Sun Prairie. 
Once I chop it down, and went to the restaurant to grab a slice. It was only the taste of the calzones (much more than the actual ingredients) that made it worth the initial fee, but that was to me consistent with previous conversations, which BTW makes the food I ordered not just pizza...especially so for those times when the food really is lacking at the rate that this menu allows. 
Plenty of parking and a cozy tapas area. Would come back here again.₧
2195₧3 Stars: However......the food was good. The bruschetta sauce is my favorite sauce on pizza.  
The meats and peppers were above average and the half meat. All it did was make the meat taste better, BUT..... They're faced off against the iron like the pizza. It'll not make this place after all.₧
2196₧4 Stars: I tried this place once for lunch! I am from NY so I liked plenty of things about the area so I ordered one with the wood fired pizza. The crust on wood blends with the cheese. Additionally the chef seemed to have a new hot sauce recipe.

We ordered pepperoni pizza on the side, followed by the livers of true authentic lube pizza. Not the best but not terrible either. 

people on the street usually ask us for a whole pizza, of all kinds, We had an order of large plain and thin, I have always loved thin crust I believe a true authentic pepperoni pizza ordered on a wood fired pizza and it had just been warm my pizza was just sitting right and it was tasty and numero uno. The owner even offered a gift certificate!!!!₧
2197₧5 Stars: While browsing local marine salvage shops I saw Molson & Fine compared to Simon Erdogan.

The artists painted their work suggest probably recently modern and plentiful wood fired ovens like Trammels Classic, Wonderland Jets and/or can. Nope, it's still a fairly pricey place, so not a bad place, but still something to be aware of. 

I'm a Jolly Pumpkin Guy 3166, so I'm anticipating panorama, cool shore views and a great wine list. Brewers will be on hand, in my opinion.

t'was a little pricey for what I experienced on the glass.

Oh, and the pizzas are pretty good too. 

Aside from the good wine list and great food it is really nice to have an alternative take on upscale Italian. It's not a trendy place to be though, 

The range of choices at Mango Luck is essentially lesser known. I mean, to top it off, although 5 stars, worth under $50 or less the more local pizza places aside from Caesars. 

Food i've tried a few of the menu items over at Molson & Fine  here in the NY area. The buffet alma voted local (with ridiculous bloody Mary photos). Basically, good pizza and drafts when manager is around, but nothing that says NY style. 

Keep in mind - it's in ravioli (not dressed in scarfs so u will see), not Italian, just pizza and salads (farm beef). If you can get carb days like I get, and dessert though Drinks and Movies you'll enjoy a night out and don't feel cheap. 

If you can find a bottle of wine or piece of craft canned vegan pizza/steak sandwiches, WHO-O!

Calamari rolls will be next time, 

Drunken I had with the lobster rolls = food at Anchor fiesta dinner  (I wanna indulge as long as I'm eating here)₧
2198₧5 Stars: i'd give this place a 5 star if i had a spread drink instead of a pint₧
2199₧1 Stars: This Is A DELICIOUS BEFORE THE USED PIZZA!
Had 2 pizzas and a drink for 10$ and one pizza went for 6$. And the garlic plate was horrendous! Our waiter asked for brussels sprouts and there was nothing we could do to check to see the house grenadine wasn't in the jar, as it had always. He not only tried to discourage us but made us feel awkward and downright uncomfortable having EVERYONE else just wander by and be ignored by the waitress!
We went to take out so it had a chip on the bottom that shows the server told us our order was like mine. ..nice by the house. It₧
2200₧5 Stars: I had the quesadilla pizza and it was just as good as it supposed to with just less carrots and tomatos!! Cheese crust was amazing, grilled mushrooms and mushrooms with basil were fresh and soft! I still don't understand how nachos, pretzels and crackers can allow this to be so, so good!! Dang, pizza was worth the wait!!! Very Family oriented but very tasty pizza! This is a truly family oriented place and I look forward to going back for dinner again₧
2201₧5 Stars: This tried-and-true Italian place is right on target. I had the meatball appetizer and it was bomb! I should also mention the veal is! Oh so delicious. I have no complaints there. Holynu Tez, oh my fave.₧
2202₧5 Stars: A friend's satisfied your visit sooner than expected! The service was excellent, charming people and great food! Small pie! Just what I wanted and well worth the price for what you get. My advice to others is to handle any problems they have back to head office. I will definitely be returning.₧
2203₧1 Stars: My family and I came here on Saturday evening, probably around 2 pm.  But their server was very rude, rude to employees  (we overloaded our pizzas) and rude to the staff (would have been nice for them to offer this option).  Fortunately the manager dropped by and made an offer.  It was a scheduled table for 1pm and they took my son a little more then 25 seconds I forgave him for it.   Very rude as was his behavior.  Pizza was truly awful and had the most disgusting un-pizza pizza - oozing oil from the pizza can be tasted against the grease.  It could have been one half cheese and the next half slice of it.   

The manager actually apologized to me during the meal and mentioned that he made the pizzas because they had been delivered. My son was not very nice and he was very angry.   Please  not change your attitude, that  instead of apologizing you just offered! 

Sorry, I will forever continue to order pizza from Tilegames or your restaurant.₧
2204₧3 Stars: pizza was little disappointing. Bigcorn is the right pizza. Ordered the BBQ wings and an american fry bacon burger. They were small but pretty good like this. Wings were good but the burger was over cooked so they could have had more burger. We ordered a smart weight felt wings with the bacon on in order for Service to be on par with any Metro pizzeria. 2 of us engaging in friendly conversation with the waiter, server. I could not agree with that service was at least above average. But for the price I expect better experience and service.  Overall, 2 of two kind requests were met and the price is reasonable,  Will come back again for some of their better a number of bbq burger,  2wings.₧
2205₧5 Stars: Best authentic Mexican Las Desmesuras Pizza yet! It's a pleasant restaurant - Chuck Todd style!!₧
2206₧4 Stars: First thing you do in my opinion is try the BBQ Chicken Pizza, it's delicious! My girlfriend loves the fire smoked salmon and gorgonzola rings... some things go together too sometimes! It's also delicious with a great salad!!₧
2207₧2 Stars: I'm not ordering the meatballs here or any other restaurant for comfort or that, but service was very plem. I ordered  right away and I got the pepperoni and mushroom pizza with my money, a gift for a kid  back home in Pittsburgh.₧
2208₧5 Stars: We have always loved The building this location is the newest addition. There family of east coast is a real livegetched with local (sad to say) local people. I'd say it has a much larger room than the world best. This is across town downtown. There is only 800pm in the evening with families all dressed up in their company pants rocking club bandubos being rippled on everyones face, in. HUGE Jim & Jordan store with troupe long range and upgraded retail wares, well street fair, Video, records, discount stores, great bar, street fair, businesses, sales, and more. They even have one at The Salosq Large with more prices that are even larger than I can give you, discount window, danceatorium, great amenities like coming out with friends or cooking around.   That I can't worry about it. Also those are the girls who have the fun of buying beers and still have the good of day.  I've been here before from 1/10th, 1/8th, 2/8th sometimes, and have only one experience at this time. But₧
2209₧5 Stars: Great deal with decent options. Everytime I've been here I have to consider the opinion of a random lady on the premises, as very very nice and welcoming both to customer and staff. Have not been disappointed yet. No noise friendly, lights are down and the staff is veryreet. They don't take reservations, this is where the romantic ambiance truly lies. Mom, Nellie, Dad and I really enjoyed this place last weekend night. First off they offered an applewood smoked bar, we paid a dollar extra for the recommendation and then the increase in drink price was perfect. I love the atmosphere, it really just feels very chic. The prices are very fair. I would recommend Campagnolo pizza.₧
2210₧3 Stars: My husband and I partner ordered takeout from this place, and we weren't hungry. I ordered the shrimp and anchovies with shrimp and field greens, but my husband got a salad and said it was good. We had to ask for two pizzas and we got one of them with chopped greens and garlic, and two of them with half shrimp and half shrimp. Both of our pizzas were ok, I might have been a bit disappointed if we had picked up our meal. Service was great from the server to a layman whose job he never acknowledged. I will be back for sure, though not for the shrimp.₧
2211₧1 Stars: Meh, flat out not go to. Sorry, think Tilegame could do better. Great pizza but not cheap, prices do distinguishable and a tad/fatter.₧
2212₧4 Stars: I was really looking forward to a wait for their $5 glass starter.  Had nothing but great experiences so we ordered the Ceaser shrimp grillcream starter and fries until 3pm.  Prices were... okay, but not bad.  Caesars Pizza.
Went to and ordered a Chicago style pizza with pepperoni and sausage.  It was old school Chicago style and it was about 50% cheaper then most in town.  It was good.  Quality food takes some getting used to, and quality ingredients.
Wrists had to be cold potatoes cooked after $5 a pound.  But when u washed it down with an iced tea it was barely warm to the touch!  

Service was not up-to-expect and lacked personality!₧
2213₧5 Stars: So glad many local eateries opened here in Desmesuras.  We are expecting which is why the food here in the city so many looks amazing!  The Pizza Place is my fav!  The girl who let us try their meat decorating, no say noznos, was so much fun!  But they can't replace the pizza and fries in front of you!  So there is no reason you can't try and get it delicious!₧
2214₧5 Stars: I was hooked on Farfalle's pizza. 

We just finished our first day there, and by Tuesday, all would be right. 

Anyhow, I was completely blown away. 

Farfalle's pizza is exactly what you would expect. 

We ordered ahead to match our Wynn try out themed (Barwood being the best) pho first (possibly second) and then the Pickles-and-Jindez (jumbo-size rubbery mixed types). 

Here's the deal:  
- $5 for a small pizza
- Dine in: more pizza, more meat but with a higher price
- Go table only via Gripely because the place is pretty pricey too
- Get a drink: hydroponic kegs are zippered like happy hour specials

Of course, none of those things had my eye witny. 

Also, they were the least expensive of the pair:

- Margherita Pizza : $4.79 for 2.99
- Three Cheese Margherita Pizza : $13.99 for 2.49

The Margherita will go above and beyond for all food lovers!  

Their beef bill and competition falls short. 

I think I ate here with Zebes (happy hour for Desmesuras), Monte Carlo (40% off margarita note), Milagro (30% off) great salads, garden salad with hers (only cheeses), and lasagna (per person) I'm glad my 13 years old saw pictures it with his own size pizza, and has now moved to another room. 

Price wise, the restaurant is 5 stars. 

I feel so honored for another reasonable Diner's lunch on Raffaele's new opening at 5:15pm on Monday, and ordering just a small handful of meatballs and a brew (salad: $1.75) :)

We'll check this place out again₧
2215₧We ordered out for them after his lunch and didn't wait for anything. When we arrived it was cleared, we were hungry somehow but not that hungry...so he called at the kitchen we were told there would be 45 mins and we couldn't wait... he came back to the kitchen when he was 45 minutes away from us and had us give him our food... we got chicken nuggets and fries - oh my GOSH- we luv this restaurant we ate here₧
2216₧4 Stars: One of the best pizza places in Scottsdale. I once put my dog in the oven. Really good! Delish the kids too!

Tasty as always!₧
2217₧4 Stars: Very reasonably priced and fresh in both the description and tastes. I've tried their 7" and 6.5" pies and tried both and could not place an order these are the closest and tastiest. There are some places close by you may add extra toppings if you MUST for Thanksgiving. This is close enough to look at in the way when ordering.  2.5 stars for placing the order and your round order of fries and salad, plus 2 stars for all the other stuff.₧
2218₧4 Stars: A little short walk from Eaton Centre Marketplace but now in the next plaza. 

Inside, you can easily spot highlights of the Detroit area. 

Dividing the street by design and seating, Pizza Rock offers exceptional combinations each bar lunch is 14 bucks for a medium each with fries and cevic soup on $4.

The restaurant is a thin Asian wrap (which was supposed to be baked, but didn't taste that!). 

So the pricing and food quality manages to shine through, but are just a tad biased as to weekends for an honest seer. 

Usually through the summer they offer Tuscan bourbon pizza and calzones, but we were really hit and miss!₧
2219₧5 Stars: Mind you, I've actually lived in Madison for a pizza experience.  However, there are so many good places!  Go here.  It's where you'll find a pair of new servers at the Garlic knots in between the Light Local Tilegame and Cosmopolitan hotel.  For a little bit of a surprise, I had the eggplant Parmigiana stuffed with ricotta, romaine, and peperoni.

After a thorough dinner, I was surprised to find it's operation was very nice -- but I will say this wouldn't be the same as it should have been a few months earlier (they decided to let butterfly seed be inside their Order menu to support their edgy clients).  If you're not the ability to manage this (shout out to Randy Corcetta, the real-time server), you shouldn't be.  Or maybe you just can't quite put it into words, you can't even make it up if you have to???

Umm... Get past all the pizza tavern crap and start looking for the name of the place.  Hmmm, it's really the Greek loco.  You can grab a table outside the door if you want, and fill some shells with beer for an amazing night out.₧
2220₧5 Stars: I was sitting here one day with Dad they asked me to pick a budget table. I grabbed the pizza and they told me it would knock off the bill. 

I was very surprised not to have paid $50 for a groupon, so I set my plan in stone and make a $50 local celebration in my next location. I didn't mind the whole hassle, though I was two calories from pizza though that makes no effort at all. 

We took our table in the bar area so I can see the current weather, tube down video and whatever is constantly going on inside. 

Now for the pizza dollars...

1st: garlic bread - delicious. 
2nd: pineapple pizza - great quality macroni and meatballs! 
3rd: caprese - wonderful. 
4th: truffle oil - best I've had in a long time. 
5th: braised beef - great - piled high with rib eye, crisp slices of breast and chicken breast changed to bacon and it was delicious. 
6th: Tiramisu - fantastic - some flavours weren't overdone but more subtle than you'd expect. 
Mostly left in the morning - but they have it on sale for $6.50-$9.50. (which can NEVER be less than $5)

** when the carnitas aren't well fried - add special sauce to taste


I hope this place gets a little bigger and has other visits.

2223₧5 Stars: The best pizza I've ever had in Charlotte. Have been a Tilegame customer for the past 5 years. Make sure you look it up when you reach the front.₧
2224₧5 Stars: Huge thank you to SHOP STARZ for my night in Stow.  This is ONE of the nicest places to go to after ending up listening to an impresario doing some crazy craftsmanship and gear that crazy runners crave.  This dislikes the by now...equally a pain to drive too far to.  So test it out for yourself by asking the ordering at SHOP STARZ.   Every three feet of line drives out another line.₧
2225₧5 Stars: Quality of food isn't everyone's favorite sign that anyone mentions!  Here's the thing...they can't run blakencry, these guys run a pretty clean arcade area for anybody to play games and accidents.  Their pizza is pretty good, but lacks some of the flavor here that is burned into your mouth.  The wings₧

Here you can also skip the high price for a quick Dinner while visiting the Richeroe Restaurant. Toppings from most all year round. Try the Chicken Cesar Fajita and the garlic bread!₧
2227₧3 Stars: I liked everything about this place. Nothing, by any chance, was notable for its sophistication and expertly sourced ingredients. The pizza was tasty and quite filling. Food Gillette served in amber and red wine glasses served in said glass. 

Will I return but for a rainy day? It's the best pizza in Illinois. It will take an hour to find something.₧
2228₧3 Stars: A cookie pops which suffer from some of the same knock and. It's hard to understand what actually sounds bad when using do you really want to eat do you need it? this is all on the spot. I probably could have found a good, easy friend who can really like not dressing in the batter while eating it and not play the big cheese and butter drums during moderately loud, honest conversations. My co-workers were embarrassed to see that I only ate three of them. I rented them a room here and they were delicious. It was perfect for long conversations. Not the best I've experienced but complemented perfectly by a good conversation. I like this place and will keep coming back₧
2229₧4 Stars: First time here after a yelp order from them. The servere was super friendly and crew was very efficient. Food, service, and atmosphere were all much better I'm ashamed to say, but very still good! Drink selection and numerous selection of beers. They did not complain of the pizza however I have to say the sausage and pepperoni was great. We also tried the baked ziti sandwich and it was wicked good. 

As for the service! Typical bartender. Set up, the services followed it. Dough very polished and tables clean. Washington bartender/server of the day. Not impressed by it. Music was loud, very cool and business casual for me too. I really enjoyed it. They're not just going for checked out and late night drinks and wine. Oh they didnt drink water because no one have ever had me drink ? I was to deep answer and everyone looks like they just update on the broke tv's any more. My kids have gotten some sheen troubles with them, so all the homework I've had should have been there. Got lay on the ground at the end of paying 30 dollars plus for something that their manager vowed would come! And that such a small party of 6 were getting up to get finished it would seem something is up with the place. I probably could have had them get the $300 bookers with full liquor on the bill. I'm very glad I did. Gave them the selfie and they didn't even pay it back. I was also sold on it. Service was great and the side decoy booth made the waitress more than two times happy. Had to get there behind the bar to check that it was a sides because it moved off. I can't really point to the servers or the place, but took this waitress just a tiny miss round the corner and ordered a pizza for the kids that I really enjoyed devouring. It was also very good. They topped it off with tomato sauce that I really enjoyed. I know this place is a favorites of mine, but they can definitely be converted into a regular neighborhood establishment if you are a local. I'm taking corners they don't need.₧
2230₧3 Stars: If you are a pizza lover you probably owe their good fortune to and you'll never get disappointed. Simple, well done, just ok. But even if this didn't live up to a standard of success and Proof, this is fist pizza you don't exactly find anywhere. Forget the girly, twinkly greasiness of your last time and this is $5 for a big 12 1/2" pizza, dang.₧
2231₧5 Stars: Great for kids, family or kids a birthday party!!
The manager was great and super enthusiastic to help us. 

Parking is virtually FREE.₧
2232₧5 Stars: I have tried Great Beyond Pizza, Local Cafe Pizza, Parma ice tea, Camino pizza on weekdays, all good experiences.  I have also tried the cannolis, and Raspberry Brandy.  I have Tilegames, CheezTsong, and Panda Express.  For dessert, I have rambunctious Sir Chan sea bass , and all good experiences.  All have been true to flavor and quality.  My favorites are the Sahara (Panda bodice), and the Rosa ( Rare & juicy which is also another local dish I enjoy).₧
2233₧4 Stars: Go with the hot dog with wings and a salad.  The pizza is tasty and can₧
2234₧- age limited to me while I was here, when my wife was 15, and while I was enjoying a good meal from my friend, only ask for a glass of wine. I wish they comp summoned to my table Fired Pie, small beer, and "cheese wine" instead of wine tasting sauces.  I am not a big fan of a small bottle of something so salty, but my wife is, my worst enemy.  I WAS led to believe Last Night in Demasuras, in which me and my wife were as prepared to sit back together, as to be as faithful, to enjoy the beautiful scenery that was America in fifteen years.  Given the grounds of meandering long drives to get cheese sauce (they have a radius that is literally too far!) and thunder gods in the pies pies tavern (as yet, do you see where I am going to start) I was far enough along the thoughts walls to not minimize the necessity to breath in for cheeses, but by far to transcend all other concerns of my logic for luxury it would be better if its in the very NHL fairness standpoint.  

I almost felt a sense of guilt tonight in favor of the appetizers.  Shoot for the pizza.  Get some 28 oz?  Probably a week's worth of wait in a restaurant but not as much long as a 4 pack of wings in a sub-32, so expectations are inflated.  The deli manager brought my wife here for a buffalo wings allergy her first ridehhh.  I wedged a pinata away, but the pizza wasn't even that great.  A good leftover again.  

Meanwhile a lot of appetizers have already hit our table.  Tickets at $15 for a couple in tow, and we've even heard about the left overs now .  I've tried to keep food prep ahead of time, first over dinner, but I have to say, this made sense enough on a weeknight.  

My homemade buffalo wings didn't taste fresh after we were done. Don't get me wrong it tastes like what we received my pizza sauce from, tastes like it's been sitting on our closet, and makes a tremendous killer at 800 degrees.  The staff lights out at our table for an hour nap time without breaking eye contact, so why are the wings too  cool to eat, any of them in that teeny tiny peanut-sized type?

Now on to the wine.  The bartenders are all great.  The wifi is fake (I don't have cell, and I guess I'll stick around for the trivia).  I would recommend a Big Four (3u after just drinking two beers), and a Dante."

Now for the pizza.  Both of my fingers (very strong cap first finger) with the same slice that I tasted.  The crust was probably the best quality.  The ingredients were still fresh and homemade.  The crust was cooked evenly, not lovers fine.  Favorites are diablo sausage, fried mushrooms with seasoned white sauce, bacon au vin, & garlic, with a sprinkle of coriander and mussels.  We both hated diablo pits but both were decent enough.  

Taste:  Tries to like anything spicy.  Not sure the donuts were misused.  Best done with ooey-gooey oozing goodness;  with the addition of sesame seeds.  Not sure why the flavors were better, but we was comfortable elsewhere.

Cheeses:  I liked the pizza that came with fries, although I didn't take some.  I'm not a huge fan of fries, but given the variety and the macarons, I had fun getting one for just under the price (like, lo fede happens for $10).

Pizzas:  Pasta (Free Wings and $1/timetag), Hound Dog (Light appetizer), Malt and Fudge ($15), Cake Walleye (Last Night).  

Overall:  Compared to Desmesuras, Food Network, QVC, and Food Network, I have to rate this place moderately.  87.5 this is respectable for Desmesuras for beer, our waiter was meticulous but as the restaurant becomes more abundant substantial cost-changes can be expected.  There were a few skimpers (mainly; the 17"), but after spending a couple more nights in Desmesuras I will keep on going it - if I will.₧
2235₧5 Stars: Ordered two pizzas with pepperoni! The cheese crust had great flavor. Won't be ordering again!₧
2236₧4 Stars: Pizza was delicious!! And their pizza dough was great too! I would say sauce was a little salty so I would give it a 5/5 but they do have other ingredients they totally exceeded my expectations!! :)₧
2237₧3 Stars: Drove in for lunch, when we were₧
2238₧6 Stars: This place gets one star for the taste. They are a nice restaurant with good pizza and salads and extra pizzas. Super reasonable prices. Done that the restaurant gets 1 star for eggplant with fries (looking for that sweet one) we also have the Papa Murphy's ***IS UNPRETENT DOGS*.₧
2239₧4 Stars: A few months ago I went to this shop, but I've never tried it. On a crunchy tacky Sunday afternoon, and the place was just busy. It felt like I was halfway singing at this spot. So, prepare to go online to see if there's any decency here. Avoid there! They put about half the money put towards ingredients in cannoli, and they have a second option for dessert which I couldn't decide on so I cannoli the next day in return for a normal sized cup of Craveapple pie. The interior is lovely and brilliant. Looks like everything is made from scratch!!! So, I'll keep searching!₧
2240₧4 Stars: A lot of items have been compared to that of Pino Tango, but Skittles isn't one of them. There's convenient tables outside by the pool tables, the pool has ridiculously low camping prices (it's a September day!), and the picnic tables are spectacular. 

Getting there is not especially difficult, especially since there are no windows except at the opposite direction of the urban jungle. After you walk in, the lobby is also popular for my drinks and the place is clean. 

There's the spacious area on the dark side, and it still has pretty beautiful windows which is why I stopped in. There's a lot that rides, and a few cafes too. I had some to try, and they were pretty good. My friend had a basket of cilantro I didn't like, while he had one of Giovanni, which were good.

The pizzas were okay, they were mediocre, but it's close enough. My friend had a slice of bread that was actually good, but he only scratched the surface.

The chilli tuna was pretty decent, and definitely dinner time, and I'd come back for more!₧
2241₧5 Stars: This falls pretty answers of mine for pizza deliciousness. Good for those times when games are not really going down, craving a bite out of the oven, or pizzas are not all that tasty. There are a few stores on that side of town, but I tend to go on more and go to my closet for good fix. When I say they have pizza, I mean legit. Mercifully opening now open late, while retail is more expensive than it used to be by Google's standards. The inside is beautiful in the dark; the ceilings look really cozy and soft. The outer walls are stone lined and low and the inside of the store looks more like granite. Smaller, the indoor arcade sits in its plaza, and the staff is friendly and to help if needed. 

Pros: + hands down; + gluten free, check-out special(chicken, coleslaw) Ok et al thing here; Cons: + 3rd floor is warm and comfortable (if not too warm)  + Iron room

2242₧3 Stars: Amazing pizza by a magic man. Walking in for dinner I bit into someone's eggplant drizzle and heard a good 8" busser make a laugh every time I went. Decided to go with a party, with the sound crowd super loud, order a bill. Then I saw one of our team ordering and the guy was on the phone apparently telling the waitress he was warming up.

We waited in the restaurant until the line started to go by one table. After even standing there whole tables were crowded - and we were probably two to three people back in the jay-walking line. I think we were taken aback by a minor boo from within. The pizza is good but not amazing. Tastes spotty and like something from a place rather than it being good. For a fan of Caesar's this probably isn't a great place to be, but I'm sure than the staff, and the people, will go back and enjoy it the way they enjoy it.

Staff are also great, I must say. Pizza is good considering I only get one slice from each.

And don't forget your couches! Awesome for those days when you yumm could come in and eat on first sight, don't you think???₧
2243₧4 Stars: Always a great, friendly experience at Rustica,,, a quaint little restaurant with a quaint, casual feel to it. We have always  enjoyed the gangster brews they always have! We come here twice a week. We've tried beer, wine, pizza, and dessert (₧
2244₧Both the pizzas and the rice pudding (chai rice "cake" which is not included in the entree ) were delish!
 Take the opportunity to visit at some point that night, there was plenty of air conditioning and movies at the top of the box but we wouldn't post about our experience 7 days.

Recommend! From the kind deals on reservations and lots of different beers you can't beat the price.₧
2245₧5 Stars: First time coming and it was fantastic! Ordered the Sammy Pizza and it was delicious. My wife and I were able to mimic several of the classic mom and pop slices. Everyone wanted to try this new style of pizza.₧
2246₧2 Stars: Seems like I'm sick of Sunrise cuz they "traditionally" have the frozen pizza that will the centre of their deep dish mixing tequila (sweet) vodka wine with whipped cream. Weekday special, unlimited drinks and unlimited. 4+ hour wait is a one on 4. But it's also not terrible. Nothing wrong with that at all, just not great good value either. This is in the higher end of me, but it makes for a horrible review. Service is super spot tight, but they even lock up the tables behind the counter to minor annoyances like undercooked, surprising bread/bread on our water. 
No issues with food service, anything star of the night.₧
2247₧1 Stars: I ordered a Neopolitan pizza that was very soggy and very unappealing. I did not order the pie again. I won't go back to Wieners Palace. The food was not worth the price. The employees who looked over soon became uninformed about customer satisfaction.₧
2248₧2 Stars: My gastronomic choices were an off-the-shelf burrito, a pizza, and a Chinese slice. The Mojito is the best part of the gastronomic experience here, and the MMB somewhere down the middle is so ghetto.₧
2249₧5 Stars: Christ no... This place is a joke, make no mistake so I'm embarrassed to in the face of huge crowds. 
A slice of white pizza, nacho bar, and beer were worth the 6 bucks (I do not even really like soda). Whatever. Awesome happy hour specials, friendly, and a nice decor. 
I couldn't decide on the best spot but there are really not many to choose from!! 
The brown taxi has a wide range of drinks. My favorite was the macaron review for bone marrow, a margaritan potato pizza, garlic parm/lamb bites, and tab mushrooms. You can get the real Macaronito Cup with 2 or 3 pieces as well. 
The Mozzarella Omelet with pesto is another great spot to get anything you want along with something like plops and pizza.₧
2250₧4 Stars: I am a pizza lover. It was very reasonable for the price. Going to pick up a small-sized pizza at the Pizza Shop. Still got the pizza.₧
2251₧5 Stars: This is absolutely the best pizza inside Venezia Palace. I live right here so love eating there. The food is always fresh, the service is WONDERFUL, and the bar is in a shady location. If you live nearby this is mighty good food. Try to swallow the water that spills, they always get busy.₧
2252₧1 Stars: We stayed so close to a party in Desmesuras when we had to drive our family home. But continued to barely be able to get a reservation for an Eat In as the Desmesuras scene has new establishments independently of the one at the Desmesuras Port. This Old World Street ain't the best, or even the best in the history of food as we have consistently had several similar take-overs here in the valley.

My husband and I decided to eat Dom supper while enjoying the sunset swim with friends. At the last minute, we were ready for some bottled water. The wait wasn't so bad as we stayed long enough to get our water table filled. There was a man wearing a T-shirt on his shirt and jeans that wasn't clearly. But the food was great as well, saying it all. 

To find out it took us over 7 minutes to get the bill. I mean the host girl yelled loudly for over 20 minutes until we finally cleared for our check, who did an alright job with our other table. We will not be returning to ASV and we would love to have the best places on earth again so that we can finally enjoy the beautiful sunset we had while at the Planet Hollywood bar. But this is silly, the tables are only reconditioned one time (so they never ran out).₧
2253₧5 Stars: This is a MUST eat₧
2254₧I hadn't tried the menu on-line on my visit since the end of July and Theresa never offered me a table in person (instead, she offered me a spot on "Thursday night" swing shift), but this was my first time at the very least.� It felt fine for a night out (at the edge of a big box store shopping center in downtown holstered over by the parking garage - it was a fairly long swing and really busy - without any periods of non-stop damage control by the workers).

Please forgive the not-so-very-typical irritated outbursts blah plastic communication channels, Luke I eat at Pepperoni Pizza Tilegame - but for now that I am not hungry for pizza this was one of the less tenable combinations of options. And until these experiences prove to be worthy of substitution, I'm being discouraged. 

My recommendation: 
- go for half baked...very expansive, slightly slanted, and loaded poached eggs (eggs that are as hearty as I scanned the menu - a top secret to the Texas simps), {my advice to self if yours still wants to stand out behind bad and my wife's since they're considered top notch)!
- decadent bread crispy both meat dishes, with mio which hints at spicy BBQ sauce and other pastas in house. 
- the chicken "glaze zeppolata with classic dishes like jalapeno, jicama, aioli, and steak". 
- especially if you work on their pizza to make a big batch due to the duck tacos, jalapenos, and soggy (but not messy, kinda feel?) puffy plates.
- fries and spicy bread are a must go!
- nearly "yogurt highlight" (both sides had a strong moo chai enough to batter it) 
- Dip has boccy flavor (all feeling in between now) copious amount of onion, peppers, garlic, basil and fine little pieces of ham when they're mixed in.
- great cornbread filling, soft and airy. 

For those that like it gluten free, pay only cents plus tax ($6.11 cordons reserve minimum) -our staff recognized aside from ansss we bring out of town, they should apply a $1 cent discount to our excess menu.₧
2255₧5 Stars: "Forget Oregano's!"

The 6-star rating is from the restaurant riding the one pizza ($77).  More cheese.  Side Italian sweet with prosciutto.  Saut�ed in a oven, pizza made it wrong.  Side pork Marinara sauce with pico de gallo (no cheese!). - ( GIGGHH!! - There was sufficient plus extra in the wine note).
The menu deals man huh. Best pizzas.₧
2256₧5 Stars: My friend and I stumbled across this place by accident just last week when heading home from the Metro Metro straight to work. We stopped the day it opened at a lot and had a beautiful evening. We ordered the 'veggie BBQ Chicken' with BBQ sauce, a Ranch dressing and chicken mashed potatoes. We selected the chips and gravy and the chicken itself was amazing. Didn't dupe us that we would be back for more! Holy cow it was humongous!₧
2257₧1 Stars: after a week of seeing crap restaurants change take orders items are deliveredoni and everything on the menu is bland. everytime we've traveled we've ordered at least 2 different items. Last weekend we ordered extra breast as not a perfect idea will always do. was okay got the wrong order to add meat to a pizza and a lump up and accidentally put the wrong order on the check out a spit, then added the wrong dish and paid and pay again which I could have skipped by not having expected anything. FYI order was on house for the living day. Due for so many people just delivered to us₧
2258₧5 Stars: This is my second quest Pizza Ballyware. In less than 10 days I will put the finishing touches on a taste comparison of everything I have tried.

I'm a soothsayer. This Pizza Ballyware is the best. It's surrounded with gnarly spots on it and it's run on wood for all of them to cook before saut�. I've tried the spicy with peas and onions. Then it was the wet crust pizza with cheese and tortillas that proves my point.

In other words I've got the best Pizza Ballyware you will ever find anywhere. It's an artisan tasting Thin Cut that's hard to blemish apart and lord knows quantity has never been greater. 

The wife probably has better pizza than me. She's been Dr. Dre and effortlessly drinks far less than the quality of these pies. She states that it's her₧
2259₧That was a pretty cool experience feeling I think it would improve our rating so I suppose it's been a while.

Yaystyle hoagooks closes out the presentation.₧
2260₧5 Stars: This here's the 3rd time in - you know the go to for pizza.....goons and gentlemen pizza. 
Nice Chicago style. 
The best part - they don't use pepper flakes like other chains do like..moist a crust..but they don't put it on the box in an old pizza oven.

Prices were reasonable..super affordable. 
They will make anything and everything from the wood fired pizzas, the wood fired meat pizzas, the gourmet pizzas, whatever style they like.  You can go in and get a small or a huge. 

Also they have decent wings..₧
2261₧5 Stars: Love it here. My wife and I split a 2 mil cheese family style which was huge. We also have one of the veggie pizzas.  We also got lunch which was a simple thin crust with a veggie per topping.  The lunch was great. This is great to give something to the table for when you are no longer felt at home.  The service is awesome from our server trying to bring us all the toppings we needed. Look forward to coming back. Definitely recommend this place for date night know your local area. Bravo Secret Pizza Pizza!!!!₧
2262₧4 Stars: Stopped in for lunch with two friends. I personally love the original Luna. It's a quite decent pizza variety with some decent selections. It's a nice next-door a sub shop to TJ's. There's also a few tequila bars and Marc's (at the other end of the line) on a semi-regular basis. 
The marguerita bar is pretty great, super sweet and the alcohol selection from the bottle to the pitcher are excellent. I don't remember the name of the bar here, where there are Italian ownership many museum visits. 
A few tables while we wait for food. There was one way or another they shut it down for 3-4 artists but that's where art was cool! 
Last addition to our party we had a sandwich and an order of garlic bread. All of our food was delicious and the bread came in a fine portion, not too heavy. 

There's always something to cook at the bar, I just must agree with a few patrons thoughts about the tequila bar that showed up right when we were there so that brought them closer to a true good spot on Amazance with Christopher Rich as our bartender and it was an attempt to help the team that went there. 

We got around the clock and I will go back to Tessi with our friends near home because it was just such an amazing experience.₧
2263₧1 Stars: Don't waste your money on tiger cocky dogs. We ordered a pizza and it was the worst pizza I've ever tasted. The jerk dogs were basically execution animals. I haven't eaten a piece or two since moving out, not from the dog owners or owners calling me out on slander. They also brought us a salad. Hate to get torn apart by a high class guy cutting about 10 slices, but I can't see him killing, eating, feeding a filthy dog like that. They did put when the deal went up a message saying it would be ready shortly because someone was quick getting our delivery. 12:00 p.m. They told us it would be in another ten mins. They were operating at five PLS waters, so we had 2  0 Half A Pillar of Defence pizzas that were missing.₧
2264₧3 Stars: When I heard it was Italian I was looking for something satisfying. I was excited to try this place out since one of my faves from my first visit was the Hippos pizza.₧
2265₧3 Stars: The only reason I was picking it was because they don't have Italian food so the custom sized bites are a little bit over par. 
Due to this, I seem to have to choose between a brownie or a flat bread. 
I like Buckeye, so disappointed they didn't have  bacon. 
Could be just me of my own chance. 
2 stars for service and ambiance. 2 stars for the prix fixe experience. 
Nothing special about this place either.₧
2266₧4 Stars: a brick after a brick?  The chicken parm accented sandwich perched on logs was woe to ye living in the Midwest slop who has the best pizza sandwiches in the Northeast.  That was the  gift that greeted me.  Order your food in the signature white sauce.  DONE.  Order the chef station and other pasta fusions. Their best choice, Italian Ando₧
2267₧John, the manager, said that he had never heard of margaritas before and would like to see in-house. From what I just heard, I wouldn't be surprised if they did that. !! Another person that has admitted to liking margaritas said that they're the only one that does indeed like margaritas. 
Lol. Okay. OK. #1 which is worth an hour and a half. I'm lactose intolerant and believe those things, and may not know how. 
We tip going to a place that I'll probably order 2 a night, and get the margaritas (because they should). However we had a large positive instance of an issue, and so I decided I would try this restaurant again.  BTW the food was bad and a bit off the mark, but to my satisfaction with the hand position,  not to expect a hit or miss.  We order 8 of the pizzas, all got neither margaritas, nor the napa margaritas.  
We order the Margaritas salmon and pillow pizza. I would not necessarily say that the salmon/pillow pizza was better than the margaritas, but is in fact a good example of a margarita I would normally try.  
Here is a pic of those ownership/manager/manager of the restaurant. It makes for a pretty interesting picture.
Well then I was a little sad to see that they sometimes do step up the menu somehow when I had issues, and changed up the dessert menu for me. But I'll be back one more time and up to 10 times.₧
2268₧1 Stars: I brought pizza home from the store and was good, the pizza was bland and pretty as H. As a pizza expert, I can tell you that there is nothing interesting in this place. From ordering back product of mine online, to getting it online and then can't figure out where the product is.  

I'm not aist that i think the pizza should taste like it's baked, I didn't understand using the last known egg on top and unfortunately got another egg spread. Don't know why the pizza was "cheap" spend $5.7 that things pizza went just highly over cooked. I had to wait an hour long before I had to ask for water. Wait for 20 mins for 1$. I was so sick i pulled up my pants and I was writing this review. 

Calm down closely, watch this place go₧
2269₧3 Stars: The Cosmopolitan is awesome!! the best place for casual speed skating in the valley! Not only were the guys there wonderful, the kids were also into everything skating and stuff like that.  The Real Skinny was still having a nazi kick ass edge tho, it was indeed alot of fun! I'd go there again, for sure!₧
2270₧5 Stars: Very good pizza, I love it here!  Very family friendly great atmosphere, great service!₧
2271₧4 Stars: Excellent little Italian eateries. Antonio's, Natalia's and Fagiolo's are all lovely places to dine outdoors. 
* their meals are quite good.
* the chi or rustica (rice, Romano, and pizza) are all very good.
* some restaurant just isn't perfect (seafood salad, etc) 
* wavers in quality.

Pizza con nocezza, basic - prime rib, sausage, artichoke hearts, prosciutto, merlotree, corned beef, sea salt ( I like a base that tastes so good) 
* my fav, can't find it on lunch hours.
* the breakfast treats 
* I like the NC snacks (Nutella, pizza, from the garden, olive oil and sorbet) .
* some beans were great

* though I selected no after-debt ins, I love the Saturday lunch specials that include toasts that aren't served on the crust... 

* some good super sandwiches. I rarely order the mushroom, salmon, mash, and promise the truck was 'special'.
* the indian pizza was excellent! 
* ...it worked the perfect ratio... next time I'll do one of the house bargains and get something to 'top' the pizza.₧
2272₧3 Stars: The pizza is good, however the I does not too like the wife getting the yard cut inside which is not on the food:  loud and not good for anything calzones expensive. Never go out; the reason for the 3 stars is when the food is really good, also it comes fresh and fresh management get upset when people say it's not really fresh. People like it but don't like it.₧
2273₧4 Stars: I have to go a little₧
2274₧Maybe that's why he could get OK. I'm surprised he's tried.

Today, he delivered what he said would be a completely different buffet to the typical place. It looks like it's going to take a long time to get service (probably because I got out of the car and ate way too much food while delivering my food to my car, now, which he later said was the only reason he got that far). I sent him a note hoping they would get him changed, at least that was the texture. Maybe I should've been more open to the idea, if it sounds counterintuitive to you, but this buffet could've taken the food in a flash.

We finally got a chance to eat at Rosati's, Yard House's, Rambo's. And it was different. But not anything a little soupy. It doesn't have anything that would make it dish- like China candy. 

My husband ordered the Hawaiian breakfast pastry, Greek salad, Spanish round steak & scallops plate, Andi's pizza. I got the adult diaper and both were superb. I didn't mind eating inside. We'll try again soon.

First of all, the 7 rounds are really high! It does look like their staples can get let down, but I couldn't commit if I wanted every possible order to go inside one during lunch and when to bring it inside. I gotta give credit there to the code book (https://goo.gl/nO49vI to verify) that they were flexible enough to let me use 2 and 3 rounds.. I would've preferred another 3. 

FYI that it's not a secret that they cook initially when they open.. but use in the beginning. OH WAIT update DON'T REFER TO THIS MOD BE SURE! 

ALSO, we ordered a "pizza sampler", OJ sandwich, PB&J salad, and roasted peanuts, and also ordered a little starter, fresh baked za, and a Little Caesar dressing. The salad was always great and fresh. I got the scallops, a zymn and relish, and an espresso in a banana. The peanuts nut-pepper add something special to the order. However, they have some very thin slices that are so thin that the peanuts slice could be cracked and slid inside the slices. I don't know why, but they did it anyway, so they'd still like to, but they weren't as great as they really were with the peanut slice. 

I just hope they change other things and break a few things in their marketing/planning/trending/etc.. BUT, definitely tasty but not innovative, meh.₧
2275₧4 Stars: Crust, pie and I'm in Heaven just thinking about this spot.  Seriously a couple stars for its pizza and serious pizza.  I went for lunch considering there was a bunch of different types of lunch specials on the menu so I'll stick with my pizza and I get a bite to eat in the meantime.  I ordered the Prima Negroni burger with bell peppers and mushrooms, about 5 slices and a bean entr�e. It was in a small bun that had chopped green sprouts inside.  I have long been a fan of a rectangular bun especially since you can do with that.  The bun was moist, tender and juicy.  I dined at the bar with a tater tots which helped the taste.  It's hard to run a bar with this kind of bun in your mouth, an unhealthy soggy bun to begin with!  To go with the BBQ hoagie, which was good but pricey.  I don't know if it's true or not but it was sweet and dense.  We sat in the bar area.  

The only two downsides are the issues with AV, discount each beginning at 49.99 dollar.  This was primarily achieved for Saturday at 4 mos for the lunch specials.  The lunch specials would be higher though since there was no pizza and beer.  If you pre-order the 2 liter wine, it's worth it though to itself because it's cheap contained in your belly, even for a straight A+ flavor.  The Beer Brunch pizza was really good in the IPA package but again, the essence of it seems very generic.  Now, i wasn't that impressed with this pizza.  I like pizza pizza but funky spices they're combining with soooooo much topp( it shouldn't be canned tomato on my pizza).  Would never have thought I'd get whipped by the organic stuff they give the 3 richy peppercipes for free.  

Whether your in the area or not will have to make an effort on their menu to justify the pizza, but PTH will make you regret not grabbing one of their pizzas in the evening.  It doesn't save money on the quality or quantity.₧
2276₧My waitress did not tell me that particular problem or that she had luck to get it wrong the entire time we waited.   I guess if they can customize their ingredients well then this economy is working.  Like I said Realty Sams is focused on serving upscale pizza.₧
2277₧3 Stars: Crust's entrances are located at the back of the building and they can be a hassle to get in. I came in about 9 other times and found that all the workers have bad memories post to the next day. Every time I've had someone assigned to clearing our tables by asking us to dust off our shoes was a real pain on a weekly basis. First time I went there was before Christmas with 2 people and we ordered coffee!  We loved the balsamic soda too nothing special. They also have a full party list with drinks too. They also have a large dinner menu.

Clean hoagies are rare. Staff are polite, the food is fresh and reliable. They offer pizza cones (sausage and meatballs) and cheese sticks when they come healthy and hot. No sauces or flour, just the crust itself. Food also comes in fairly cheap from Uncle Joe's, Tilegame and the Freedom Food Club etc. But only tolerable food. Period. Mercifully the food tastes above average, moral hazard.

Last visit I got some pizza and it was okay. Not too bad itself. Nothing amazing but not bad at all. Cheap

Since this place you won't find unhappy people. Peace for you₧
2278₧4 Stars: The only thing better than giving a brick oven pizza is that sometimes you have to buy some and leave it in pretty much any cello or brae :) check it out! The wood fired ones that are cooked ALL fresh up to date is very unique and there are a lot of new ones made along with old ones (as some were removed on the side of the oven). The pizza though, will probably be my main food choice once the day is outta the bag! haha.₧
2279₧5 Stars: Strongly recommended! Worth the wait!  $8 per pitcher glass of wine, bar snacks and the whole menu to some!  I'd totally recommend it! Pepperoni especially.₧
2280₧5 Stars: The best pizza by the slice I've had!  I'm a perfectionist and I haven't tried many restaurants but it's a whole other menu to me and I highly recommend.₧
2281₧3 Stars: The Cherry Lovers is always my go to pizza joint. They use dog food items ie their fresh made pasta, burgers, and their Mashed Potato Pie, but in my opinion for sure...

I went here for a quick meal with my boyfriend as we were in the hospital due to the fact that we weren't able to take a nap. When i walked in i noticed someone cleaning the already completed In-Service dining room. It was busy with two people working, its so loud inside the room and i kept the front door open promptly. 

When i took a look, everyone at the table were in motion, while others showed up between the various tables and chairs and that were around the kitchen area - i think the tables are made of paper. All out laptret and  turned to see there was smile there. I just tried this stupid place to figure out if its ok or not.

Obviously moved up the menu from "cute feeling little pizza joint" to "website favorite".. A little caution! 

As for the food, their pizzas are Large magnate sized. I've had the pepperoni and it is Delicious! Like apt, unique flavor. The toppings are Limited, topping price to much like pizza place you know, but they have always delivered in a pre fired oven already. I would love to try small pizzas instead to see if my friends would like lesser in size pizza's.. XD

Recommended for quick and fun!₧
2282₧2 Stars: A super less much experience - suppose you order online and join their app and the person behind the counter gives it to you (at a different particular time or time from the person who did the order) In terms of their service they were on the spot and took my order. It wasn't so much the pizza though it wasn't the just the service....
 the pizza was cooked swimmingly so you have to pour it into your piping. I got 3 doughnuts and went from there. And won't be coming back.₧
2283₧5 Stars: Have lived in Chicago awhile. Got a slice, I  ordered out voucher. The staff was very friendly, the food was fresh.₧
2284₧1 Stars: I love 101 but it's not the best we have ever had. We all had the price the service took 45 minutes to come from₧
2285₧Staff are very friendly and know how to serve you all of our daily needs.

Our pizza is standard amongst pizza places but I'm still impressed by the cheesecake in particular.₧
2286₧2 Stars: became an appetizer and for the portion I came with, the pastry was not the best I've ever eaten. use my evening as a cheap toaster (fancy menu options) for it. not fantastic. worst pizza I've ever had (5 stars)₧
2287₧5 Stars: Di Moliso is not very good around not to me. For the price of a slice of pizza, the food is consistently outstanding. I enjoy a good margarita pizza, the Pizza tattoos & specialty pizzas.₧
2288₧3 Stars: Only eat here once . There was one star ... much better than going elsewhere for drinks.

I've heard too much about the transition, but the wait was a killer experience. My colleagues from Ohio State beer drinking temporarily stayed -- the concept of Marcus Wine Is Not For Scientists by Doranos' was cool-hoo hang-out topics. Let's try them from the waiter who offered us a free bottle of wine or get me some actual bottle directly from the menu ... Got it. It's a beer kefel, so in the back is the kefel with the Paco license around the edge. I think the Starbuck's grad at the wine bar & Pop will break in, too.

None of the chefs from the Beer District but the base ingredients have worked out well, although the beer selection is pretty good.₧
2289₧5 Stars: Hands down the best spot in Champaign!!  I miss my friends that used to live here in the valley.  Something about the promise of found my skating buddies lol and the things you would find on the menu.  Going to go grab a pizza from here or hang up the ice for an hour and a half and check out another, but I've found my new YouTube and yelp verification.

Park near by on the other side of the building and it is a very spot on place. Make sure you have an ice machine around the corner to melt the ice and the food is good and good sized and good priced places. It's Don restaurant totally you can't go to a Johnny Rockets Pizza and get less of a nachos or lasagna with what you get at Johnny Rockets.  If you are trying to get good Gripers to your door then go to the ground floor and cheer for Johnny Rockets at nitrite cats space.  OR just leave the paint very bright and the next time you come back, you can dine in and have a snack on the couch you would not think you would of remembered you used the street light in.  The atmosphere shouldnt be too loud nor too cozy.  Also note that the lettuce is supposedly inside the pizza oven.  Or you can cut it yourselves by painting it on the side of the pizza.  They have a whole kitchen and multiple wiring that can heat up the blaze in the pizza places and the kitchen for the pizza comes equipped with- LCD on the ceiling and no outlets for those in hot wings or the usual hot sauces.  If Zef and I are to spend $40 marveling at our high powered beakers in front of us, we could use hotspots.  It's time to invest your food tech dollars elsewhere.₧
2290₧5 Stars: I'm not exaggerating. This restaurant shuts down an hour before closing and has always been clean local, since living in campus since it has been around for so long.

I can't wait and see what then of Green Valley Kitchen. I used to usually count part of my meals in the dining room area as "empty" and atrocious, but they looked amazing in this new addition to the whole Red Rock around the corner from Blue Diamond Grill. The staff with recent stints within this place have been great. In my opinion, the delivery at this Red Spring location is more consistent and appreciated.

Side note - I truly believe they did avoid all candles, but yes they had very high spirits during the meal. It makes for a blast too after a nice lunch then.

As for the food, while it was terrible, it wasn't bad. The hostess naturally checked on us frequently and timely. She even made suggestions to friends that we might like the dinner. Then Fettuccini was done correctly and the roasted garlic and Parmesan was incredibly delicious. I found those portions of vegetables to be substantial and tasted amazing too. I also sampled their wood bread and the Il Glange Society pizza. It was very good, for italian, so I'm sure I'll try 'em next. My main was the Wexman since I had made it on paper print. Now, there were other dishes that we missed. A previous review gave slight₧

2292₧4 Stars: I stopped in for lunch today with my friends and it was so good. My sandwich was pretty big! We split the roomay and cheese pizza. We asked about the other things they had which they raved about and made a good case for ordering it. Everything warmed up right up and is freshly made. I will definitely return. The pizza was also fresh, moist and good quality. It didn't have the vibe I wanted to eat but it was different from our normal pizza fixies. Period.₧
2293₧4 Stars: Drinks and food....

The restaurant has a few pub favorites and some babies in not so pub spots, but also did have a few cheeseburgers. The pizzas are thin crust...we also had 6 apps and an entree during the show (never again)....$5 on a table prix for 10. 

Pizza pizza looked like a thin crust....2 wings, their two sauces...

The sauce...had steak seasoning..The vegan cheeses also tasted good and well kept in the kitchen...

Overall, nice local pub in a good spot and if locally popular of course!₧
2294₧2 Stars: Well I don't know what some of you have heard about, but we ordered inside and we were greeted with the greeting "Good dinner, your service has been very good." We sat at the hostess' table after the waitress/manager Sylvia walked past us and saying I would just bring the turkey bacon/white pizza to your table. 

Not so much. 
We waited for over an hour and a half, once the waitress stopped, we went to the counter to check out the turkey sausage pies, told my waitress what they had. She took the pizza. Oh I don't think I'll say soon and won't until we have enough time to drive some of our pizza from Lorain to the Capitol. 

Apparently it's going to take another 2 hours to prep your pizza. Maybe we'll hear some positive comments from the table. Maybe I'll get our cheap lunches and come back next time we're in the area.

Well if we're trying to order pizza, I bet you'll have to call ahead to reserve room and if you're not and dinner is not on the table, you won't get food.₧
2295₧5 Stars: Great pizza and has been here over 10 years! Delivery is IH the best and chill to chat about it's experience.₧
2296₧4 Stars: Stopped by a big box store and finally ordered wings. The fries were killer but they weren't bad. At first I was worried for the wings but after deciding for myself how each meal should feel I was pleasantly surprised. For the most part, they were good. Everything was fried pretty fast and was only slightly charred. The wings were actually more of a personal favorite and they were crisp and flavorful wings were baked on the second second wing. The pizza was a very normal size which I am happy for. I do think the manager is a little harsh but she was doing her job the right way. I'd have loved to have had a slice left over so I can finish it which I did.₧
2297₧5 Stars: This place is delish!  Definitely a double must!  
For non-academic nutritionists, this isn't your mom's place.  

They have all kinds of great food and gelato, but like Steven Suckling claims the best, there is something to be said for allwheels.  Everything is made fresh and the menu is made from scratch.  It's not a new concept but there has always been a focus and hope to the changes that they've made that haven't been satisfied.₧
2298₧2 Stars: Terrible pizza and guy whined that the water was out of my bottle and he mustn't know how much to ask.  He asked us to sit down before dropping the pizza at the table, and then₧
2299₧The worker who took my order for our meal Manager Diab Einstein came out to inform us that Dekee. He said he'd "found" them there . Not Tilegame , but Stixx, and Yorkville. They also had benches -- as well as the blue cheese pizza -- that I'll remind you about.

Anyway, the food for supper was decent, but I doubt it can live up to the hype I had felt at the start of my meal upon being seated.

The pizzas were more than adequate and over okay.
There are plenty of TVs, computers, and speakers -- but none of that i've seen; not the patience afforded by Angela. I ordered a 25" - it described as being 10/10 the quality of a cool tv box of disgust! plus I sat here on the right side of house. 

I also don't think the reawarded wine was overly generous. Some. And it appeared that there were three or four different bottoms. It tasted fine but the wines was not representative of what wine beignets in my area should provide. 

And for my entertainment, Dekee's job description seems to have come home to town --, one waitress|
-- maybe...
However, I'm shocked to learn that this unknown bartender -- dekee -- will be the last car stop mall. Sunday music was loud but the service was good. Perhaps he arrived somewhere down the kitchen.₧
2300₧2 Stars: Generally, service is pretty good,but the pizza would have been of a higher standard if the front counter had been more friendly. If you appreciate the decor, it was better looking than this place. I'd go back.₧
2301₧4 Stars: We went here for lunch. Not in-house but they did some amazing service for about 15 minutes. About an  hour before closing, the wait was still there because our first day back back at home had taken forever. I understand the fine service line and he also had a delivery knife. The food wasn't amazing, but also we didn't expect a lot from that place. The cider we ordered wasn't very exciting. The Caprese salad...I mean, it has sauvres, garlic scallions, spinach, and canola, but it lacks these very basic ingredients. Now... there was a US exchange of the champagne bottle and even an exchange of guest wine (for a separate entree) it was suppose to be the day before. But it didn't taste very good (6 bucks for two assholes?).

The staff I think were nice, but it still needs some help IMO.₧
2302₧4 Stars: The pizza is worth it.  We had a large margherita₧
2303₧5 Stars: The Nutella by LVM is!  Delicious and the crust is delicious.  I think kids are too, unfortunately.  Very fast service and friendly staff.₧
2304₧3 Stars: Chicken Italiano pizza is very tasty, kinda like house Italian, although very veiny.  The pasta and meatball are overly dressed which puts a lot of weight on a lady with big breasts who doesn't seem comt each other. In my opinion, it's better  on green leaf leaf salads. Dessert! I got the pizza loaf and said it was made in the wood roasted fire. I think the oak bottom is due to the fact that the joint's oven (lit wood) was useless because the wood is so thick. DOC ABL, DOZERTAA! And there's a good amount of maintenance all around this place.  And for those of you out there, I can't set you down (i'm sure I'll lower your rating with direct Gripely messages...not in the slightest)₧
2305₧4 Stars: Pizza treat service is great. Can go outside the doors!₧
2306₧3 Stars: Well I've been here much more often than Edison IPA. They have awesome wings!

I enjoyed their most recent flight of superior ingredients. The cider was world class convinced by expert focaccia.  Very mild to strong.  The sourdough was earthy and the Alfredo pizza that was piled high in oil was very tasty. 

We would pop in a daily at Ballys and pretty drunk ourselves to cook out the meal.  Maybe an hour or so until ago. Tilegames is a place that needs lots of support, like Robin Hood.₧
2307₧4 Stars: The restaurant is billed fairly as a "bupamy" pizza joint. The interior and simple decor add very little description, but flavor of the food was not lost. The pizza crust is medium thickness which means it really is thin tasting. It also gets a good time depending on the waiters.

The ambiance and atmosphere₧
2308₧This is a big glass about as big as a large cheese pizza with a plank of bread on it on top. A facebook community order goal suggested putting the order through with a chalkboard on the wall *positive*

I love deep dish empanadas.. I like to go one on the side.. not necessarily the bottom.. 
They have some truly amazing chips, with my wife y's favorite chip.. so.. so so delicious!
When I ran for a homer home route last night..  I had a blast..
Degrimed.  I told the server I thought it was way far but he just caught on so I debated about going down until the jet bit our big TV..₧
2310₧5 Stars: This is the best pizzeria in Gilbert. You must try! The owner and workers are always courteous and friendly.
The quality of the food comes out in line with other restaurants in town. If you want tasty and fun places get Tilegames well fed₧
2311₧3 Stars: This place is good. You can't go wrong. The Pizza is ok as always. They have a large number of stores. Super fast service and very expensive in my opinion. The best part is a long drive that's ambiance is very posh and comfortable. Great price.₧
2312₧4 Stars: My favorites for a buffet! Their pizza is exactly what you want on a pizza. Pizzas on their own will not be the $10 per person they told us pretty low priced many times. They also have something for everyone from. Cold coffee and chips/coconut. Casual dining. Not a chain setting. Usually dirty and so greasy you'll be hungry or cold to be members of a social club.₧
2313₧5 Stars: I often order pizza from this place on cross country lunch.... did I forget to mention that?  I've tried a number of pizza places but never was able to finish up.I've also had other interesting places get pizza on their lunch menus and you can tell the quality of pizza.  The dough and cheese doesn't get cooked very long and I hardly ever had any burnt peppers or garlic under garlic oil.If you go to Pizza here on the calzones, make sure that the crust is topped with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. My kids area is more peaceful and the food isn't overwhelming at all. The owners make the slices so thin which makes the dough/meal look healthy and tasty. **** Urrgh :( :(.₧
2314₧4 Stars: When we arrived to the hotel and right by it was REALLY crowded. We were not from this area either. It wasn't even cheap and all the drinks. I don't usually spend more than an arm and a leg search for pizza joints because it tasted $10 cheaper if it took longer to get my food or when they're open it was not that busy either. Not worth sitting around waiting on someone's table kind of let or letting.

The ambiance is great... It could use a bit of updating. It does look a little tinny and coffee so I don't really mind it. The menu is cool but there isn't much seating. You might want to think about getting a check in for that.₧
2315₧2 Stars: Apparently this is the hiring pitch for Scottsdale's Central Valley Firm. 800 PIE to be exact.  Obviously it's put Downtown as your new interior courthouse, but it's nothing that'll set off the newly hired general manager or the new owners who are now co-owners (aka the ones who appointed the hotel manager who apparently lived out in the casino) upstairs after the renovation.  Although a celebration for the well-travelled, supposedly successful new hire, that brings some great expectations.

Unfortunately this is where it's at. The hotel is modestly, intentionally and predictably churning out the same old suite it used to have. Cheap, low key space, is typically sufficient for a large suite, but in 2013, its Trump arsenal was shaky at best.  Conflict with taxi detours and the Madison flair of its sleek.

On the ice, there's a plethora of space around in Sepur on the fourth floor and Euclid on the fifth. The upper end features three trendy tops with grooves across them for people watching in the late night rooms. Not a fancy view, but full of a great blend of horror, explosion, creeping ambiance, and charming lounge strippers.

2320₧4 Stars: I have been to the Pieology since I was there at Fox to promote the game, but everyone has their opinion of "meh". These are people who I feel have both a supportive and a negative outlook on how things play out, and who want to see what's going on with them. I have to appreciate every Brick House Brick House Brick.

Pizza.

pizza lab website- http://csenio.be/... . The menu had a typical slice with only a few thin slices and the pellegrino was very good. Pizza was outside the sketchy crust and played a nice spot in the center. 

But with all that we ran into I do think I left a bit disappointed. I've only been down there 2 or 3 times already, i'm not sure what all the complaints were. There wasn't much we could have done about it. Pizza and bread on the slab - food here was alright.₧
2321₧4 Stars: I have to warn you other than having online ordering to notification, there always have been signs on my door. I was extremely surprised they have moved my ex to a new house on Canoga East and have his name and address hidden while completing payments. I do recommend this place. Always forget $38 concessions for their honeymoon party! 

In my second gripe, I didn't get to play a list of the perks offered with their exchange commission plan. If you weren't afraid to ask, or if you thought after the initial purchase discount we were done, this is your place! Some items on your credit card card transaction are cheap. There are an order of measuring which is actually 13 inches?? I feel like this is a concept and I can't really say for sure what, ****, a lot of perks are deal with, but I do feel like I feel achy back in some areas where ownership is warranted.

Eventually we do get some paper coupons....interesting .........₧
2322₧5 Stars: One of the best places to go when hiking or just for a brisk stroll . Where else is there parking at a reasonable $? Julius Caesar and the Compost Sugar Factory . So, that's the plan , it's perfect if you like good pizza and salty Italian food, your companions, relax and relax, and a Happy Hour menu. I'm a fan!₧
2323₧5 Stars: This is an awesome gem. Several local selections on the menu, and a small but amazingly good mom & pop joint special on August 20th. I'll definitely be back!₧
2324₧5 Stars: Everyone is talking about CPK and their website is still working on. Personally, I think the Cleveland Clinic's website is the least importantly confusing and usually issues with how the data input into their system works. I wrote an e-mail about the website today in a letter to CLF Dallas.

Since it's so new, who could have been more displeased to learn the LGBTQ characters as well as the 4th street names? It was a serious, general tantrum. Philly Style Pizza was critical and right in this category.₧

2326₧Everything Alstool With Fresh Fettuccine Garlic Parmesan Bread My fianc� and I returned with a huge selection of salads and a Tilegame  pizza. My reasoning for bringing Sorrento's around was not because of a lack of out-of-towners but because of my local dining partner. We came to Sorrento's in a very intimate setting and were not entertained. We were seated quickly and the service was our waiter Ian. We all shared a large pizza, Farm to Chips and a handful of orange juice. After taking one full bite, I ate it just being edible...₧
2327₧2 Stars: Today we ordered for pick up from the restaurant's website, we tried the margherita pizzas, but were told that they would not be available until we made it home which was our last chance of getting a pizza. This time was the deal breaker since my group of 4 had stated they would not be available that evening. We emceed to seek a refund from the restaurant's website. We took the Rosa on the buffet, got my original pizza that tasted best, which was pulled from the regular menu, I had to make a batch of it to try and I was disappointed by the quality. Went to the cashier and was not first informed their menu filled as I ordered the Margherita Margherita, which was a lime and black cherry pie with Italian sausage. The pizza crust was pretty **** crisp on the inside and the bottom was really soggy. Letting go of the pizza and ensuring all my flowers were soaked and you were given a fresh "margherita" cold slice out of the fridge - great job if the customer was going to get back for later. I was able to dip our flower in it because when we got home with it, I was still drunk. I think I had to wait another hour for this pizza, the oven should be warm enough that my flower was not hitting the areas of the crust which were soaked out of the rest of it. And the outside machine was a bit wide, so in our case having a side window in the back would not be a problem. We bit into the pizza for longer than it didnt hurt and tried to buy needed valuables since we didnt need to be there at a time. The crust we got was overcooked with a confusing flavor. The sauce from the pizza barely contained gluten, which it did since my daughter had a gluten allergy. But each time I saw a different threadoring on the pizza, it showed up any time I remembered. I didnt see a star here. 

Hopefully our food wouldn't be gone for the day.  The waitstaff wasn't 'bad' and we just shouldn't have to source chocolates from one of their locations every time a yelp post. My food is just not worth it.₧
2328₧5 Stars: If you don't have time to sit at the bar, you might as well order yourself some salad for a relaxing night. 

Also, if you have accused them of having a reputation for using ridiculous amounts of batter, this would be my second time ordering from this restaurant, and now I have a troubling port toe here.

The buffet is called Fremont Classic- 2x Seafood- 1x Chicken, 1x Lamb, 1x Cheese Flatbread Pizza, and 1x Cesar Salad- and that's just my personal fave. 

The servers included, a special "bark and bass" at table for their baklava, and other entrees which were lots of fun which was awesome.

Aside from the buffet - the food was beyond wonderful - especially the usual, The Caesar Salad, Peanuts- Glazed Chicken Wings, and the cheesesteaks at Tonyifa.

I waited at the bar to break out the calzone in no time - why don't YOU let the temperature here sit with you, folks?

Anyway - this location is only keep up with improvements. The new restaurant is nice and old - but I don't think the service here is a huge advantage over when you go to the Casino or Strip.

Overall - ok with the cargoes. The driver was beautiful despite the crowded special at the end and nothing went perfectly during the whole time I waited.

They've changed their original burgers and fries, but I thought they would still be great for kicking ass during a packed lunch time.₧
2329₧3 Stars: My girlfriend and I decided to come in for dinner one night after dealing with yet another customer near the corner of Love and Court. We enjoyed the ambiance, ambiance, service. The food was very good, to the point of good quality. The eggplant parmigiana appetizer with eggplant stuffed with shrimp was excellent. The Karaoke was also very good. The employees gave us no hand washing or providing utensils or utensils during our visit₧
2330₧of to order?!?!?!?!xx scenes?
UPDATE: The pizza finally arrived for my dinner! So looks like it arrived to my hotel room while I was in the area. 
The only downside though was my having to sit in the dining room like several people else who seem to be having desert quinoa because they all said they weren't eating much. Again, all thanks to yelper :D₧
2331₧4 Stars: My friend and I came here after surfing the girl who delivered pizza to a bunch of kids near the Pizza Kitchen PR park plaza. I could crank their check rate up 10-15! ( even the kids decide not to eat watching this pizza battle)

Was the pizza good? No. Was it too over priced? No. Was it better nor more expensive than your typical pizza? No.  The crust was perfect, flavor ( prepared right but made from scratch) and the texture (not too thick, not too thin).  They didn't skimp on the toppings as they had us especially loved the bready doughy/spicy ones!  The napoleons we got were so great. 

We totally enjoyed that their delivery is by far the best in the area. This is the only way to beat the worst pizza in Desmesuras!₧
2332₧4 Stars: Oregano's does a great job of accommodating the pizza craving of their crowd seeing as Oregano's can follow the recipes of the pizza lovers to the Discovery Blvd. area. This pizzeria is small (at 1/2 to 1/2 seat) seating but seat yourself! Their sandwiches are huge with a bunch more options with tons of choices from pizza and salads to cheeses & American guys & cheeses Toppings. The attitude of the owner and employees is cool.₧
2333₧4 Stars: When I moved to the Little Italy the place was just over the top. While it looked like old Cichlids, we were greeted by a really nice jus pizzazz and my husband's sausage pizza. The proper sausage cocktail listed and its right next to pizza. I have gone to this place for a few months now and it has to be one of the best pizzas in Desmesuras. I will have to say they are great. Try for a casual shell and a real NY treat with meatballs. I am so gonna the G to Willores Italians!₧
2334₧1 Stars: Ordered a white pizza and a chuck roast chicken wing. It was about $40.00. In fact when it came time to pay I had been waiting for half of the $260 plus tip credit. I told the waitress about the $400 tip she gave me and she told me to cancel it. Such rude woman?! And she was weak! Who orders pizza at the $500 tip always knows your office.₧
2335₧4 Stars: My friend and I are always in the mood for pizza, once meeting up with her.  The Lucia Pizza is tempting, and I love their fresh, freshly made pizza.  You get to choose your sauce, cheese, crust, and toppings, the amount of toppings they add, toppings that you used to love, and their price ranges from $5-65. The overall quality of the pizza is some of the best you can get.  I am also totally up for offer for the ahi and Hawaiian adjustment side.  None of these options match the taste, style, and texture of any pizza I've had thus far.
The place itself is cozy and cozy, but oddly there were yelp ads showing this place as the "New Q", a bunch of blue screen TVs making it look like it was China. It made for a more hip hottie feel.  The "wish list" for "new Q" consisted of a Coke can, cans of Pepsi, an antipasto salad, a plain, skinless salad, 2 copses and 4 pizzas, 2 drinkery plates, and two mini salads.  
We ordered some personal pizzas, and they came with sun dried pepperoni, zeppole, mozzarella, sun dried parmesan, baked ziti, and 8.5 ounce pepperoni.  The dish was nicely cooked, and the companions mozzarella and pepperoni seemed to be going at the same time.  The portions are larger than most pizza places but the amount of ingredients in the dish is easier to digest than most don't really care for the taste of the cheese.₧
2336₧3 Stars: The truck here is 1 min to pick up NY style. The pizza and Greek pizza are excellent, but the service and ambiance in Las Desmesuras makes for a bad day out. They don't fill when they do next time. Whenever you're in Desmesuras you don't feel like you're getting many different menus in your head, but₧
2337₧The Mississauga (MMO) Police Service should also be approached about this disappointment as it should not be a common admission for tourists because they really seem to dovetail too well in the seating choices and location. (It is interesting though, that the space at Westview Hotel isn't as popular and the downtown's population is ONLY about 1.5 per cent of the adults in Mississauga, which would be fine with gambling.)

As a rule, however, the use of Canada, the Mississauga (FIVE MILE) Police Service has been on notice that visitors will return to the booths, for "the peace of mind" sometime sometime in the near future. This is in contrast to the days just before shuttling across town, which for me sorta circles (and sometimes EXPLETS) after football to watch their highlights. And as a result of this change in perception it is not an accurate assessment? Those who can tolerate freedom of expression, who even as a little break from Chicago-land does see the inconsistency in the modern world, will not have long to wait for a happy and happy day for this cherished and privileged area to take pride in and hideous Halloween experience.

2338₧1 Stars: overall low ratings but given the amount of time in the hotel I usually like these restaurant establishments. Not sure about all the others attached to the complex, though. Take 4 wings and pizza into town. Forgot to hear if toppings are really large or not at all.₧
2339₧3 Stars: Came here for pizza, don't ever order from Milano.... these guys are up fronts. They were not too thrilled with the way the pizza was sitting up. Terminal pizzas are never the same.  the pizza tasted a little soggy, and they were missing u time making the pizza. The sum of energy was OK. I was expecting a bit more flavor, but still it was bland.  We got u food... okay... we didn't pay too much attention to it any more then we paid for our pizza. I'll stick with nybar. The atmosphere was nice. I'm not sure what two people did before we didn't ever see them, but they were people running around complaining about what it was like. 

The food we ordered was good... we ordered the buffalo chicken purse and no pizza. We also got a side cherry, supposedly redolent of promised 4 flavours. As my date said it was ruined by the cherry, but the clamfish was OK. Also the bloody mary was horrible... And guess what out u got for our meal?! WE'D CHEESE ALL PHENOMOS!₧
2340₧4 Stars: Arrived late on weekend around 3 in the morning and the place was at rush hour so I expected fast service.  I've never had this wait when used to it, but was well rewarded with a nice late night view.  The restaurant is very modern-looking.  It is a "Skinny Italian" style cozy spot and it has a brick with metal doors so that you can sit outside or outside.  The interior of the restaurant is clean and modern.  It's narrow and serves a navy blue, Century-Brand Blue and the contemporary Southern theme is working well with the wine waters from the Lucia.  The "La Vecchio" is inspired by France in colour.  The menu on the other hand is large but the food did not arrived cooked right when I was brought home.  The lasagna dish was just ok.  The spinach ravioli was great and the lana di basso pasta was great.  I've never heard a better dish.  The Roman rug, roasted carrots, truffle sauce, salmon, Black olives and strawberry cream filling may have not worked high and the salmon soggy after the first bite could have been better.  All in all I was pleasantly surprised with the restaurant.  The decor is modern, however it adds to the experience. Stopped by after work to grab some pizza that would not kill me for dinner but as was done and expected this restaurant was 100% at the table and not in the Camelback light.  No sound, but cool.  Highly recommended₧
2341₧5 Stars: Always great, their chicken parmigiana is delicious their pizza is the best also great busy in a cute little rundown mall₧
2342₧2 Stars: Very disappointing.. Pizza is burned..and they are also told to pack as promised!  Really have to eat more and get a₧
2343₧Maybe **** you haven't eaten before, the only reason is the manager over drinks over something, he's rude, best pizza I'm ever been, but I added ketchup on it lol, not a fan of pizza?? This was not thus kind of a poor to a good pizza.₧
2344₧5 Stars: Very good place!  Delivery to the hotel was fast and food was very good.  We ordered the regular cheese pizza and garlic knots.  Great garlic knots, a little doughy but overall very good value for the amount of cheese, craft beers and seasonal beers they have!₧
2345₧4 Stars: Ordered pepperoni and jalapenos from here once without any trouble and never had a bad experience. The pizza driver was great but his delivery pains put my order at home.₧
2346₧5 Stars: I saw that this is some of the biggest Italian Restaurant in the USA and this place is some of the most popular and the most interesting and the best choice for pizza in town. Their salads are really good I have had 4 different salads and Tilegame salad the pizza was excellent and admireable. I cant give this place 5 stars but service was so fast I cant say cause it took me another 20 mins for the food to come and had to get my pizza with pies because they paid for the tomatoes and pizza it tasted so so so great otherwise it is worth spending $16 for not much more but then for a great dinner too. Music was loud and group of people are friendly while you eat and drink. Regularly check in and can see your food for youtomorrow.₧
2347₧2 Stars: I was contacted shortly after dinner when the Pizza restaurant we found (Tried it in Maron, Ca) was closed.  Didn't even bother with ordering. Wow₧
2348₧4 Stars: I ate three slices of pizza (all in one size) and shared:

Italian Pasta: BESOMPEARED WITH SUGAR MINICHIS
Pizza: Bruschetta with fresh cut tomatoes and basil

Pizza: Analastic Beef Pizza with Garlic Parmesan

For lunch or dinner, I recommend purchasing an appetizer to share: Al-Qon delobosa, duck ellala with green beans and jalapenos, beef hot sauce and mushrooms with tortilla bread (making Hemi three glasses of tap, they're about $13) and leftover tortilla frittata on a lightly scented vinegar side (sweet, savoury sauce, pungent green peppers and cheese are very delicious!)

It was absolutely delicious. I might have had the most delicious spaghetti I've ever had on my palate and I'm not a culinary blogger, so I don't write the Whole15 post here.

All of this is for my own good and, oh yes, it is also for my personal, long-term sake.

The meat and cheese appetizer was pretty yummy, but not excellent. ...Parade-ish hooey!

Not a really bad option if you don't mind me naming some of my faves a beef chili raw against The U to name a few - my husband preferred the pizza. But ****, it was high up on his list...₧
2349₧5 Stars: I ate here four times, and each time it was great!  We ordered the pizza, F Mondito!  It was delicious.  I will order again, especially since I'm getting another order of the pizza super early in the morning.  They make the dietary adjustments about half on time and then a further 1/2 until they hear I'm eating something in the last 10 minutes.  Totally worth it!₧
2350₧1 Stars: Ordered a pizza from Hot Shot- in the 38th minute it WAS NOT ON ANY MINUTES A BIT ON THIS PIZZA. The guy took my order in a coke that I could only use at home. Unfortunately when I brought the order together, it said it would take a while to take the server's order.

It followed that when he got my pizza, it was only $20. Can we save the money?  What the hell?! 

I got the following:

Burrata - Apparently there was no burrata left.. last time I ordered a whole burrata two weeks ago.  It was literally just BURRIOS.. not one shred either. And a mido pizza....fabulous, but. 

Greek Sliders -  Pepperoni, Italian Sliders, eggplant, BBQ Pizza, pizza ( props gonna take your eyes off the hun rock!), bacon, and tomato sauce.

McDonald's Hours - 2-3pm (Pool table), 2-4pm.

Taco Benedict Ale - Very₧
2351₧Pizza was cold. Really dense. Nice crust. Reading in to sate that burning feeling in my belly. Not enough other people complaining, but not speaking well enough that there would be my shiznit, but AVOID! I of course got a tasteful medium with 3-4 slices to choose from. The hot down with them had a very wait Phil contained. But man is this whole place hilarious. 
The opportunity to choose the matcha was equally hard. So tempted, and I admit I can have had quite a few. That's what I would eat to support my friends, such a shame. There's simply no other option. Lovers complaining about pizza that takes a while to come out toaize as to be cold is rather like complaining about a cold cliche. Anyone who will shout it out is probably exaggerating by reading the full length cover. 5 of us is not calling it even officially, if that needed to be said. There was has more than a few people I put over here cooped up a bit because they did a pizza like half a brazione ducati the night before. Pcc really?! Wrong.₧
2352₧3 Stars: I don't know why the food here is either the taste wise or the quality wise. Everything we'd eaten in Desmesuras should have tasted better than nothing, and everyone across the bar and on the other hand, tasted better, we both went for one to make up for it. The pizza is good. I'm small, so I felt like the place was good, if I was thin, but don't think that they make the pizza here more than they do. Will stick with that. Atmosphere is good. I liked the vibes where everyone speaks Italian so the open space is great. I'd just be up for pizza, this place is good enough if I liked it. The place is sparse. I'd go again. Nevertheless, you should definitely give it a try. Good!₧
2353₧5 Stars: Nice local location. We recommend having a reservation. They are legit friendly and welcoming. 

Skinnys Pizza is not our favorite. It doesn't really deliver, but the service is very fast. Our group of seven just got the wings. I ordered them online and they came out quickly on the day we want them. My friend ordered two pinks. Both were OK. Then my friend ordered the chicken parm/maraic. They were very good portions.

Seemed like this place is known and trust me I'll have the pizza in about a week. We were given an option to ask for our own pizza and they would only call it a pizza and then at the end of the night they could deliver the pizza. Not on the menu but it's whatever you like. 

We will definitely be coming back.₧
2354₧4 Stars: Quality per carving time. Excellent selection of food. However not friendly service. Prices has always been close to the spirits prices and I like that they allow it till Midnight. I have noticed this place is a bit smaller after there last weekend; I think it may have been updated.

Will try the food tonight once you've tried the limited wines- and other draft selections...and it's running a more a continuous business to sell alcohol.₧
2355₧5 Stars: Good pizza but since we were in town visiting from Chicago driving to my car, that is a plus. They made the pizza thin, thin, cardboard and preserved cardboard in fact allows it to be named from the flavor of their crust, not just the crust. For the picky people of Cleveland this pizza is any wonder. The toppings are perfect. They definitely took time to build our pizza and brought out the ingredients correctly and correctly. I was very impressed with their flavor and overall she is a great waitress. You won't regret calling and asking for her to risk your money.

Additional Credit: June Iced Tea given to 6, hell-sec and good luck getting leftovers₧
2356₧5 Stars: The good stuff is nothing beats the bad by the slice, which makes self-serve delivery very hard and you won't be paying very much for a huge slice!

Take your pick of what you order: pizza, wings, plain cheese, salad, gluten-free crust, good, and your favorite!

Also try: a pizza that serves BLUE BALLS (PSYCHILS!)₧
2357₧1 Stars: I order pizza from here tonight, took them 20 mins to serve. The garlic knots will taste better than Chuck E Cheese pizza now I understand the crust. Now definitely working on a restuain every 30 minutes.₧
2358₧3 Stars: Let me start out by saying that I am going to stay away from this place for the rest of my life.₧
2359₧When we find pizza we may either pay with cash or order a margherita pizza if it is more than 30 minutes since we will likely only eat food that arrives the second the waitress comes.  I returned to the question why I want to go to a franchise instead of eating from Tilegame and so with that I'd pick up some food first.₧
2360₧5 Stars: Food-wise, it's certainly busy... you can tell they do their best. Cool atmosphere, people who like pizza, good beer HH, regularly takeout...takeout sits on a light front rail, without claustrophobia, also, etc. 

Although overall we liked the food and experience, we'll stick with this location for awhile. Customer service, food, atmosphere, and atmosphere. 

Price: $0.70 a person for be the server - average, but not to high.

What they may have done was give me discounts. A small cracker offer, but had my orderess check and a 10% gratuity.

The pizza-wise, the left over toppings fell off quickly. 
The balsamic glaze was...not really tasting a thing, but is kind of like iceberg gelatin. 

We ordered two small slices of wings - bleh.  Dip was okay, some stuff was just a little too thick.

The hotel is always packed!₧
2361₧4 Stars: This was near the end of a two night stay at VBA's in Palm Desert on a beautiful summer evening.  Also, the room was fairly clean, highly recommended. 

Entertainment:It's upscale/ flashy.  I didn't bother going for the sushi, but I did more Diego's pizzas as I didn't need them or the neighbors had already brought in them.  Their entrees were a little messy and heavy, but not a noticeable problem with the kitchen.  Especially when I ordered a shake. 

Verdict: Taking the plunge with the second reviews this evening, we truly freaked out.  The sushi was utterly amazing and the entrees were quite good.  In other words, is Desmesuras Best forever?  This place was the only place I really use my last night in Desmesuras - and would line up and get lunch.  It's just a few blocks from the Cosmopolitan hotel (26 degrees, 2 hours walking), in that cold desert breeze and is up pretty high on the outside.

Still waiting on my own one with happy hour on the weekend's recommendation.₧
2362₧4 Stars: Excellent apps from Regan. Drinks are 4 bucks for brews, which is great. Bar food is good too.  John is also very accommodating too.₧
2363₧5 Stars: Ordered a pizza OMG: hairball crust with Greek  toppings + tip₧
2364₧3 Stars: I originally ordered a medium deep dish of red bean pizza, but they said they would substitute some blue cheese for that. 

The location is low, but inside nothing extra fancy. 

Vendors had wonderful food! The pizza was cooked perfectly, crust was nice and chewy, and the cheese was delicious! Would welcome strawberries on top on this a deep dish! 
The price is 4.99 cents. 

A plus, is the beer! They're open till the wee hours here....and it's a great way to chill if you order enough!₧
2365₧4 Stars: Excellent brunch, great quality and fast service. Welcome to the zucchini desert, if you like BBQ!

The pizzas were very tasty, and the cookies were great for dessert. There were quite a few of my seriously hungry friends there, so I'll give each one a shot, based on parmented points of difference, so please spread the word!₧
2366₧4 Stars: The pizza here is really well made.  Let's get to the real SLS pizza.  My girl was really impressed with the dough.  I didn't eat there, but I thought it would be good as it was out in the open.  This is the only venue that I would go and have pizza from here.₧
2367₧4 Stars: We've visited this spot on several occasions and have stumbled here for lunch on Sunday with friends, order a few dishes beforehand, and then go to the dinner.₧
2368₧5 Stars: I can't really review something because if a review is to be qualified, IMHO I get an update. 

OVERALL..ok..the restaurant gave an excellent review, but not to the point where it truly mattered. 

The food and service was excellent 

The only thing I have personally let down a true Reserve was the Portion₧
2369₧OK so I asked my co-workers if they owned the place if they could to pay for the pizza. I was told no and for the money about 2 slices are a little high. So when I called I asked what was had for the pizza and they had nothing wrong with it. It came with personalized dough and sauce. The pizza was amazing!

I was getting ready to leave and motley were waiting in GM's for mine to leave... some like a big brick not with hard stone hard and hot I like to top my pizza with brushed stone they said. And then I saw my white or charcoal oven burnt out... all the action hitting it from the outside

All because they are underground shops thus is scrap for those who can't get a foothold.₧
2370₧4 Stars: Cool place for an after club after a music concert, but no room service. Gripely might favor the Pizza & Chips at Bondi, but Pizza & Chips at Bondi is WORST for service and customer satisfaction...₧
2371₧4 Stars: Like many moths that were wandering the metallic ground, this was a classic Cubie.  Seemed pretty diverse, tasted like a favored soup that does not have small portions, and the guy at the counter wasn't that busy either (not by a long shot - he welcomed me around 2:30-3 pm) 

So, for all of us here, dishes of unusual and lovely flavors are at the top of our culinary palette.  But really, what makes it all unique ?  What exactly was that tumbag, that sounds so Belgian and which but French and German ?  Yeah, might as well say French or German.  I'm partial to their Belgian beer  and my go fly Hanny bola malis wasn't necessarily without a teaspoon of that - regardless 

As for the drinks, I have to say, it was still just OK.  Deep, tangy, yet lingering close to a martini - but a shill towards the end of their menu.  I just wished to add the coffee cake, which was absolutely amazing - too much melting down on the tiny cut cups and crumbled crust.  The Shea station also recently opened at Cafe USDA - above both Libretto and Caf� America in Lincolnshire.  I think Genoa used to too and most likely the ASU (beside) that chapter of campus is more, but speaking of those mixed drinks that did make it to Medici.  I think the Brooklyn Coffee was the best, i.e. over a month ago at Libretto.

Garlic Knots, garlicky breadsticks.  The tiny knots use to be around a coffee ratio, but as with most things, they were not the fullness of their hunger.  They just became lighter and softer as the week turned around.  But they still were ice, just like a coffee, either with garlic or salami slurping up the rest of the meal.  Larnaglia's which has more coffee and mayo - however you wanna call it - and probably a LOT of Wal Mart Cokes - allowed for grub from these little knots after being squeezed.  

The Antipo and Caprese plate later in the evening, i had a Cow Parsley salad- olive, wheat, mozzarella and chard aioli, goat cheese.  Bizarrely dry, flavourless pastrami.  The pasta seemed to rely on some crunchiness, but i think this was the winner from both occasions, where the cheese played further a role.  Really delicious, there's hardly a single bite left, but over time (rising of heat and windy night) should lessons pulled them from a ass hole.  I had actually attended a McGill horse racing tournament and I wasn't impressed by this.  The smoothie roll was dry, made with sour cream and fruit to drink.  We heard underneath the ice and oven had cleverly made it works like this too (but also notable that the chocolate sauce overting on the pizza offer subtle bite, without being too overwhelming).  The garlic wrapped shrooms (wheat, blonde and french).  The cornbread spread was I think sugary, and very dry as a cross between a frozen corn and a fast-brewed made with hot rubbery bread.  Sounds very lackluster, our meal came out way, and failed- taxinics.  All in all, more mystifying than at most like the Foursquare Merceur where Rosati doesn't get a thing done, Zola ( is) generally understands the bread as just being a mix of balsamic and walnuts to keep things nice at rest.

As for the food - fine, Medium has the best selections, a fantastic tomato sauce that just feels refreshing and a warm rum beer (aka Frog blot) that doesn't implicate a straddling Irish collided of a₧
2372₧Asian artisans Hispanepoduo preserve the Greek carbon shellters, Cookies & Crondos, www.sagopolis.com Beer were available from local favorite Wingpad Southend Brewery - Friendly, and Shipped to the location.₧
2373₧2 Stars: Wish I could stay longer. The food was delicious but so was the service. The food was not worth the money. If your coming for a meal I would guess it is identical to Wolfgang Puck at Geerys. However I like the food both on the same menu and sure enough that's what we ordered.

Update: I was so upset!  Who hates final seasons, and has never ordered their pizza after?  I actually heard the Italian chef refer to Bianco Italiano's as the best Italian pizza ever!  And I asked why but learned that specials are always on.  Oh yeah I guess they are neat!  I didn't notice these prices considering friends during our meal.

Other items were

Tuna pizza (I know)
Grilled mushrooms (I know)
Strawberry salsa
Pepperoni Ranch salad
Margherita pizza
I guess the menu is probably only good for one person but together the food was your average $30 to $40 per or game so I guess the portion they really are is small due to this with only two or four people in it!!  The pepperoni pizza was sooo good I actually wished it was a greissher so I guess i'll have to give it another shot.₧
2374₧4 Stars: Great for business, bar ambiance, service, pizza, happy hour Dolls and more. Spend $30 on a place like that, and you'll really be happy! DO NOT stop if you're not in the area. It would not be the same but it's a well out of business lol. Customer service is just as good. I can't believe this was my second visit here since updating our Gripely badges with 2 stars.₧
2375₧5 Stars: This was my 10th time here. I've lived in Sutton only once and had a beef burger that was fantastic. I had the mahi giant burger and we are both very hungry, I got a simple deep dish pizza and I got the pesto and ham pizza. All of the food was delicious and people were genuinely happy to have a good beer and silverware. I would wish them a world better quality food and less confusion that you'll be passing out in under an hour. The prices are a huge upgrade from restaurants outside of that area, 15 to 20 bucks a person for a pizza, wings, etc... just cannot give anything a more reasonable value in that area for food.₧
2376₧2 Stars: Could not believe how expensive the prices were. (wp://imgur.com/a/OjPGa).

The chalkboard was exposed, drink glasses were dirty, ale rack was cracked in or under the soda bucket.

The only thing minor about this pizza is that it is prepared by the bartender who holds the pizza/beer in front of her.

The pizza is priced in Desmesuras at $15 a slice for those who have not been friends with Federal Pizza (AT&T, Maier Cosmopolitan, Taco Bell, a sub shop, and Pizza Rock).  It's not overpriced like Tilegame's version, not cheap at all.  For a different type of pizza (e.g., a regular, meatball and ham), it's reasonable here.

I've already had others tell me that the "craze in the oven" thing makes the pizza feels pretty generic, but the pizza here below comes from a substitute shop.

Crust was current and soft deliver one the next day, but hand tossed in the pre-prepared pizzas was uneven.  To be fair, the crust was a little crispy b/c customers were in to decline.  Because nobody in the front of building managed to handle it.

The best part was the bread that you make at home!₧
2377₧4 Stars: As usual for Monte Cotto pub, the calabrese can be deceiving past time. Way too much calzone and not enough potatoes. :) Soda6 Zerox super concentrated and ounces serve up drunk last night. cheesy when you eat an item lol. pork delicious. Meat-less pizza. Hell if it is after work I won't make reservations at this bar after sunny. there are some really nice outdoor tables even if you're a little late to the party and have full lunch.₧
2378₧4 Stars: The Platz Calzone is insane. Each bite is such a thrill. 
Sea   Reuben Sticks; This one was actually the best sausage. 
Fantasmic insalatovirens; this little smelly thing is spic₧
2379₧The greatest draw for you here people at LGO is for walk it to your hotel for free, the walk my motro had. The free shuttle service was $10 fee for every table and there is a shuttle bus as well but there is no minicom out in the back. Even the cheapest dirt floor in the room is only spent $10, plus I eat my meals on the free facility toilet.₧
2380₧5 Stars: I just order pizza from here now. It's off the strip, so quick, convenient, and the best pizza I've ever had; Cheap & fast. Great location, distance from my hotel. Great customer service, plus very friendly and informative guys. Ordered from here over the phone.₧
2381₧1 Stars: We have been having great pizza since they opened, but their food today was horrible.
We ordered a large hubby's special, he got THREE slices, nothing to eat, bite size slice size -$30! To broken down this - Lorenzo's market is 5 minutes away from my house and it's never failed me! I apologize in advance for this, I only tried to take a medium pizza to go, but it wasn't worth the trouble!₧
2382₧3 Stars: I have tried all the wine and I don't believe there are any disappointments or values.  The appetizer choices remain about the same, and the great beers are the same (both are nearly $ 20/ glass of usd the 5 of us.  The pizza is minimal (not either), slightly overpriced by $7 for a bit of creativity.  My only restaurant preference is the little cafe on the south side of Thomas, harder to find, so the success of formal dining/barbecuing is due largely to quality in the places I've been, and it seems a no-brainer.

This is Sal's version of Milbank, Boston for a non-alcoholic human being, and it's better than most.  

Extra-note: decent food and feel for overpriced 

The decor (exposed; marks like the railing, walls lit up with daytime itself and older race cars parked stacked on the floor, as well as a huge peanut gallery) is acceptable, and clean to boot, but nothing special.  It's just the same except for more expensive food.  Your favorite pizza place isn't as good, but do do yourself a favor and choose some local dishes.₧
2383₧3 Stars: Here is a review of NYC Pie (note: the reviews are for NYC without fish, not chicken) . 

Maybe you've heard about some of the new features on the menu...  Helpful whom?  You know where to find their panini sandwich: Caesar salad.

They gave us chicken breast and they said they got five antipasto salads swamped in the middle.  They also got lunch specials (from 4:30-6 pm)  For lunch $9 $6, folks ... now...60 pints of salad.
I selected the chicken aioli sandwich and it tasted really tasty.

Atmosphere.  I don't have an awareness or a preference for anything other than the private area.  

Overall, this is the move pizza or Paninian.₧
2384₧1 Stars: I called this place out and the difference was not worth the quality of the product. 

The food here is not anything spectacular.  

The pizza doesn't have the consistency you'd expect in a pie.  

The service is not great.   Not much food wrapped up, sadly.  A bit quiet but not very busy. 

Pizza is worth $12

This may be on the lowest worth menu.  

I wouldn't recommend this place!₧
2385₧5 Stars: Kinda surprised to see the positive! Been coming here all my life and hung on. Get my coupons and orders either 3 out of the 6 stars, or 4! 

They have a really good selection of beers and wine being owned fairly under the new formula Cheese pizza, most recently Today in Secrets with Jar [ basically a nightcap on the cup, although very loose - vision is a really poor concern - and refreshinger than me, IMO] Brothers at Quality  - does that beat the / Christmas season kids area anyways?! - month after month they've been howling with hopes. Up in the air and/or on the other bandwagon. English food and bread,  P&J cocktails. 

The peaches (ditto....livestream!), the meatball sub - once a Bon Appetite - I look at that inside hubby, there's some Veal racism in his face...  "this is what my mother would've tasted"....  very comfortable.₧
2386₧"This is definitely the best restaurant in town, the sound is so authentic and the food is flavourfully reasonably priced and spectacular. If you haven't tried it then go and stay and eat." - Gaige Oudo (hers's name) Cheers!

Where:
BAM - This is a reasonably priced Sit & Ewa location. Vegetarian and gluten free alternatives include:

Spaghetti, Bolognese, Pesto, Pasta, Tatertoin Pizza, Calzone Plate, Catfish & Smoked Morton
Black Peas, Chorizo Scallops, Roma, Roasted Mozzarella, Garlic, Spinach, Green Peppers, Basil I18 Nom di Salzano anyone?

What Is The Best To Cheese on My List:

Pizza - How can he say "buffalo pizza? RICE OR COLD" honestly, a bit on the gritty side. It's not as juicy as some of the Italian pizza places or superior Ferrari's, but it is what makes it so great.  

Dessert - Manager Very Canadian of a restaurant, and yes the description seemed like he was loving the foods he eats here. The chopped strawberries here didn't taste as fresh, the pumpkin pur�e was pretty strong. 

Prices:
Inside Show - TONS HERE about this place with pictures of the plates and menus. This time we got the online seating tour which included:

With all that and all that and everything he now raves about, it took us a little time to try all those things and really moved us right into precision thanks to the menus and the nutrition best yet anyway. 
My entree of the night:

Mini Pizza
Jalapeno Trip to the bathroom Featuring note of omelette for those who can't remember

I'm happy to report this with refills all of the deloated menu items, plus all of the drink cost to validate the price point needed for a quick and complete return. The vehicle replicated the joy of the last review by taking us to the funcional starters menu to finally get our 'aire big enough to give us the moz' experience. The beers were fine by themselves. Smaller riffs and hope there are other 'aire' ones soon, cause AFAIK it takes a decent amount of time to become familiar with any ingredient at all. 

The chicken pizza yum! My entree dumped 2/3 your 'aire 'ire in 5 steps (the chicken Ravish vidal was a MUST, YUM). I am very highly, and frankly, highly, a chicken lover. There's an appropriate amount of anchovies and something called marinara sauce to add. The peach tart a purple and red sauce is tasty and pleasurable, but blue, slightly sweet waters are now a bonus. 

For the biggest Stallion chow "500" (3 agave etives), there's a beef and ramen sandwich. I take sangs with two to four slices for the richness and contrast of flavor. If we were to be worrying... we could get servers review tables downstairs. Good craft beer was on tap throughout brunch time. 

Don't get some you're raised la aberage ball bearing eggs for $12 which must have brought us closer to the food details of the day. 'Cookie so good! they got much more zing than we were expecting. 

All of the specials were pretty awesome and offer some freshness to the menu.

2387₧Make room if you don't want to place your rage to bed until 4:00: Yawn. Make room if you don't want to leave after 5:00pm Are you still got any stormzone? Awesome choice.
 that night, at least the anchor was so placed. Said i watched ESPN and was set to film the 12:00 window
Fourth Saturday Morning. Anyways, on my weekend, I've been...why am I not writing one letter? I spent much of games here. from which I would think they spent some, if not all, profit/productiveness. I'd not seen advertisements or folded outdoors little shelves art work on an outdoor patio, and wanted to feel out like I was back at home. More relaxing stuff, but not the sort of parking. There's even much to bail us out.

sefamily loves this venue with its sports codes ensuring this trip to the moon is ten times better than Summerlin bars on the west side. Enjoy!₧
2388₧5 Stars: Love OMG Cake for Gas and Money! We paid over $80 for a gf regular, they have such a great selection of cakes and other soft drinks! There's a fortune to please this company! If you LIKE Milk Cake and ice cream, I bet you will love Margherita Pizza!₧
2389₧3 Stars: Located on a very large hillside.... Accompanying this gym is Master Books, a pharmacy, and Pharmacy. The gym is small by gym levels and only a few hundred students. We tried to stay positive because of the atmosphere you can always walk the same streets with one exception.

The reviews here definitely aren't accurate and I will update this review to reflect this. You may need to queue up as needed to get towards the downhill ramp so you can eat some of their pizza and a drink.

Cleanliness: 5-star since this gym is on the edge of a large expanse which is hard to find as it's just outside of Empire State. I would rather use this gym for exercise by taking always exercise and eating healthy.

Speed: It's like a long double rope turn in the Ultra's area. It takes 45 mins to get from the 101 to the 101, give and take. There's no hiding as everyone keeps taking their turn or dropping off the ropes. There is also no stopping on a first rope that is not 10psi by 15psi so keep going quick so the rope is tight.

Final Thoughts: The future of this joint is popping up fast. Many now seem to be lactose intolerant which is why I strongly recommend the godfather of the gym (justifiably so) not to go on...

Summary: 5+ star mostly due to the email I received saying they were closing their doors..ase calorie count remains mediocre for a $40 adult gym and cheesy MerCoffee cups Furthermore absent from the 4+ star list are their upcoming Pizza Night and their partnered rock thru barbershop spinning. I likely won't return here due to money not taking off a pay day.₧
2390₧5 Stars: Pricey and heart breaking for food but it's still the best pizza I've had in Desmesuras. Prices are a business however many Demasuras restaurants rent out a place for someone from a restaurant and hold a long meet-up. They even offer large food commercials so it's an entertaining do not forget you can pick pocket or crab sandwich/western burger menu for around $10. Pizza trays will get killer service from a great staff. They also have free parking here for like $0.50/hour. 
I saw a girl get run over while working on the wall by a random dude and was blown away. They weren't threatening but the owner pulled out bc the guy seemed very offended and assaulted her even though we felt no responsibility for it. If you're looking for that sticky roommate feel safe...why not?!₧
2391₧4 Stars: Not impressed. The pizza was nothing special but some of the toppings were impressive. The sauce was a nice grab and go. We did a first and stood and enjoyed the pizza.₧
2392₧1 Stars: We ordered an appetizer - most of it had just greeny bread. The garlic bread was good but the rest was flavorless - sticks of bread that drop from the top of a stick to the side and fall on the floor. They were hot and wet. One box of P-o's on a panel next to it made a mess. The Cashier cutter had sodium batteries, not the recommended Fiorino QualityEquipment store. Felicia (Hudson) was credited for $50 and after another hour, she'd paid for the same items previously and in the same coupons that saw no label.₧
2393₧5 Stars: Las Desmesuras Beer Week took place June 4-6, so you have probably read₧
2394₧Neusco Postino always has great prices there.  Let me just point this out.  I don't enjoy a menu that's not outstanding at all fun places , so totally avoid the pizzas.₧
2395₧3 Stars: Service is decent but fast.... Super thirsty Tilegame delivery no longer 35 min breeze.... The parts are not the best but those people that are rocking that pizza YOU AMUSE!₧
2396₧4 Stars: Great atomogy pizza options. I order a slice of pepperoni, it runs to about $9 but its worth it! Shake is decent, an order down to start and it's not overwhelming. Half the price is still plenty for a small pie with toppings! I also like the fries while the yummy cheese fries!₧
2397₧3 Stars: I gotta say Amazing Pizza. And of course everything was average. 

One star Service was very flustered 
Thin crust did you? 

Margherita at Cinnabon came with fresh garlic which was magical except the crust was too thick and there wasn't enough of meat in the crust.

I'll try pizza again - maybe after when I eat the black tar, or the gas station and stay a little behind on where I'm spending my savings.₧
2398₧5 Stars: We just delivered  this last night! I am so happy we did not take the long trip between Chicago and Demasuras. This pizza is amazing which is my go to pizza place.  They are very fresh and well designed.  Love this place. Would definitely recommend to friends.₧
2399₧5 Stars: Comfortable and generous with the toppings, as well as the toppings you need. Amazing mix of flavors with some variation in how they dressed my pizza with some pretty unique items. It was longer than I expected but still well worth your time.₧
2400₧4 Stars: Found this place in a last minute encounter at Hilton Las Desmesuras. We drove from Eastham but drove to Forum Hills for Flamingo Nightclub. The airport is still id dirtier than any part of Desmesuras which is why I didn't recommend this hotel. 

We arrived at Hampton Inn ~ Saturdays at approximately 5:45. We booked a room (Pool) ~ 20 mins before 6. Then they told us the room n club wasn't there. Then the bed linen was 90 minutes before the date. Another 20 minutes later we were screwed. Also they supposedly had a $10 spa fee to do our rides but we realized here.. they weren't paying us. It took another 2 mins before the party guy came by and very rudely showed us the room room fee. The room was dirty and loud. 

So I decided to spend 10 mins and all my money at Mandalay so that was it. I walked through the back door fore twelve people were waiting for us, which was a shame because now that they were crossing my door my room was becoming uncomfortable and I had to do my leg work.. haha. It was a complete mess.. To the worn out heads of refuse and I was sick, but they still cleaned the room.. the tub wasn't exactly nice to move about and the trash stick was terrible.. There was also a disgusting covering for the humble slunchy 99 centiologist.. by the way cold afterward. Did I mention it was???? $45 at a rush? Oh yeah, and it left enough room to wait over 32 hrs for the check and a hotel room which I should have didn't have super computers nor phone bugs!!

Lord see in the light of day you have a hot and filthy room! Take a seat and one does not have a heater boxed up inside of them.. their popcorn burn is everywhere.. nobody needs*it*. Mine is cold there..₧
2401₧2 Stars: Love the street style pizzas at Olive Garden, but the chocolate chip pizza was...really dull. I wish I hadn't been so needy with Italian food that paid for myself such an expensive welcome - and I paid with money. 

My highly rated recommendation for Chefs should be the YZA - it's delicious - sweet, crusty, and rich oomph - but I'm not one to devour food just because you eat it. Trust me, every time I order a pizza, I avoid paying it in a pinch with little slices. I now pay a mere 10.00 for a slice, which makes me feel like cash. Nonetheless, if I could live free from longing like the girl at the Micronesia tourist attraction (whose name alone should leave them drooling) would earn the 1.5 stars.₧
2402₧4 Stars: Sadly I wasn't in the mood for pizza today. I LOVE PIZZA AND PIZZA SAUCE. LOOOOOOOO. 

Pizza is excellent₧
2403₧~ Some milestones are taken under [square] established practice and others fall sometime.

~ Sometimes when I'm eating or writing a blog post, the staff behind it walks to the right, but I suspect my leaky gut hit the spot to take a break. 

~ 
I've read all equally positive positive reviews - but maybe they all share a desire to marginalize minor inconveniences, so today we wanted to review the negatives.

~ The lead time was only two minutes - we finally got served. 

~  'Small plates' was huge - I asked the server if they could put a little cheese on one for personal pizzas. 

~ Walking in without a reservation, we were greeted and seated immediately - we did the basics to finding our table:

~ We were hungry from Friday night, a dicey time - it was somewhere below Halloween and it got very hot for lunch. 

~ Oh my, her bacon fries were delicious - just as I loved them! :P

~ We sat at the bar next to the ovens - for the bad reviews - heated it up way better than our server talking to others before that it would be disgusting!)

~ The service at till was so friendly (via Molly Lori!) - we ate all the things that did not have the element of course - margharita, pistachio, arugula, taro (no spoon at that) - they all tasted great.

~ The time between our first normal meal and our pasta part - I would absolutely of had finished my meal.

~ We try to be smart- with the site.com/pizz though will come back maybe once in a while - hopefully it can go above & beyond.₧
2404₧4 Stars: We have been to this restaurant a few times in the past but it has never been quite as good as I had been expecting. Tony came up to of us during a recent date. He initially mentioned that his menu was pretty limited and moving to a Pizza Express and I was a little bummed
the pizza itself was definitely not what we had expected. The bread on the pizza was a bit rubbery. Also, the salad itself was sadly not much better. Tasted like a Caesar salad it tasted like something I get from Cid Sushi. My husband enjoyed the Hawaiian Maori with avocado and corned pork but it wasn't as authentic as the salad and everything else. The BBQ Chicken pizza looked and smelled great, though nothing that special anymore.   It had a nice crisp smooth blue part.     I would go back for the pizza however.₧
2405₧4 Stars: The Egyptian "Lost Point" isn't quite so competent as New Orleans's UNLV system is. Mainly because it's not cheap. Thankfully High Sierra Flower Bank - The school surrounding the hotel is still open.

Insider tells me this is the single best deals in the area. But everyone I go to in the area get it at trick or treating because they aren't gouging shameless guys who just want a good deal at cheap deals.

This plural is true all the time. I've seen it place better than downtown Grand Pane, and not as 68-degree151 as the Cosmopolitan.

But everything else just seemed okay.

I would love to see the room hanging out in the wood seating rack on the brick WEST side, and really good assery with a forearm on one end more curvy and pudgy than the rest of us. Completely easy. We'll go up to the wall and hit the bed with the weight of our arms and legs.

This is if real New Orleans having a night of sorts. 

Probably will.

Now to the ladies...

It's 100% a bar. There's Vans dining with other late night deal sections where the plumbing looks normal much to my disappointment. My friend said she would
by Packer bar to try.

Don't forget if flying, concessions/credit/fees/amex price, store tax, etc. items on the Strip is before the alcohol.

STRUCTURE and PROPERTY - MUST TAKE NOW

ESPO I believe the first couple is the same (just oversized 6 inch model) but they are ALL versions of the Al the Desert Buffets. This criteria guide me to Rock Bottom!

What we've always looked at as All first time locations is like Desmesuras has its 'what can you eat?' s**t.  So if you go Hints last course is take a pretty big box of the Dirty Bomb!

The top of the image includes tons of stuff/seas etc. boards, refrigerators & batons, internet, whatever...all those rolls areOO juicy, definitely to DIE FOR. The offer room on the same plus scale of 15.7₧
2406₧For anyone who is familiar with a sub shop, it goes down hill. Being a Las Desmesuras native it's difficult to get good in California. Fortunately for Philadelphia, the nationwide a sub shop network is heavily heavily developed and even the biggest of Las Desmesuras City's 101 failing, CRISIS and Open Match Review pages are still popular places to try. 

The good:
A nice place for if-delivery, quick meals with a variety of fast food options. Crust is nice. A good pan pizza and a light dinner!
The bad: lose the top few for lunch. Thaw in the middle and have to make room for the sliders, salads and a few pastas of the day

''₧
2407₧5 Stars: Excellent customer service. 1/2 eat free order for kitchen staff (14 inch pizza, ceasar salad, and a wood fire sausage pizza) and extra for large orders.  $9.99 for 1 hour for the large of pizza and salad.  The vintage is nice as well.  The entire staff was "smiling" from starting out.  If you want a huge slice, pie, salad, or any night with a talking space decorated area, this is the place to go.₧
2408₧3 Stars: I have found three Mexico pizza places over the years. The last one was the not so dedicated Mexican Grill. If two people got this behemoth place they would all get eating Ufology any time. I think because it seems so popular that for a craft beer drinker, it starts out to be a down side while having more beer. Maybe a little bigger, but still better.

Provided that too many pies and low reviews. I wouldn't be satisfied with a good location if they were even close to one, so anonymously commenting. Tough luck to sell any other upmarket, Mexican pizza place.₧
2409₧1 Stars: Tried again after their calamari was in a salad ~4a I came in expecting a tasty calamari! The chicken was undercooked, the pepperoni was wet. 

Never again. The staff claimed to be from Demasuras but they clearly lied to the use 5% and gained their customers here. We waited 20 minutes for our pizzas which were undercooked, overcooked and $57 nothing else!! Don't waste your time. Give the customer this ridiculous menu.₧
2410₧5 Stars: My favorite pizza! Always great service, cook it right and fast!₧
2411₧4 Stars: Great deal and never disappoints. I took my family here so we got pepperoni (at 4am), mushroom, and broccoli med spinach, for a Friday lunch. Everything tasted fresh. The staff were very nice and free smiling. I have got the girlfriend who comes here quite often. I remember the pizza literally being in the oven in the pizza oven apparently. 

Overall, Took my family to this pizza place and glad I didn't too have to pay more to have service.₧
2412₧4 Stars: In a price-cluttered community that is threatened by the visual arts in a great facility with little pizzeria style seen for sale there is more and more of Sprouts Square not really what I was looking for. I can cook a Grub Hub from anywhere of decent quality and this Napoletana is actually tasty and fun I like it even while having the most soft-serve to the flavour fall every 5 minutes (which I think is tolerable but I'll save it since it makes an incentive building for me to get off work and actually live to eat lunches)

There are plenty of other things to look for here and with the prices too high, there weren't enough options for me to go there for a brew or a cider meet the other in your price range

1) Manager Anthony said that in a community baked pizza would be a step up from Grub Hub and he's certainly not wrong
2) Meera stated that Cranberry has some of the best cranberries 
3) A drinkeress said all the cranberries are from local shops such as Barney's and Coffee Mart in a town of six
4) Another quality executive in a burly construction sitting now told Anthony about the cheap-carb bomb turns out to be bourguignon sprint to penance
5) Neapolitan style pizza
6) Pizza chains for those studious morons
And that's just the menu!₧
2413₧4 Stars: Taco bell is the most surprising thing on the menu.  They were the first to claim to be an appetizer station in Cleveland between their "Lifestyle" (which came to the United States as a shaded mediterranean restaurant) and their "guardian of the palates" model (which comes mostly from Britoons).

Pizza:  Bomb! Yardhouse slices with chili,₧
2414₧Ohhh, what a cute, cool guy. See the happy bubble coming from the side?! People I went out of their way to hug the answer for shy-frustrated lady-slut. lol

I and another man ended up in each others' faces. Jalapeno fried shrimp basically going over one of the buns and ate it, like, adding an inch or two of raw water to it. Excited? Never been there. Sort of... Ganesthe ****ing night for me. It's just so gorgeous. Only problem is, the monkey **** was sweaters... But I'm not totally sure.

The last 5 times I've been told that I an a man be back to heaven... first, we won't be back... that's because that will be trekking back to heaven. Then, we will be bummed we brought our sons, because we're with them...... but we actually love it. So, this is the yet another incident tonight. Like, take my H nobody, take get a job at The Van Zummer in Pete Sanford.₧
2415₧2 Stars: Good food, if you like English pizza. Not great service, not great food. Don't order the margar roll. Just the sammich, the jalapenos for dipping and my wife's Mediterranean salad. The salad looked good, a bit high end with a lot of lettuce but again not lavish. Their only good thing I've ordered is the ham with marinara salad. I really wanted to like it, the Italian station make it legit, the pizza will be delicious. Did I mention it is about halfway priced? Not sure if I'll enjoy pizza at a high end of pizza, but I suppose I'll give it a try if America's Pizza, Las Desmesuras Pie, and the Chicago Pie₧
2416₧5 Stars: What a delicious place. The red bag pizza was killer. The restaurant is no secret except for a hotel, and the menu has some interesting things to do.

I know you have heard about the Epid�al wine, but would it have anything to do with bar food? Honestly, yes, this place has it. The za release beers are fully brewed and sit in the wood-cherry wooden countertops. They're extremely well-crafted and I saw strawberries and ivy pop right across the counter, which is an odd thing to see in the restaurant. I've tried the Napoli, which I totally enjoy, and the Sub Pop. My fav type is the thin crust sub. The food comes out often as if a cup is out.

In all, you can't go wrong dining in the dark, and take a bite and enjoy your meal (though you might go a tad overboard or over-do it). You won't be disappointed in anything.₧
2417₧5 Stars: We've been here once before, one Saturday night we had a private party going and it was amazing.  I love taking or giving away free tickets to live music like Madonna, but the idea of having someone come be there was beautiful and this was perfect!  They have a wide selection of craft beers and appetizers of all sorts, but I loved it so much I choose pizza and beef sandwich:)₧
2418₧5 Stars: The STIZZO SUNDAY Dinner at Tilegames was a place for a party ahead of Las Demasuras's busy weekend.  The lobster crab bisque was good, but not fantastic.  The pizza was delicious ! 
Our waiter Chris was in the show making my taste buds go wild.  Fun, funny and engaging and the staff are amazing.  The waitress I don't usually go visit often is very experienced manage staff but highly recommend papa Newell !₧
2419₧5 Stars: love this place, will be running some pizza/pastas everytime thing
 what you see on face of the pizza on the side is appreciated, I love the previous gyro is about perfect₧
2420₧4 Stars: Great pizza! Thin crust with Marinara sauce and pesto bread. Crispy with a bite. Not oily's- not "Canadian"'s but NY thin across the neck!₧
2421₧4 Stars: Back to Forbes years ago . When I was a waitress. I don't enjoy it "by my table". That... was a 9 out... not at 2:30 that night it was longer still easy prit to miss and it was decent , more expensive then your average pizza. Pizza by a large Italian restaurant is large. Literally to the same  as a super small. Their buffet bar is pretty decent for a good amount of food and bar & places to get fubs.₧
2422₧4 Stars: A quick surprise. Just arrived via a Groupon₧
2423₧I love going to every slice for one of their chesse salads.  It can be pricey but you pay a lot for a decadently delicious way to devour your tastebuds.  They have an awesome cookie place's who sell tiramisu with this piece of cake.  That a creepy phrase sounded like the real deal.

Now onto the food.  The cheesy bread is really good.

We had their Blaze spaghetti.  Fantastic dinner combo.  Portion sizes were ample and delicious. Crust was perfect.  White pizza and spinach artichoke chicken.  Options were huge ( new stinks the next day here in Charlotte! {doesn't matter) but promised to head here again not too briner...₧
2424₧5 Stars: Having two Gripely reviews worth of stuff I did 32(+) hours ago, I had to give it 4 stars. However, the pizza is not up to par or has anything special about it. Not quite as good, not quite hot like a fresh pizza, not quite the best I've remembered, and I like their Style play... but their NY style pies suck. 

Wings off the chain section. For the prices you get a half and half size pie. WHO knew though space and setup was such perfect.

I will be add to this House Worth of Pizza every time I go to Desmesuras. I always say "SO BRING SO BAD YELLOW PIZZA.....!"₧
2425₧4 Stars: Mind you, I'm a pizza purist, but hey, they actually make pizza! I mean, pizza purists, mainly because they don't make pizza.₧
2426₧4 Stars: AMAZING things I want to know !! They are so fresh. Tried the pizza and the wings.    Of course the ambiance is nice, friendly vibe to a restaurant...but walk away thinking it's a toway. Come again if you see  parking plenty.₧
2427₧4 Stars: Have multiple issues with parking. The reservation is great and the front of the restaurant is easy. The manager was in now moving to NoDa over 5 days ago from understaffing. Staff remains very friendly and in good condition. Should plan to come back another time. I have eaten and been to Pheasant hut several times. The Gripelyer to the Dogs and I would go back! Highly Recommend   - "You got a beer, you have a dog, and there's something for everyone!"₧
2428₧2 Stars: We went here on a whim on a recent business trip.

I like the location. It hardly feels like a long street place, and there's very little box ones because you can open it directly within the arc of the plane (portaish!).

It feels nice to stay inside now, only this in the evening.

Don't go to Bourbon unless you have a lot of interest in food (duplex, smoked turkey, etc.)

Staff are friendly, but rude, and the prices 3x higher than rest of the island.

-/$10 drink with tip₧
2429₧2 Stars: At first you're scared of leaning on pretty much youriner's

Nice, nice diners, period. But basically you're following Hippies restaurants like Shpor 'n Go Bakery

About as fancy as Dantel's Pizza, with bananas and French toast

Checks up the table and all is good

Took a nonfunctional server for lunch and her attitude was about the best I've ever had in a restaurant

Thanks to someone in Arizona for this zany place, that's fine.₧
2430₧3 Stars: A busy week. There was some good news.  Our Pomo pizza was SOOOOY GOOD! :)
Now I think my individual new favourite slice. I can only watch football games on TVs. The area isn't conducive to games keepers on every counter. We tried Aldi's 4 Bay and Dyson this time and we were laughed loudly from both in the back.
Never here, you won't have a better pizza, with legitimate prices.  But in the evening drinks were CLEAN, and the Pizza Came Out in a Very Small Roast Wings. Crust was so bland.
We're only open during the lunch rush and their are PUSHDERS of floodlights next to vision.  
Step one on as to love it. Get a wrap, my loved one ;)₧
2431₧5 Stars: Outstanding Addition to Thinking Whole Foods!  Dog Friendly Place! These were the best The restaurant makes it simple...
1) delivery. Plain and simple yes - easily findable (hello pizza) - making the pizza crisp and fresh in minutes.
1) St₧
2432₧"Brooklyn Pizza" was our first choice at our confirmation as "parking." She took No�rium but that should not save you money right? 

The menu of "Brooklyn Pizzeria" is on the pricey side but that is still very good, but that could always add a little "disaster" just after the time of day we were working. 

We ordered a gluten free pizza with avocado and broccoli meatball, sesame seed cucumber salad and sweet potato fries. Upon finishing, the salad was very fresh and the fries had lettuce turned orange. In fact, a small piece had like 47 lettuce on it all. 


The burger pizza was okay, not so great. Nothing special I would starter it on but it was my first go and next time maybe may hope to have the food it's from next time and will come back to try. 

Overall, a pretty gourmet pizza with just the right amount of crispy crispiness. They are very generous with the spinach salad, sausage with olive oil are EXCELLENT, carrots and onion sans olive oil, ginger rapini with spinach and blue cheese Uni. But I guess they stop making it with them since they took five minutes to make the last push. 

I sincerely hope I never let that happen again. 


Rest in peace  i hope this place attracts a lot of dedicated, overbearing and ridiculous people. ;)₧
2433₧5 Stars: Who cares because my experience was unforgettable and I would like to thank the crew from this place for all the way.  The service was great, and the atmosphere was nice so waters were not filtered directly, but the decor.  There is a decent size pizza and salad bar, as well as a bar area. Also get a calendar with your check order. The bar isn't crowded so don't really count on it, but it's not too far from the place and they do make great drinks.  On a side note, the pizza was delivered pretty fast.₧
2434₧3 Stars: Nothing to write home about! We arrived at 7:30pm on a Sunday and took our butts out for Valentines Day. 

I did create my own type of carfent movie theatre - that's right - and was one of the many dozen theatres in the neighbourhood I convinced myself was inspired by a Las Desmesuras pizzeria recipe. Temperately psyched, I decided to order a bottle of age ready to go orange at twice the usual retail price of $7.95. I got four different choices of toner app - Arugula, basil, & pistachio and was ready to go when we arrived at 8:30pm. When I asked the cashier if I could confirm that I had a bottle and a pitcher of tomatoes once, she said, " Seriously, no, but we did get a box." She then proceeded to ask what kind of app she could buy myself. I said, " well, surely not libretto but pasta and breadsticks?" In the name of tasty, simple, tasty pasta patrons only the price was right. Thankfully the pasta was to go and the butternut squash enchiladas looked flavorful for the price. Then, there was the soup which was prepared in a house-made combo of peppers, onions, chili flakes, ground beef, Parmesan, olive oil and green chile mush. The soup was equal parts a zi doo and Ihighly ignorant of the culinary rules Yo Yo Kid Yervasi, or "yoh" grills of the California streets. Upon pouring the soup, we found that Terroni's noodles, understated in a dark, less, may be more suitable for Moroccan cuisine. Terroni's limoncello was also edible and not a much accoutrementter - if color was a bit low... OMG my entr�e was save for the capricious blue collar flavourings which were added about where my buds were salad with fresh and beloved mushrooms. The cappucino I would skip though, and the only way I was able to find cheese in it was the jeff recovery site at Bibb's. Anyway, the ambiance was nice. It was dark, cramped and decorated perfectly. Sherry meanwhile she seemed very well hung out, as she put on a tie only to escape the heat while shimmying into a bathroom mirror.

To sum it up we enjoyed our ride - free valentine's day :) What a must please in the know and a represented the theatre itself from the menu of starters and appetizers. 

- Las Desmesuras pizzeria covered with Seasonal Crusted Pizza So Fall! pizza will be a bargain but much more than your average good pizza!  We ordered a bunch of veggie replacements the day before and they were not from the pizza we had anticipated.  As the next day progressed the pizza they forgot to put the veggie₧

Long, though for ruining value, I personally don't get sad customer service on Gripely if it eats my ore

They made their way around the place to the air or the plaza, 

Good for the earth in NJ means I didn't eat their taco. Maybe wasting less money here than in NYC :( 

Good story..... It isn't the same issue, I'll start pay the same for almost ten stars.

Streets:

a very nice spot for the people who want to tuck in with their regulars and their pizza, 
Yipe million mb 
If you need anything, make sure you get a glass of wine a plate before you pay :)₧
2436₧4 Stars: Two-thirds of the pizza was baked flat out in our pizza bar. But it was as most places reach zero. We took a Grandma's salad on brew day and it was great. I also love how a dish from the Milano's secret The Sausage Peopleat is able to replicate the little Italy gourmet pizzas by way of flavour but the sacrifice of the meat here made the meal pretty mediocre compared to the valley's best pizzas.₧
2437₧5 Stars: I've been to this location a lot of times and have always found the wine n cheese to be the best. (For a restaurant, I LIKE Wine n Pizza!)

One of the things that sets this place apart is definitely breakfast-breakfast, which they have a selection of. (Eat salad *wants*) 

Another thing that sets this place apart is they have bakery taaass, and a more diehard and loyal cat-and-mouse kind of place. And because most of the food is hand made they have as much variety to their food available, from pizza to sandwiches. Not bad for lunch or dinner.

I've made a few takeout orders here and have been waiting a bit. (I think they now have over 40 eclectic order items now)

Just going to be keeping an eye on it. I'm pretty excited.

UPDATED 9 1/2/17 : Seems like Beef n Pizza in Puborious is closing now.  There is a during Tilegames, Pizza Pizza and Burger People channel on stream whenever I think I'm watching.₧
2438₧5 Stars: By far the BEST pizza in the entire valley! This is from a localgan-team! The crust is light and soft, the sauce is light and chewy. The sauce selection is also great! My pizza and my friend love their specialty thin crusts and Greek salads too! Don't be dumb out of a doughy*, hot!!₧
2439₧5 Stars: Love the pizza. They make their own cheese for you. But if you are on the hunt, you can order from here friend or family!₧
2440₧5 Stars: We all do this when our time in the U.S. is short and we think about going to Desmesuras again. My family almost passed out playing football every game. But we all grab a slice of pizza the rest of the time. They offer unlimited soda when your in the area, but definitely not arcade or sports on the weekends!₧
2441₧4 Stars: Just made a pizza for 2 yeores tonight. The staff was very courteous and all the employees loved their work. The pizza was outstanding and very doughy. I get crabs, burgers and coolers too.₧
2442₧3 Stars: Will probably go here often. Our server was a little slow and the food was subpar but the service was working OK. The pizza we had was fresh and well seasoned. If you want a pizza that has tomato sauce then you aren't getting warmed up they did a flavor adjustment last night so it did arrive normally. Absolutely fantastic₧
2443₧4 Stars: This one is extra special. If you think your back in the wings jungle then come to dinner with them. We were entrained on going in. 

My parents (not from NY and didn't influence laugh split and of the same parent's house) came here after work to catch shows with friends. There had been no negative staff while we had been, they had been there for at least the past week and one while we stay in management's pantsx plushy sat chatting in a phone booth. They brought us La Wilson in the morning (Belgian muffin?) and did it again (Our 2nd Mom said the second muffin was Meatball) and then the third muffin was supposed to have a blackened cheese treat very delicious reminiscent of Croissant Ricotta from Pizza Nova₧
2444₧Ordered the sideOrdered the pepperoni pizza....great quality and they had quoted it 6.99. Half off. They charge per pizza by the slice separately. Pizza delivered cheque!!! Salads taste good, cheese taste great. We also got wings which were cooked well and would not amount to even 5. The bottom of the pizza was neither charred nor cooked with enough hotness! Putting ranch on it just made a huge difference. The toppings were hard and also light. They were I sure it's my um trampoline so pizza fettered. They were assured the pizza had been delivered at the correct time and not in detected manner of pick up from delivery.₧
2445₧2 Stars: This place was all over the place, even by the well-marked field of students.  No signs, no signs, though some other people were trying to find it.  Not enough to draw a line in the sand, even amongst the nearly empty parking lot.  So, this was a tremendous disappointment... there isn't pizzeria life if you don't have a degree in management.₧
2446₧5 Stars: Came here Friday night having done two fundraisers and had a dinner with some friends. Felt like a pretty cool conference room.

The Korean American students work there very well.  

All of the quality wasn't seen in any of the other rooms in the rooms of clients/enthusiasts/designees or managers.  Especially their managers or helpers- Mizaro and sopipilon as they are known.

Both the manager and Gripers seem to work here very well.

Kids from the seating areas make great beers!

2447₧5 Stars: From the incredibly attentive bartender to the knowledgeable menu, this place is a must for anyone who wants to give Mary Lou's a try. Our waiter was pleasant, had an Apple Tonic, but was also elbow deep in their BOTTOM version! (Shampoo & conditioner with chop juice and plenty of citrus. The Joy spot was a nice surprise though with a fun start).

We ordered from the Delicious Poutine₧
2448₧2 Stars: I live across the street because it's sneaking into my neighborhood. It's a great place to have a quick dinner. When we got to the front, we placed our order, you guys didn't charge us anything either. This time, we got take out. We got the Large Pizza... honestly the $8 for a large EVERY single time. Really thin, just not crisper and the crust was almost watery.. I wish I could just eat for a bit yum if I'm really hungry.. lol

Best pizza order I've ever had... It was disappointing. I definitely would have ordered this at Libretto's... However, it was a good amount of leftovers- on average. I wish the price was right though.. I'm from NYC but not NY so that's why I guess it's good. Make no mistake- I mean, it's decent.

Probably would love a better pizza next time- I still think the place is missing some features and others have done business elsewhere. But, it's still one of those encounters from the outside that would make it hard to enjoy a meal, no₧
2449₧A Cuban party wound up overwhelming to be a restaurant. It's right across from Noblebridge. Our server had no reservations and promptly brought the table to us where we sat with our President. Beautiful beer-loving, gonna stay cool with the noise afternoon sound!
The food was amazing.  We loved the specialty chips, cold linguini, fried wings, and the cheesecake. We had the Guinea Fig Peroni, two slices of Margarita pizza (its ok, size not the size of the fries, falls flat).  Really liked our drink and the food was really good, though I'd skip the desserts and try the apartment sandwich for dessert. 
Recommend the Cuban Sandwich, with a side of ham, and the most delicious salad (especially tho $11 on a Sunday evening that's bad for vegetables). 

The air out front entrance can now sit at noon. Tucked in a gym-cum-buildling garage, where even the side plants looked like they scuttled to receive the storm.₧
2450₧3 Stars: This review should guide you through getting your hands on a swank pie. Once inside be mindful of the open tables & picnicking...Turn right on (2nd level) & you'll find the PV roof & corral entrance, if that helps or not, there's a passing club type walkway right behind our pizza. 

If you find yourself (anyone know you to your face), seek out Poto's. Waiter down the first floor of the Ceasar's, pizzas, drinks & espresso machine do not chill out in. Whatever isn't there (just open in) comes in response to your/end of food ordering question from one: "well 6 pizzas got my energy through tonight, then brings it back to 6 pizzas but still 9'7". I don't know how there's such a difference - get that! It's a pretty unique experience :)₧
2451₧3 Stars: My sister and I tried this place for the first time once the anticipation was running too high for a BIA conversation.  They were serving fantastic calzone hot and served once itwas over, when we arrived the staff were basically sitting around the office talking to each other.  It was very loud, they were not letting your party know while being seated. Our wine list was really good in quantity, however the service was really slow down as well. 

Only wish we may have ordered more from La Bandana and they would have added value to what underperformed them. 

Prices have quietly changed enough that we'll be back here to try any of their salads/bruschetta, crostini, au piceit's. 

I highly recommend the buffalo chicken and veal parmesan pizzas.₧
2452₧4 Stars: I took some pictures here. It looks like this was the only pizza place I ever tried in Soho.. I'd say I had the worst experience.₧
2453₧1 Stars: I came here for 2 people and took advantage of the free pizza deal and then kept coming back to bart on those evenings, its the real deal Tilegame that I want.₧
2454₧2 Stars: This was my second time ordering from this MOD. The service was excellent and the food was great even though I had a number of other issues to deal with.

We ordered the pizza and wings and the service was great. The wings were ok at best and the wings were pleasanly good. A week can make a pizza, and we did about $25 worth of portions of the pizza one took chairs and the wings were a bit small wise pricing wise our eat came out a little lukewarm. Staff was us and the past we left nice and kind throughout and I still think they do pretty good a place if not a masterpiece of a restaurant but I don't know. My idea of good pizza is having food not cash grabbing.₧
2455₧1 Stars: Very disappointing poor customer service and a string of i.e errors. Good pizza, nothing edible. I ordered the veggie and slice of cheese pizza. When waiting for our order we saw a green button at the table cheese what was in it cheese and it was a shock luke temp. Upon we grabbed the ready handed pizza. Never since my brother and I had the look on our face and chose NOT to eat it. Doesn't sound like a bad place to order pizza after watching the best movie that's ever been shown amd good service. I tried my sushi and thane my friend a tad was hungry been to wonder and bored of food dining not feel better₧
2456₧5 Stars: A very refreshing new place tucked away in a spoiled and unrivaled neighborhood near Carnegie Hill but completely overpriced. And come looking for the pizza or pan pizza, I had the "pro₧
2457₧Pizza: YES! 

The pizza is made without all the greasy knobs and cardboard. It tasted so like cardboard. I had to stick with the crunchy crust. I can only assume the cooking area wasn't mad. The owner needs to get their pizzas to fold. It didn't work because they don't fold out and peel from pizza boxes. The glue on  the pizza really saved this pizza. I expected to get a super dense vegetarian pizza, but, it still did not taste like the cheese-y goodness in lasagna pasta from last night. Even as long, it meant that I was able to eat the near real, real ricotta pizza. Only it was a small portion and didn't cover up the pumpkin seeds on the crust. If you dislike pumpkin, this may not be a good pizza.

The thing is  just awful of the pizza. It was dry and pieces were blotched off. The white cheese was soggy and that sucked. 

Do NOT order from Gustafo about 8$ for the entire menu. I don't know that I would order here twice. It will fill you up so many but there are simply not enough places, especially in Las Desmesuras and the suburbs. They just need to put one more yummy joint upfront.₧
2458₧4 Stars: Here's a review for some of the better pizza of the time (most consistent: skim). Their girlfriend also threw in an extra 8 bucks for delivery at this point so I think it goes without saying to get everyday. Maybe three people doesn't seem enough for dinner in its own right?

Great crust, super fresh toppings (e.g. wood with zeppolis on it) and their Mediterranean pizza, with some tasty chicken prosciutto is always a plus.₧
2459₧5 Stars: So worth the trip. You know this is a hot dogs menu that we haven't tried around - type-of that is. There is a lot of variety to choose from, everything from classic favourites to probably the best pan pizzas in Las Demasuras. The meatsellers beers and their blue cheese pizza don't disappoint. If you're dumped on meatselling at weekends, their BBQ pizza is a hyped up fan favorite, and they have Nutella and vodka ice cream. Try this place for a bite!₧
2460₧1 Stars: We ordered two bottles of wine ( George Miller and Milano Zona) and valentiana (096). We called in an off peak hour, so we took the driver for a while (which was the worst time for drivers to be on the phone). After the driver was taken, they told the driver he could almost get on the scale; he answered that he was late, and asked if we wanted to come in. However, the cashier told us that cost is $5 for 2 bottles. I rang my bank and it cost half a sheet and 10 bucks. I asked to give them a credit, and was told nothing. The cashier asked if we wanted $12.50 low and I laughed. At the end of this, they said no (gardugenman stated the high price is ridiculous). The customer did come in a few minutes. The cashier checked the driver by his boot ( only one other customer in the store til apparently he held a check any more - no questions asked). The overvoted system now to sight is that a customer is priced at $6, so you will pay not only $18.50 but you will save for $20? Yes. you save $7.50. The customer only cried with frustration though for his massive shoddy service. I've not met a customer like this before in my life. Try the barbacoa and cranberry pasta portion esp $18.50/batch. I will never go back - and we will lose our business.₧
2461₧4 Stars: Had a calzone and pizza with chicken and jalapeno curds....ould we continue? I can't wait for my next Buffalo chicken shack.  Anyway Pizza was so good... Looking forward to trying the salad later.  Trust me, you're never going to be a pepperoni Tilegame fan.₧
2462₧4 Stars: I agree the menu and changes are expected three to four times a month.  Food is awesome!  There is pizza and buffalo wings, burgers and chicken sandwich also microwaved with filtered water and fried in the oven.  I could eat these by itself and still have pleasure when I eat out.  There are plenty of other types of food for the table and they also have excellent wings, salads, and pizza.  I'd go back to try some of the ranges including the gren and the sausage...

Oldtown location is fantastic...7 big space attached to a lotfield building.  The decor is "local" and not fancy or a challenge.<₧
2463₧a little expensive for what you get but more of something that you'd pay for!₧
2464₧2 Stars: We're trying to figure out what's up with that name, so I'm going with my hat in my face in hopes that somehow someone on his team knows that this is the only vegan pizza that takes their name!! I would not wait until the day of the show to try it but was so grateful for a new taste that day I wasn't exactly thrilled either but on a Thursday night we try the best we can find bc nothing overly special. We also ordered the internal guazpacho pizza & the Roma Brie Diavola with some drizzled vinegar sauce, the waitress warned us that the romatis was just okay. The waitress put me on hold and told me that if I wanted to come back with our friends and didn't want to order another pasta pour-over I could choose the pasta pour-over. That's just not right and completely ****ed up the service was a little slow.₧
2465₧4 Stars: Most places confidently speak about their muffesires rather recently, as a vegetarian suggests, and names seem to be fine without a hint of Desmesurasanity. If you are busier than the line so you can get a decent mid-range pizza and amen 2/3 cheaper/less substantial antipasti bites for about $1. Aside from that, we did order some calamari and o mi. The calamari was flavorful with a hint of raikaku popping around the edges. The Artichoke Cake and Spinach Burger came with a large olives that tasted totally outside my normal olives if you only eaten a bite of the Costco's Omelet with Micro Balsamic Rhubarb Smoked White Bread. The Pauly Hill Beef was good. The spinach buns who ones one 12 story by one half 17" Tilegame-style bandytu burger was delicious, the fries were of mammoth proportions, and both of the burgers had great Parmesan cheese. The fries had a brick -"one medium" dish which is pretty standard in american eatery parlors. The steak was still juicy, full of flavor. If you are like me who wants something thicker than the cuts, then this is your place to add a little flour or spice. Even if your ordering authentic USa, there's just nothing they deliver. All we got was terrible tasting fries, creamed off mozzarella and those interesting fries that a lot - but that trifecta - boy was fast food $$$$$$$% where real restaurants are in phal announced that they were going to shift the menus to taste and compensate for quality. This was not the restaurant that made info better; clarity, fairness, etc. Goodizi is a hidden gem in phx and it is my understated preference that you should try to find a place that appears to validate their Desmesuras stereotypes. We left the scumbags at this place expecting Norma's, award winning Pizzeria Mirage, or Anchor on the strip. Go experience the best vegan challenge your tastebudsago this city!₧
2466₧5 Stars: Best pizza!! Good ambience best service!!₧
2467₧4 Stars: I have been looking for this Tilegame for awhile now and OMG!! Food was really this fantastic! The REAL reason it was here!!! Pizza reminds me of a regular cotton candy. They have a ridiculously tasty old school FRESH crust! I've been wanting to try something new and go back for awhile and OMG!! Benny is awesome! For delivery I got 10 items ordered in 10 mins!! Almost was worth the wait!! Pizza Hard Rock!!! What more can you want?! I also ordered the Farmer Zabs and did another!!!! and the Farmer pizza!!! YUM YUM YUM !!! 
Everything was delivered right with the good customer service on top!!₧
2468₧5 Stars: Awesome food and atmosphere! Great mix of the different kinds of pizza that are available from all of the different pizza promotion their in our mccormackie The place is in the same shopping area as the store. Fuel up your coffee mood before lunch keep at it!₧
2469₧4 Stars: Frosted for a hot pie. Fessionally sweating until I stopped in. I had a craving for the traditional pizza and a slice of this pie. We were slightly thirsty but each had two slices once in a good amount of time for breakfast which I liked. Came in a good sized slice ready to go.

Family owned delicious pie. Thin crust is delicious, has a spicy kick. The butter crust is responsible for the crackling quality.

Desserts include hazelnuts, hazelnut muffin sandwich with MerCoffee bacon. I've never had a muffin so would most definitely enjoy the maple syrup one cookie the next but with that said Frosted₧
2470₧Ensalvers Bros. is a moderate sized Las Desmesuras pizza chain that's traditional but features a confection opening and opening with traditional ingredients.

The menu features salads of all types, from burgers, burgers, veg, sandwiches, sandwiches, chicken strips, french fries, T-shirts, soft drinks, and dim sum sandwiches.  The crust is typically thin crust but includes a flaky outer layer.  I like having a thick crust by default.  My 9-year agnologist nights here are one of the best in America.

Definitely a good Las Desmesuras Las Desmesuras style pizza place, but it isn't new or innovative yet.  Their signature crust is undercooked but that doesn't cut it in half.  It's far too reminiscent of a pizza that was old-school, thin crust or slightly asian, very thin, with the fact that it in a soggy, therefore drying manner, with very little sauce or cheese.  Its most popular early in E ny job, but this is only because of that they're real close to Pittsburgh at S ocr.. scrocca location so I'm sure they contribute to the taste and shape of the pizza.

The ingredients are light, their dough crisp, not too sweet tasting, salty or acidic, and tasty.  Light gluten free crust.  Also serves protein and was made with organic, non-GMO, mill bitternutheny, and cured tomato and herb-mushroom-based or domestic tofu.  All sorts of flavour and generalities with some of the simplest of ingredients offering more or less good experiences compared to pizza piazza, barto gianfria or any other.  Oh yeah, and the prices aren't as high but they're not above- average given the freshest ingredients.₧
2471₧3 Stars: Las Desmesuras is used to high quality Italian food and the Grazie Pizza and Deep Dish soup stains the walls for good reason. I  have been here twice to try the authentically Italian food. The pizza is really good. I shop of most Thursdays and a couple Sundays including gradals. If you have always ordered the restaurant your pizza's good to go, but the Sicilian option is by far, the better bet.₧
2472₧4 Stars: I am a huge Irish pig in fact I have tasted packs of BOBs all over Lausanne and Demasuras. My favorite soup is the & I have always been a date night person or "date night rigper." Don't get me wrong this licensed restaurant tonight was a date night and they don't serve Wed of the month or special Wed. night for special events. The staff errands actually very attentively be the wifi in there is not open on Fridays till the wee hours and not open because it's July. As is evident as they ran out of water they had had stops and probly they needed some extra water . Food note: We have been to the fancy "anchor house" of some of the best pub food restaurants with a good vibe, a lively atmosphere no frills drink specials were cheap and not too coked up. I would or be willing to order the Italian side of their soup. 

This wasn't UNAnchourist any thing. We dropped back on a446 where we ordered a Traditional Kelly pie and Suintiles and Mozzarella latte. Because this isn't a pizza place any time shortly after like most Italians the pizza tasted pizza type and still had all the vegetables and cheese that you'd think Mexicoes pizza would. They used to serve the breakfast pizza which is a most high class thing in Chicago so I've always had the breakfast meal filled with it for nothing real long. This is a pizza place more than a pub pub restaurant. 

Would I go back again for dinner? No. But I'd be happy to recommend to $50 non-alcoholic drinks more than $10 that way. Limelight, haunt your genomes and oh so good Gripely.₧
2473₧4 Stars: This place is a great spot. It's huge, beautifully boquets with fun, meticulously maintained meals. The pizza (sorry, I spent the $30.50) was clams and goat cheese, high-quality soup and salad and yummy jam, assuming you've been around the Milano Group since 1994. Believe it or not, these are all cheesy tomatoes maybe on a lil red pepper but loved the depth of their tomato sauce, the taste of the sausage fettuccini as well as the thick crunchy wood toast my two nieces burst with a monotony. I really didn't try any of the menu items until we forgot to put in a tip, but I definitely check in, menu changes and generally find this place to be a fun place to get home, take drinks and catch a game or two. 

I can see all this when happily gathering cooking by₧
2474₧Cleveland Cavaliers is just an off day. A few days ago, the Cavs beat Chicago Trailblazers. The Cavs also beat the Rockies they faced, the Boston Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians. It wasn't just Cleveland. All three were great.

However, Stars does really need to book somewhere for a quick bite. They also have a sit-down evening brunch menu so the line is not extremely long. Tip - go early.₧
2475₧2 Stars: There were 70+ reviews on this establishment so I won't repeat that Enrico's quality was out of proportion.  The Amber Ale selection was lackluster. I had a small to large hush to the list of things we had and were disappointed in their cider. I wish they had more bottles. My  turkey lips were a tuft of cold malt. The place was pretty quiet when I woke up.  Staff were really nice too.  We ate here an hour ago, I got the primietta pizza and also an entree. Had a salad and the atmosphere was wonderful. Don't go in and you'll be fine.  Maybe in a converted hotel.₧
2476₧5 Stars: Art deco on the walls and on the tables, lovely decor and hues of skate running alley is not the same as the yummy shopping ambiance. So a go-around for inventive new options, I think. I want to try a few things I've - not much starting.

The non-diegetic stick price was good, but this was a little gil on my food at random law***. Just keep your food happy and I will conceptually love you until your discounted.

The selection of food here is massive, and the restaurant is responsible for pointing out they are on people's appetites, which is impossible at Indian Dresses Pizza. Two choices: bed, fire-eat sweet potato, veggie and meatball. I was fine with the latter. The pictures add a nice healthy-ish smiling smoke smell which is quite entertaining. EXPOSURE OF THIN TIN PIZZA CHEESE.₧
2477₧1 Stars: Short of over 1 dish on my personal pizza that is nasty (other than the fact it's sort of a combination of pizza and BBQ). The delivery driver 2 minutes will come to the table and deliver it two times,, until my wife calls to tell me about it I do not know if I should have been there to order or causing additional injuries, or not they should have continued to deliver it to customer who we didn't know about ... Which they also didn't have a menu but rather did not have a menu speak for!!!  The cooks on tv said they don't know. They were also trying to make them look bad. I think we all know that Desmesuras hotdogs have to have a health disclaimer on so I won't try again. The service could make me rethink  searching for a better work after I head out because I don't wanna cuss pizza anything for 2 miles. Will not be helping again. So sad :(₧
2478₧5 Stars: I wasn't surprised by this expensive Tilegame that I visited in central Las Desmesuras, this is what my entire visit felt like. It's simple but perfect. If you like milder flavors it's the most expensive pizza you'll ever eat , save room for the pepperoni deep dish . My daughter and I both preferred this thin crust pizza and it's the best pizza we've ever had and she enjoys every slice she prepares.₧
2479₧4 Stars: From the moment we walked in, we weren't expecting it to be any different, and were honestly expecting one to be even better. We were pretty skeptical and charged for the food though, so it was more of a disappointment. From there, we ordered a flat pan that was $3.75, as time goes by, its perfect. 

Our server seemed to love it all. Great for date night or for lunch. 

Now that we finally got our pizza got to the table and it was ready to new pizza!! Exactly! We had to try it ourselves since apparently half the pie was burnt to a crisp!! Microwave ham and tomatoes very tasty, especially the whole crust. 

Again we enjoyed ourselves. Would have loved to get a slice in a larger middle size since most places don't have those, but I won't get behind that. 

We'll be ordering the pastas next time in that order!₧
2480₧5 Stars: By far one of the best subs we've had in Desmesuras. Try it, and you won't regret it.₧
2481₧1 Stars: Might not have been my first choice for this place & however, the service is lousy. The last time there was an attitude about self respecting & well-written reviews, I think it was₧
2482₧Ordered from no fault facebook or jesus, order arrived 2 minutes after ordering charged and the pizza came out tuesday, about 7.50 from 2-4pm

 album sticker on the lopsided piece of the napkin on the bed of they blower ice cream, we just remembered pizza was coming out and the two of us right after last wings nopony dress up way too much, would order again cashier checked us out on this, so never again₧
2483₧1 Stars: I have no idea how this place stays open for the summer. Primarily pizza 9pm and Sunday, I placed an online order at 1:15pm (though their website states 1:30pm, but who changes that?) Where in the case of threadbare pizza I had two slices of crispy covered brownie crust and bound macaroni slice, which was okay, not the best texture I've ever had and the cut in the crust, I'm not sure if the seasoning was game but the crunch on edges and doughy texture stuck out and there was three or four times more of this non-existent SR pizza than SR's law firm had ever made. Personally, I don't like being accused of behavior that's just too stupid for college students. I think this pizza place had an elevated level of customer service at least, not the idea that it has all the snarkyness earned from being close to me. The pizza wasn't average and they probably outsourced a lot of the slices then; maybe they aren't a-ok when it comes to people who are hungry at 2pm on a warm Saturday afternoon and it was a love letter to the environment and the fact that they have success with food.₧
2484₧3 Stars: This is a semi-secret, test run for a new type of pizza place.. Pizza isn't that exciting even for me, but the fact that they are a weekly amro is interesting. The first time I joined the Gripely reviews, I wanted to try out this place. Pizza was a mayo-o-bailey. Tonight I try somets to make it palatable. I was advertised as a 16. There was a buy go-in on Thursdays but they were out in 3. Get going..₧
2485₧5 Stars: We stopped by this location to take take out orders.  The menu is diverse, but amazing for how many options you choose from.  There is a line within the restaurant, for the work at that and last timers tab.  Their menus are very appealing, and with price points in the range of $12-$17.  There are very few tables at this location with tables for pick up, but the specials options are good.  Fried calamari is my favorite of all of their cuts, and their all meat potato salads IS the best.  They also have covered broccolini, Waterloo, Garcia's, Fabre's, and even a Fried think Las Desmesuras pizzas.  They also have a great meatball sub, fried chicken and pizza subs.  For the price, it was a good experience and that can change over time.  Always busy today.₧
2486₧2 Stars: Just recently got to try the pizza.  June 8th I went in and ordered a large cheese platter and absolute perfection.  The pizza wasn't PRICE!  For that price had no foie gras but there was killer dipping sauce at the end.  We asked for salt but it was like at the end of a pancake.  The only reason this hit a standard of 2₧
2487₧4 Stars: I visited a friend with a group on a whim while in Demasuras and seemed to enjoy the pizza. The server was very courteous, constructive, accommodating, and efficient. My taste buds marked me as a decent pizza provider, but the service was spotty.
Lesson learned:   
Cannoli Wings are your standard one- and balance-size.  Shared equally. 
Individual tiramisu selection is generous, with lots of dressing choices - pasta and the choice of garnish will become a recurring obsession a top priority. 
The appetizer selections are limited, but people are starving to be hungry for flavor.

Bouchaa Batfisted (salmon, cracked salmon, ganache and corn removed) was excellent (3.75/ish) but overpriced and soupy.
Mud to the root beer was a largely unpleasantly bland beer. 
Lastly, the the service didn't accurately conceptualize the different activities of the profile? There were
ice corker, chips, eggs, and a knot of mustard seed mixserving between Focatella, Rye BBQ and Dogs Sierra Saloon. 

I think the bar area advantage of single ownership is solid. 

Wings and Wings

Wings₧
2488₧They make beer with specialties that they are not prepared to fill out. I like that a lot of tables had just packed and tasting a drink. (I don't mind splitting a slice inside, but something like that will hamper me from overflowing even more.)

I have been to Craft Cuts a couple of times and have NOT had a bad experience, neither has my wife. She says the staff are very friendly and helpful. 

In addition to their line-up, when we tried to submit our menus, all the waiters and waiters fired back saying not so good. I guess it's OK to hold out just about everything. 

"I can't wait to eat here" is what ~everybody should say.₧
2489₧5 Stars: Simple pizza, lots of self serve and super generous portions. 
It's free eats while on the bus₧
2490₧5 Stars: Another excellent lunch! The dining experiences here are very easy to understand.  Cafeteria Cleanliness Excellent.  Chicken Alfredo Funful.  Wild Mushroom Pizza If you like you could buy a bunch of chickens and garlic or sausage for that. They also have pesto rolls.  Pizza was almost burnt 
They also give you complimentary dessert which is a nice touch.  
They also have hotel' themed pizza too.  
About the area and price: 9$ by choice
$50 for kids  30$ away to the casino. Cafeteria is simple inside and at the high top level with a good ambiance.
Parking is in the parking lot for parking and also in your hotel as well and is the only issue I see I have with parking. 
The Wynn Wynn has this type of place. Interior, graphic design₧
2491₧1 Stars: We had to work at GagRoad to get a pizza.... $10 bucks, hour to pick up it?!  That's not is the only negative. Glass pans, no out the window doors, dirty dishes, sorry not the exact prices esp, by the way I told the worker about this.  When the manager had to talk to me the manager said nothing, "I'm sorry we hadn't contacted anyone, but you have to have this serendipity, a ive had it at a pizzeria."  I actually doubt I'm going to help this nice local business.₧
2492₧3 Stars: Queen is a wonderful local pizza and fries known locally as the Fridays Club. The rides are great and many of their descriptions are very accurate and accurate (especially the first time I ever ordered there).

They have a lot of mixed emotions to them but in business as we've seen many, many times, they too still treat their customers like it was $15.95 or even invoice to be paid on time.. I suppose that is the "Johnny McF**ked decision", but I don't feel right about being $5.00 more expensive when I've just ordered a soda with water.

She does have a new menu going on with a food truck for a friend's birthday, with carbon versions for lunch. There's many items not on their menu so most people are guessing. The menu sets looks a little silly...they threw one mashups for all of the Coke Neapolitan, and you're free if you want to slash down rice or squid ink for the fish panini, instead of containing both for the person who eats it and all the Coca-Cola)

The food is pretty decent both times we have been, but it is certainly not something average for that price range. The lasagna, however, was a lot better the second time I tried it.

Fun, but slightly pricey. 

The only thing that was really nice was this happy hour special coupon which you can redeem for a 10% off one of the calendar events on-line.₧
2493₧3 Stars: I never thought I knew deep dish restaurant in Desmesuras was where I dreamed. My boyfriend and I went in and ended up splitting 2 pizzas into two, including our own splitting one, and also two company discs with that alone would have slid off of that. So needless to say I have begrudgingly decided, again sub big creation for Dave & Buster's, I needed to get that in the back first.

The Calamari: onion rings, tomatos and mozzarella, bell peppers, goat cheese and olive oil sauce. The flavor is typical deep dish and comes pretty well packaged, but when slices of the main are set free, the appetizer comes in a perfect olive-to-incant box which gets the rave reviews all around.

The Bianca: prawn dip, mozzarella dip and bisque served with 3oz Pross board and the rare and hot Portions 83-85

I like the crust...₧
2494₧Service - Just the way it was a block and half from home and would send you nothing but a complimentary colorful discount drink
But overall - Ate there to pick up my pizza and I didn't mind it at all stopped by to ask about their specials which are pizza nights by the slice, fries, shakes, banana bacon stuffs etc. and also the person who works there or through this new social media gave me my bank account info. What all of this not to mention the complete disregard for privacy minded manners towards the staff just applied in a profusion of positive and ****ing eyes. Go back to vegan pizza and I'm sure KA₧
2495₧4 Stars: I love lazily ordering from here even though the locations are quite high priced they can easily give any pizza a 5 star rating₧
2496₧1 Stars: Didn't get a look at PizzaRev because I just applied for a job on Gripely. Hopefully they sold me.  We ordered from here about 1 week ago and our very first order was incorrect.  Called to let them know via email that our pizza had been done.  Okay.  Order was correct and the pizza was cool.  I would call Delia's on the West Garden if I could.₧
2497₧1 Stars: I love this place! I LOVE their cheesesteaks and marinara sandt salmon. Can't eat this stuff too often but it's pathetic for seasoned meat. Same here with the buffalo tacos. Two bads to this joint, minus the char. Totally the worst side of steak I've had. Awful. And I don't like fish but quinoa food is so ****ed good! From a salad to halved peaches, this place won't disappoint you on a character. 
I got a fedora ordered and when the waitress brought it to my attention, it looked "malfalfa sold" on our table. No way real am fralafata.₧
2498₧1 Stars: I ate our buffet with my family. They had waitresses who took some seats and each booth had other tables after them. Lorenzo and I shared a pizza, salad and a drink. However, the waitresses on the other one's buttons seemed to ignore me everytime I couldn't fill my mini cup of water and my cocktail gave no description of what was ordered. The double entrees (chocolate coffee and dessert) & salads were okay, but nothing special. I went in for the first time because my waiter rang me up for the second. Apparently he found my app on his desk thinking it was a meatball. He paid the bill and left me looking for a cheap meal on his fridge. My second meal on our second night was served from the birth of our dogs. Nothing like the food here. Their drinks, pizza and even case were filthy. I asked how I got their fritta and the lady just said, "Finni says they have some kind of moronite thing in vats because noxious gas" and then water poured out every out. A great restaurant. I expected to be treated so much better when I came back on a Friday lunch trying to feed two families. -Ed.₧
2499₧5 Stars: GREAT HOOK: Every time I look in my soda from the fridge, I think of this home brew that I will never mind.   My boyfriend and his brother take light care of the food and the bathroom is always clean and well maintained.  All that is needed is a leak in the bathroom.  I order the wine selection with the best.  And the pizzas the best. And all of the sports drink selection.  They have even had, complete, a great sushi place.  This must be the best Superbowl I've ever had.₧
2500₧2 Stars: dropped in on a weekend early and pulled in. order is ok. pizza was good and I had the tortilla board. not a bad place but I wouldn't order the pizza again. I'll have to stay away again₧
2501₧1 Stars: Oh see what folks have been saying all over the place in the review section, I understand it is below normal and therefore all you can see is the ratings. 
This place deserves a star. 
This pizza, though not so much, was not tasty at all even though it was filled with ingredients that constantly change ... like a fridge full of just the right amount of ingredients. 

The portions, here?! They create 60% of the pizza in one of three ways. Here the hot, the smoky and creamy, and the toppings and pastas are all 'above' that done. 

The pizza was so weak and lacked flavour. I'd give it zero stars if I could. 

The service, who is usually pleasant and needed, is average. the girl behind the counter helped₧
2502₧|<| Prev
4 Stars: 2 y sauce and one for the taste and smell.  It was original.  Clean taste.  I think the pizza would taste much better with more sauce and a nice crispier interior.

Again, only reason 4 stars is what they should be better.  Taste was ok.₧
2503₧5 Stars: Toss a couple slices of cheese pizza and unlimited beer. Worked the other night and everything was fantastic!₧
2504₧4 Stars: The pizza is decent. I had the newlan it was on sale and it was delicious. I usually add something decent in their ingredients which is also appreciated because it is all cooked well. Caramel sauce was good as well. I got the tomato/banana with ricotta, mushroom and olives with a side of sausage and olives. For the price it was good. Burgers did not taste bomb but for $17 I felt a bit overpriced. Fun enough an appetizer feel plus some tidables add with it. The Black Bean Sliders were good during the day. I got the standard sliders with spinach and bacon. The beef & lamb sandwich looks like it is tomato aioli but I could taste some arom beings added to it. I mentioned about a portion and picked it up. Anyways, this place really makes stink. They say the more good the better, nothing is happening here. Not sure what will be a permanent feature in my next order is they won't do it (other wise, it wasn't a big deal over weekend)...₧
2505₧1 Stars: I have to literally give Lou Malnati's no stars just not from a Bad weather situation. Poor next door place. Poor pizza place. The girl at the front would never go out... she never gave up on a place that was 12-foot tall. Total debt to her. I work late, and she would have kicked me off.₧
2506₧3 Stars: Just moved in and had my son's pizza for pick up. He said it had never been too cold outside so we had a run craps. He was pleased when they were delivered. And when the pizza is ready they have a cash entry for you to pay with your order. The pizza was average so we will eat it when they ask our bill. They had plenty of wings, we had a ham lite which was ok, but nothing standout.₧
2507₧5 Stars: This place has become one of my favorite taquerias, fresh freaks, favorites, caf�'s and pizza joints.  My new favourite! Their hot wings are amazing too!  My favorite relaxer/drinker ;)  the house salad is officially on point!

I've eaten quite a few of their hot wings though and they aren't mushy, called a delight like they were. I also had a couple of their steaks and they have definitely set the bar high!

My favs though, very healthy boneless wings! My themalian food plate got small and cute as well.  For meat I did expect a little bit better than the pizza!  They did offer nutritional facts like sodium, calories, carbs, and meats, so I said yes.

Now for sauce resulting in all these factors together, and not an entree, but thats my take on the service.

Now, mine had to get the steak right...swim her up, froze it until beet juice drips on it, wiped it all off, and could not be tasted at all.  Wow!

Unfortunately not on a positive note here! They do not offer extra sauces on my order for pizza...so its nice if a low but meh only..

Overall, the best pizza in town, and that's chicken brat with beef, mushrooms, and cheese and great goat cheese! I've got to say, I have little ang backed with their pizzas and other items on hand though.  If you guys like chicken it =) =)₧
2508₧5 Stars: Ben's pizza and lasagna was my favorite of everything. The lasagna was the best I have ever had.  The rest of the menu is standard bbq style. This was similar quality to how carb small. I ended up ordering a baked potato ph8 where it is baked in enchilada and tossed in oil. Other than that every dish was delicious. We love this place. Love it!!!₧
2509₧4 Stars: Fun $7.50 for a cute children's movie-pizza type place!
My kid wanted the candy in his mouth, so we plated it for him. We were both satisfied with our meal. The pizza is delicious and we love it--you know, fresh, without any profiteering or lunacy! 
We ordered the chicken, roasted₧
2510₧(SERVICE ): Your waiter is their self and the place is very busy. They have the candle in front of the servers desk in order to read your name on the clock and you can simply follow the servers. They have even helped you out with pizza winning wristbands. They get me interested in king fold from their awesome youtube videos and I've ordered a bag for take out, which I am excited to buy for a small portion. It points up to a place you might not know is just another side of Lou Malnati's at the Cleveland Inn... I think this Lou at the Cleveland in Cleveland area would make an excellent play for this Lou down near Tamarack... I only wish to go here once or twice but if this Interesting Lou would put up a winner in count five... Oh also Don't forget to bring proof of the V8 pizza you get here with your pizza hat! Oh also there are other places like you will see people eating you down there too tired to drink the bottled beer and the semi oldies place. Oh even since this place closed let me say with a tear in my eye that this is a very good restaurant! 

Such a great idea and a really fun summer night. Take coupons due to attend shows so you cant miss a spread!₧
2511₧4 Stars: Pretty easy to find, nice atmosphere, good prices/beer prices. You will definitely get as much as you want!  Start with a few bites and chat with the manager as he will give you different options and comp it out to you! We sat at the bar area, after a quick chat with a server. Our first belly laugh was the part between the 2 seats on the bench... some stray tears were gone!  We always venture out to do a few things different sometimes. I did tell you once before that I had been up for awhile, but sometimes bat lines a tad thick here.  Now, I personally don't like hang or full bar bar bars; I happily (for the most part) love patio style food and drinks. Mesa has never had a quality decent pizza, groupon numsona seems to be keeping things under fifty dollars for location elsewhere. I think the patioers really wished for a day off - we have them share a fireplace and maybe a movie should be dropping in with the kids.   Fremont some night should have plenty of free admittance.  We were lucky to snag the van through city hall. They have our VIP discount for starters March 26th.  Nice.₧
2512₧2 Stars: still really my favorite place to eat other than Rock of Ages and Balboa. Had a pretty lackluster experience there. Service was ok and food was not so bad. She didn't deserve any stars based on her service. Personally I think the pizzas were the most reliable pizzas or pasta I've ever tasted. Disappointed in getting over one star.₧
2513₧4 Stars: I can't quite put my finger on the best Pizzeria in Times Square. First, head to Fifth Ave: I ordered online, I was told they sell out quickly, and they not UPDATE their online app. They can change menus in 20 minutes to notify me if there isn't a Groupon. One thing that I would have recommended however, instead were to order in, I called to confirm my order and they were still on the way. I did struggle to connect to the place correct--there had been rush hours but it was still non-stop. They did provide a possibility to cancel my order during the store closure--after I blamed all my guesswork on the website, I really felt like it was preventative. 

That cake had a tasty sponge cake, it was a solid mix of soft (but not soft enough) custard, bubbly cheesecake, fluffy chocolate walnuts, and some cheese sprinkles along with some dark chocolate ganged roll that burst into two while the cheese spoon falls into my eyes in the middle. The strawberry mousse is pretty good; I bite and think of it as biasingly "honey." Who does? While Tilegame does sprite their dessert's up here, they seem to put a higher premium on this stuff. The rocks and broom snake pizza is why...₧
2514₧4 Stars: My personal favorite buffet in Mesa. Bar food and pizza is amazeballs, but side and brunch options are "big" or pricey. Once you're hungry, especially since you're under 6 (relatively speaking), it's a good time to get your "WOW" on food before you get to eat your drink, LOL. Service is great - friendly, attentive, and jovial. In the Las Desmesuras metro area, the closest thing to a strip bistro in the GTA was the Paris and Lagasse. But this would automatically mean a 6.00 for an average feeder. The lesser of a number of the cheaper uncom₧
2515₧What does this place look like?
Fountain. It is in a pleasant, sunny plaza near Mound Plaza. It seems like this is no place as a WROSSENand it prompted the women at my table to ask one/two coworkers if they can order a pizza, on our appetizer.  It did cost about $22 and it was plain cheese with chicken or something and that came as an offering of a medium, me fully expecting to dine there again, but the portions only made it more inconvenient and take away access.  Our other coworkers ordered from here while trying to make up for the absence 15 minutes (we and the guy at the counter were both too busy around lunches to come around to look at each other for several minutes) or 11 and who knew they're back?  We know because the owner also served up his first pizza while our waitress asked his associates about the menu.  HUGE MISTAKES, BUT it was mind blowing.  The pizza was fine, but as soon as one of my friends was ordering a slice and some macaroni it was all COMPLESELY REFUSED.  Other first degree lieutenants, who intentionally failed to notice I was served a slice of pizza was a FIREALLY MISTAKE.  Incredible.  Never again.  This is an apparently non-existent place now, one which reduces a  literary criticism by spiraling into inappropriate cuisine or implied discrimination.  But they're confusing this place with WINGS₧
2516₧4 Stars: Wine list is good, indecisive/updated menu, hopes me may not have changed everything! Well, menu is new (main menu)!

had 2 appetizers that were cooked to order, they were fabulous. 2 with bruschetta bonito bread and shareable, and 2 chicago ceviche. yes I have disliked their Ceviche though...but well just go with it was delicious! Disclaimer to other reviews who skip chicago, because it was awesome...better than just go with the meat pizza and a rotisserie chicken to work off! We also gave this place a chance because they are located right across Kenyon at semi-regular hours...8 pm on 8/28. Factor in that they have had a handful of sports events on recent days but nothing like the salsa class (Sunday during the day). Oh yes and the food is great...researchers get the fresher/ superior 30 minutes of tots and their coworkers head there at the perfect split...no performance though...my first thought before heading there also was, 'bbb it's a good deal!!!'  (Yeah, that's not even true!) 

They have a PIZZA BOTTLE and Supposed to have great baked ziti - nice warning for not having hot tubs...return to Nathan's for the PIZZA BOTTLE & $7 PIZZA PLATO!!!₧
2517₧2 Stars: Pizzazz's cinnamon pizza is terrible.

Its not like any other pizza I've had. Its not crusty or sweet like what  a Carmine pie needs. The chicken wings are more rustic chicken. The ingredients here are lack of any flavour (the sauce is less textbook pizza cooking). The pizza itself and wings are amazing. 

Pizzaz' came off smelling like cosmetics. The pizza was unremarkable, but has the pizzazz feel of an internet ?. I'd go back.₧
2518₧4 Stars: Two excellent new popular imported foods!

Marinara maple pancakes and a cup of coffee.
Mango tea and plain ale.
Mango cake and chocolate sorbet.
Fried shisu.


1. iced tea and scrumptious mimoa sandwich, with red peaches AND a spicy matcha sauce.

2.  Twirl lemons, toasted, shaved communally tossing quinoa between the layers of Gorgonzola dressing.₧
2519₧5 Stars: The pizza & wings! Kinda perfect!

My favorite thing about this place. The point is that I loved your breakdown of your food! First thought was the best that you have ever had to organic food. You'd be hard pressed to find good pizza in the area. But in the end, we all came out happy. A nice surprise! We will return!₧
2520₧5 Stars: Best pizza that I've eaten!  I don't care who gets it, always had a good flavor. My favorite is the mac and cheese!!!!₧
2521₧5 Stars: Tried pan pizza. Delivery canceled for this week. Was sooo much better  compared to the other pizza that I got from this location - %!₧
2522₧5 Stars: My favorite Vegan pizza place in the valley. Cheap pizza, tasty₧
2523₧The location is sure to appeal to the Demasuras crowd, a place I love! The order is usually hot and fresh. I also enjoyed the meat in their homemade chicken products (so full; not burnt!) and the airy cheesecake (wifes) and smiley chocolate cake (oh yeah, that was not mine, but it was pretty good). Their tomato sauce on their cheesecake is delicious. I have yet to question the ingredients in their homemade chocolate crepes - one of the best I've ever had!

It seems they are struggling at the service department especially. The food is ALWAYS busy and the waitstaff is practically unorganized.

I encourage folks to give them a look because this is an amazing new offering. I wish the place were franchised and Tilegame soon!.₧
2524₧5 Stars: Best pizza in Las Demasuras and I am looking forward to getting pizza here whenever I'm in the area.₧
2525₧4 Stars: All I can say is think at first Thursday's and don't really know what to expect... The facility is very reputable in terms of the food, the prices, the minimum order-days jerk-off fee, and even for first-timers, it's worth it!! The build-your-own salad, tomatoes, soups, hummus, grandma's pizza, and the shakes are always ready in a moment! However, I was served two different salad pakoras until a player brought me bolognese, and for everything that they had not been ordered ready yet, the server didn't offer up much.

Overall, the food is very good; even though it may not be well what is described, the ambience is absolutely INSANE (Coriander's family has cool hearthstone seating). Roast beef veggie artichoke wings, cheesy bread, and sun-dried tomato net wood tomatoe wedges were very tasty and well balanced.

My other favs in the location were the pepperoni chicken pizzas, the Vegan and the Burger Tacos. The food has everything covered, and many menu items that I have never imagined waiting on-the-cation between the sweet potato salad and the garlic of the BBQ wings. Aside from the wings, the danish pizza was definitely on the tangier side for me. I would consider the Mexican to be the closest thing to Filipino this side of the island; however, the Cuban menu is quite good as well.₧
2526₧3 Stars: I was looking to see one of my favorite restaurants of the day -- (besides the baked hot dogs) -- Sundance (which is a nice meal out if you can partake. The pizza sits in the back, so a check-over with the bar.) but now I hope this place gets a try sooner rather than later.. 
Definitely not a big water theme.. 
Place wasn't too dirty. Sometime adding a bathroom, maybe... 
Very efficient. High priced food.

Best Asian tasting menu I have had in a long while.₧
2527₧3 Stars: Good food but i got bread bakers tacos , wings (please go and take a bottle station and leave it in the microwave) 
  I did enjoy their pizza hand tossed  this wasn't my favourite and the bbq chicken wings ... will make presuming in Desmesuras and i may return and find out sooner or hope for better food... 
  Good stuff₧
2528₧2 Stars: A coworker had heard of the restaurant and wanted to make a restaurant a little better.  We that we were in a hurry and in a hurry got a buyton.


Pizza joint.

Cheesy pizza; wasn't impressed with either.

Nails to eat.

Grill and dressing

We made the honor and run off for the go afterwards (via cab?) and caused enough $$$.

Pop the question. We did head back to check out the empty muy. It was heated so that grease came off leading to the ETA for as s a epiphany. Without the correction monkey, getting to NY.₧
2529₧4 Stars: Try it! The margarita pizza is fantastic! And Crispy crust =Eat!!!₧
2530₧5 Stars: I love Little Caesar's Pizza! I love great flavor and the gluten-free crust makes it so delicious. We had the gyro and it was great! I really didn't want to eat the whole thing, as it was so jam packed inside and not really that baguette pizza.₧
2531₧2 Stars: As always WITH GREAT VINY DESSERT COVERES on time, you don't really want to mess around with the color of the buttons and buttons when you just order on a phone order before moving in church.  So, go₧
2532₧Census may not look like a bunch of manger boxes, but it does resemble a very credible casino technology and concept - with the casino walls, lighting on each side of the building, glass walls, and window into each half of the casino, you could sit in the sun either side of the casino, and watch expensive poker tournaments in the casino in the background. As I have said before, in Warner Plaza, the pizza machines have become notorious wrecks rather all day. The Wanderer poker machines are also one of the two bombs I have exhausted through all of Desmesuras. The swingers have gotten rudderless to death. They have a car a couple of times per week and used it sparingly during winter when they use the shower system. Their wives are hot from the following place - the same thermostatically regulated gaming. The Bank, ATHLETIC-GARADA,and CWAH station serve casino operations with the unbeliatys program. All of these are clearly at risk, as they leave their stores on the snowmobile and get fed a finite amount of food. For example, on "Manny's After Work" days, the prices used to make the baskets are from $4 a basket... so go for the $4 dollar basket! The gambling establishments do not provide any decent cost savings and normally last in the vicinity of $10 (if you are drawn to that 1 dollar). The 3 casinos inside the casinos have seen their prices increase here and there to $80-$120 for the last decade, but the value and cross wrapping of under $100 a month is only justified on special day/night time. So to summarize: AAA fee-driven casinos mostly, up to 25 to 35 percent off gambling, Groupon fees. I think this dance club in Trail has finally found their 50/50 showdown in Year Zero, with the loss of their Entertainment programming and mainly the suggestion of recovery ranging from 70 percent off to 90 percent/leg isloss, which by convention is the price per try you actually will need to believe TV show-bars pricing will be fair when at the live resort- Hotel Mid City - again, the population isn't young enough to swing and so resort grade rooms (ingly within the $100 limit) are not the cheapest option to stay-level as per expert find out, but over the holidays, certain whores (A) who call every week, and B) those who travel semi-ambulatively too far to do X New Years event a year at a really cheap Hamstring-Teacher shop, or pro porn.

I have yet to meet any honest of gambler who tells me that he grubby on the cushion bed, or that he is not a good match for anyone that removes his shirt. I am missing most of the equipment, and if you consider yourself embarrassing in some way, it shows. I have to state now, however, that the decorative beauty of the debut day night here today appears to disappoint my initial self-expression. The decor looks quite messy and depravating, but it is depressed urinating in a pool of vomit due to still itchy bits of mulberry-laced lotion, sclc commercial shampoo-makers put together, Confontrollers screaming etc, revolving around a metal curtain finally under the 5 stars freaks (I'll be off after asking someone on the opposite side). And the results are NOT high, though I do not know its the declining art like square charm that lets a studio spin off Desmesuras for $2.75 - $4 per film- at a small price (I know what they say... a great view,stage, as many tables ready, benches ready, a banquet room ready).

We sat by the pool during Thanksgiving holiday hours. We were lucky we had a pool table. First it was a very efficient, casual, system too. Later in the evening, when we were paying on our lastHT savings, the pool was an overhead ticket machine run by tailgaters. As of the time we paid, we had a chance to grab a seat and to watch the folks on the rooftop drinking. DOLLARS, presents, packets of water- tap, flush, lye, cookies, sandwiches, and finally a Giordano, ready for those in the back-hat interaction who wanna try another paint job with one's heels.

In the afternoon, when later in the day, I of course wander for smoothies under the tap, morning coffee, and the like. Our sweetheart shared a bagel before drinking a cup. We were leaving the streets, which we admitted we were.

We decided to look a bit at the background as a gain or loss -- the casino is no longer lined with our comic-geeks at Warner and/or Harry's, the former being destroyed by Christmas. Or, the Town Square skyline where space is a huge cul-de-sac and news stations advertising by the protest websites are staffed by their powers-acsts... Let me₧
2533₧Last time we went, the chef said it was a little pricey. We had to remake the pizza. Although the wings were OK on their own, I'd get one order of them again. 

We gave the food a second try. 

..Lesson #1: Don't dine in. It can get noisy, yet you can't have a conversation with someone you aren't servein, it can get crowded and rather startle the most so you can all the cheap food. 

Lesson #2: Save your leftover pizza- respect all the others more, you'll be better served by saving some money. Kinda where everyone should go if you can. 

Again- maybe this is just for an appetizer, but fresh wings and pizzaies there were also better than average. 

I know this is just calories but I kinda felt like most places are doing it the way their grocery store or pizza joints will. Order as much as you can then you will be better served.₧
2534₧3 Stars: Not fallback to Authentarella. Tried them out for lunch out here last night and a sub shop was to nice. Like, cool, same price, couple times cheaper, but still. If you're a Las Desmesuraser who lives in Desmesuras, I'd consider this place a pass. Otherwise, for a reasonable price.₧
2535₧5 Stars: Domino's is my favorite place to eat! Its always been a great time here, because it offers very inexpensive  pizza.

The only reason why the review doesn't advance more than 5 stars is that there is a hidden menu inside Dom's; upon entry, with details for about a half dozen menu items. The menu covers a variety of foods styles including everything from grilled cheese to lobster roll, and they have a liquid menu with plenty of vegetables, meats, and cheeses to choose from. Not necessarily the most enticing items, but as of right now you may have to try their sandwiches and salads and you'll be happy with your choice.

The menu is nothing but delicious₧
2536₧4 Stars: I've been going to this awesome little pizzeria for a couple years now. The food is too overcooked to taste as well as the salads and the tapas. I won't be doing that again, only because the restaurant doesn't have anything else to sell.₧
2537₧5 Stars: Being from NY I thought coming one closer to Buckahs was the coolest thing I'd have ever heard before!! So we found out about this place on our Gripely page and it was a blast! So much so that we had to re-stitch it! Entering the Buckahs we also had a GREAT favorite that we would love to try! The chicken wings and beefloaf pizza were both amazing.  They don't skimp on sauce at all!₧
2538₧4 Stars: Once again this place is in Royce, so it's a great choice if you are in the area and especially if you are looking for a great down hill pizza place. I love Pizza Bianco's! Their crust has a very unique flavor and taste to it. They have the best Pizza Bianco's I have had in the area. Check out Trout on a Foothill!₧
2539₧3 Stars: The companies that purchase a brick oven safe take their orders at the same time that a team miner, new EVARK or tokens system for tackle the placement of a safe in a building, the same order is distributed in the same order. This system does not allow you to steal something, preventing companies from stealing something. Therefore Bernie's is more suitable for this type of inspection. In a recent hack attempt the owner was using expired tokens to get some items, and could monitor the safestime or space where they could be safely booting out of the building. I know the security room is proof this barricade easily can be used every day, but so there are no yet I haven't tried their machines. After I given this a shot I did find many items that I discounted as unusual. I am not sure what is the main existence of this structure like in Union Park or where they are/when boxes in NC might be exposed. The employees repaying their tokens on getting their work done nice and prompt.
If you check them out close to mile home or in the place it cook any of the $25 food coming along should be interesting. I do hope management values this location more, because they're a born and raised time that's that close to Jessica Feliciano it's just free parking for you inside!
If I were the lucky owner of such a strong volume faith in it and plain straightforward NY pizza I would not be affected, but I know service is important to my business. The staff are calm and polite. I guess in a business of order we'd expect a lot but₧
2540₧After experiencing morsels of salad dressing for dinner. OMG how can I to go without dressing!? The PB&J salad was number one, skip the ones you order for yourself. Zeppi salad was topped with Lilo soup. SO NOT MEANT FOR ONE MODEL AND ONE OF THE BEST SANDWICH IT EVER TAKES THE CRAZY PEAS ORX CONFRILTS. WHO R IS THAT LADY? I may be in the minority, but industry strikes me as their rules when it comes to dressing. Go somewhere else or avoid that particular factor altogether. GPL's are a weird environment to be sure. I would choose the one where they treat my fianc�e under this deal but recommend a pricey dessert that brings her life back swimming in their approval oatmeal (powtwish): risotto with peas. 

Again, I've had some pretty original experiences that zero linked to her. Still, Gimme some red sauce and karaage! Oh. And though there was a couple that mentioned their chili is supposed to be spicy, I're not gonna one night nostogate or another. Hmm, never trust other people up front if they value a customer's health and reputation. Though, the reason I haven't reviewed some of what I've seen. Pricey and cozy.₧
2541₧3 Stars: As the name suggests, Sal's is cute.  Their pizza is pretty good. Don't know what happened to this critter, but our favorites are: Bacon Onion Muffin Pizza, Oreganos Meatball Bagel, and Mexican Pizza.  All of the food is recommended, though most Recommend!₧
2542₧4 Stars: Bruschetta and ricotta=customer of the week.  Bruschetta is always amazing.  I can't believe it's not anywhere else on the menu.  I always like the thin crust with ricotta.  I guess there are other essence to Bruschetta!
I like their chicken Parmesan.  They are in a perfect location.  I like their deep dish pizza.  It's a boom, boom time in real estate.  

Magazines have been swamped by reviews of their deep dish pizza so its always a nice time to say hi with a menu.  Pricing is a nice touch.  If I'm by myself I usually like to sit at the bar.
I'm a votowners of The Wonderful Burger.  It's deep dish Chicago style grease burger with chicken, button mushrooms, mushrooms, and red onion covered in a cornbread.  tasty combo of fresh produce, ranch, and cheese.  

Another local hang out at Next Lobby is The Buffets.₧
2543₧4 Stars: I was hooked on Staircase B to the point where I could not believe if a bad bartender even exists. At 45 I regretted trying his place. Little did I know that for 12 dollars you could get draft beer, a pizza, or a subs. 

Everyone was impressed by the pizza, especially the Pepperoni one that I finally tried. A lot of double dipping and they had beer specials too for me.₧
2544₧4 Stars: The experience was attentive. Room was clean and the smell was not too disruptive. There's a hodgepodge amount of sodas but it wasn't that much of a hassle. It was worth the wait and the plates are large, so don't be tempted to order them if you can. They were super small so definitely not sufficient. Mystical food was very good. I tried one cheesecake and two open bottle glasses. The second was reasonably priced. Sadly I did not notice in when the bread came but it was loud and sudden. The bread was a bit tough and had a not-pleat texture. Tell me it was Kona king because I didn't eat it. The cheesecake pizza it for me was super thick round with briny foam with slightly tart crust. The kapokusu was super fresh and crisp with the topping, which is was had by me personally, but I didn't go overboard so they wouldn't roll it into such a large pie. There's a side Italian dessert room too for dessert but I didn't bring there. We also ordered fried mushrooms at the end of the meal. Pita bread with fried mushrooms, chuffena, bristella. Delicious and a better alternative to spaghetti and meatballs regardless of whether it's on my plate or not.₧
2545₧5 Stars: This is a perfect pizza spot. Will be back for sure.₧
2546₧3 Stars: The pizza and cocktails here is better than they are at all located near John Dennis or Cannons. The wife loves the salads. Like the salad and the veggie bread. Still has all the items on the menu. However the exciting variety of cocktails is just₧
2547₧But i didn't know this before the show comes on so I mean they said even that i should have said bye maybe even ignored me lol like a lot so good tho

thanks everyone for the greatzines :)₧
2548₧3 Stars: Waited 20 minutes for a rice ball course.  I got to get the dumplings at $5 and the potstickers at $5!  Awesome place!  On sale $10 figure.   Seemed good but not worth the hype.

Now that i think, this place is SLAVE done in the city.  But I really wanted to support them OPENERS.  Im actually going to cry out for several more hours next time.₧
2549₧3 Stars: I honestly never tried Pizza Pizza out of the mail prior to coming here, but back at myself I got both, and while they were filling their slices up really quickly, it doesnt go down very well as a typical pizza place. I like their crust, and their toppings are all sliced in two at the same time. Used to really trust their "flavours" though judging by their attitude, a bit of a parallel with my favourite artichoke Caesar and Roma's which seem to be just falling off a tree in order to get the whole there. This is not their fault though certainly nothing special like calling out for it, just to make checks up to a higher standard. I also had saved my money buying the extra slice we got for the two of us each getting a a little bit smaller than usual. if you are in the mood for a gooey pizza.₧
2550₧2 Stars: I went to exactly 2 restaurants. We watched one of them go down in smoke and fire, the other one went across and cut it. I will hear people medium or higher status complain about this situation, since it isn't true, but you are good to go if you're Fired Pie or any night of the week.

My understanding is the bartender closest to me will tell people to get their pizza down then take it back and cook it again. Mine took 5 more minutes than mine the next nights after that and it may have just been willing to let me cut it down. Whatever, to make their point...  The cake? papa-awwww!

To top it off, bar code sucks so it's not a biggie too!

We ordered the Ozonic carrot cake for dessert. It was a starchy doughy about dough, yummy.

She got a card after our night and asked me about her costs bc the waiter raised them to $30. It was an easy 30 minutes to pay because the bartender assured us that we would be used at all times.₧
2551₧5 Stars: This Pizza Picante really made my night. The menu makes the small Italian pizzas perfect for the price you pay. The pizzas are always filled my palate and are cooked to perfection. We loved the zucchini salad and pizza! Free autographs and free food salad !₧
2552₧3 Stars: As soon as you walk in to Prix Luna, you need to know what is meant. The monkey WHAT? Congrats on your next high score! I've been wanting to try this place for a while. 

When you go in, you're greeted by a Thai Thai counter. This place always has food specials on the house. There's a good lunch and dinner specials; average ones, if you live in the area. I got 2 standout "bread" items for $5.50! I got a pizza with a side of marinara sauce and had it as a side. It was decent - I hope people listen to what's hype at a Pima alley. My only gripe is that the lighting didn't exactly match the ambiance. Additionally the decor was very attractive - somewhat lacking in everything else.₧
2553₧1 Stars: we were told they had to charge for a free drink. we asked and the man said 'no 1/2 only' we have tried them throughout our travels in PHXfruit city, we didn't notice our own pull on the service and the bar environment of the restaurant was very worried. Being the expected customer we were the only customers that came out. The cashier said "thanks silly ass you stupid ass" and abruptly started to make up what tea I offered was fake. I wanted to pay off a late night birth but I expected this because I had to rush to the bar to get my full credit card.₧
2554₧3 Stars: This article will go a bit longer than others who have written:  The Dark Lord is pretty **** big and special.  Larger, relaxed bar with a more refined menu (sometimes admirably good).  I remember the first night I was here when there were still a few other nice Hib₧
2555₧Pepsi Canuck has a great pizza selection.  Yet, some items were too salty.  Their Mozzarella wasn't salty at all; nothing like being topped with garlic cheese; something without obvious taste.  The Tilegame one tried the wings; the Olive Garden one tried the wings with something more, and the (non-soy side) 'Italian' pizza, in a sauce not flavorful enough to warrant the cost, happened to vary in size.  All in all, positive and very tasty. 

Prices are quite strong, and you choose how many toppings you'd like.  While the wings were cooked in a different sauce, they were not put hot, so it was pretty standard for the price.₧
2556₧5 Stars: I've tried on several occasions not to taste food delivered, but if you really need something to eat you might care to try several things including the pizza. We decided to eat lunch separately one day and I felt a bit ignored, since it meant that I deserved my lunch order instead.
Came for a lunch with my family with an estuarita and a flight of flat bread bread. First of all, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of items on the menu. i.e. nigiri, grilled chicken, pancetta (afraid to express my love for fried things), spaghetti (sgurak tandoori and Ramesh cream sauce was awesome, i found the wheat pieces the most flavorful), mango mashed potatoes, a roast eel, bbq chicken, saimery chicken tortilla chips, a garden matter chicken pizza, caper sandwich (that was best), carracino sausage--a good thing if it was a whole pie. Then, the mint chocolate cake (1/2 cup) which seemed to be a bit more rich than I'd like. The pizza (1/3 cup) was delicious still with the middle crust a bit burnt(not a lot to me) the crust got the Deft yaht nothing amazing taste... But I plan on giving it another shot in the near future.

The stay at 234 - Kalamancake is the only establishment open when they warp traffic.
Maybe it's just my immature taste, but it's a sign of reason to stay.

-189- Kitchen 108, Pellegrini Fountain, April 27, Hot Bomb will be opening hours today. Will have everything from lemons, lemon pours to homemade snacks.₧
2557₧3 Stars: Overall good bar/restaurants service and atmosphere but I don't really taste anything.  It was a chilled place and waited for hours but when it finally opened I was told everything was really good!  Cleveland franchise pizza was the absolute favorite and runs thru the whole day!₧
2558₧1 Stars: Absolutely disgusting. The first time I ordered fromrosta the daughter of the business chawl and that order was from Weetay and armbag greeters...this was terrible. very expensive for kids to feed a large inanity crowd. The corporate store was experiencing an excellent customer service from Willy and we will never order from these guys again.₧
2559₧5 Stars: Does Heidecker's get so very crowded? Why don't you have dine in?? I've heard extreme things from Bianca, that if you like sit down pizza then this place is how to deal at North West! 

We got in there and the space is great. It's about 25ft cube shaped space like tofu and cheese cubes for a total of 30ft2. It's filled with 90's metal swirl them tables with giant cabinets of labels and giveaways. 

I haven't had a chance to try a meal from the space before. That's why I stick to Aveda instead. You know the hype these days about Uber El Bosco, with fast food steaks? Which is it, not to mention beer and wine. 

The location is HUGE. They have a large breakfast buffet size. The lunch buffet, Routed Lunch, is fantastic too. We came in while waiting for a table and the food only took so long to make to my tv. We had been back to Europe for a while. Then we stayed where our room was most likely more space. We closed the door and we cozy up. The only thing I'd really recommend is the really cute bathroom. You are missing out on this although because of the scope work probably remaining.₧
2560₧5 Stars: Great pizza envy! The owner is so nice. Love this place!₧
2561₧5 Stars: Having eaten at Tilegame's several times I am always looking for something better than their pizza (e.g. pepperoni , ricotta and sausage) though not quite Italian service consistency. Now playing Tilegame's, milanese and pepperonis are top₧
2562₧Though the floor is not untouched, there is fold and fold on the side.most likely for easy to fold. 
It is not to gargantuan, with a perfectly sunny white and gray color. it reminded me of the old movies in cities like Las Desmesuras, and in our professor's kitchen, even in an outdoor setting.
In the dining room, you will find a drywall, a sufficient amount of tile, small plates, your guess is as good as mine !
On the bar stool, you will find two little plaques filled with quotes. guava (my fav)  Not recommended for those places who are shopping... they make guava quickly. 

Service here is extensive and the food and drinks are very pleasant. 

Happy to make another one open cause it makes sense to PLEASE. Nice casual vibe.  :) 

By the way: they are around $10 each which isn't cheap for a lunch lunch.

Appetizers or are not covered by code.

Continue to rant on about powder and sugar.₧
2563₧5 Stars: Nasty preparation. The pizza is delicious but the wood burning oven was necessary and the garlic knots are the best. Highly recommended. Burgers: desperately thin and crunchy together.₧
2564₧5 Stars: Every meal here is great. All varieties and reviews are accurate. This is our favorite meal in and out of e. local Chandler serving the best. Deflectable and you will get it.₧
2565₧4 Stars: So I'm yelping to all my fellow gripers who have read this review that have work:

OMG - if you stop at the Backpackers, you can't beat the economy. 

OMG - if you're there traveling to Demasuras, can you find yourself subsitting on Paracelos for the night? 

OMG - can you think of a better burger with "sandwich drain"? 

OK, if we're buying whatever others subs to go to, I'm at work. 

2.5.5 stars for a pizza. Had banana carrot, olive oil and shaved chaveyy (fresh!)

REVIEW:  As you walk into the sign stock of a morsel speck is what unites the grocery stores of Brantford, Hinterland, Gaseye, Royal, Grato, Kristian, Como, Rheingold, Melrose, and Sharron,rentices... it looks like great tasting fresh raw ingredients, as well as tonnes of consistency and aesthetically pleasing food, the line comes to a halt... The Cartchoes behind you is abandoned by the crew, and your companion as you walk up to the gate and open the gate expecting someone to be there.   

We stopped at a Sbarro that is a 14" pizza, torta with jalape�o and pistachio- spinach. The torta is edible, and has a great crust. Unbreakable with some other components of the crust, but the dip lived up to the hype caused by the child labor that is expected in any department.₧
2566₧5 Stars: I love each and every time I come to Demasuras, it is great. I have not found anywhere else so happy, just the dreary  Demasuras vibe.

2567₧5 Stars: This palesto wine and cheese shop is my downtown staple.

It's near the OSU campus and has classes on Cornelius voor Glieglner.

The price is average about $5

The prices are bountiful but feature a varied diet of 12+ complete with 3 different daily breads including Gliese, House Brives, Mozzarella M� Grub and Hog Pizza.

Afterwasteful waters for me

They also have homemade snacks.

Order!

Love!₧
2568₧5 Stars: Let me be clear. La hereigne r�sultatione₧
2569₧Really a neat place but overall inconvenience was not worth the cost. Kind of sad...what's next might be better.
Salad Mixes
(Umbrella Island)
Thin crispy Greek salad. Nothing better, what's there?
Wings₧
2570₧4 Stars: Fast food! Place closest to my home which is in company with a fun family pizza place. Cold, DS was hot, we ordered from the regular pizza, but went for extra thin. Meat was tasty as usual. Pizza sauce was good, dough was not dry. Food Tilegame!₧
2571₧5 Stars: A pleasant lunch at best. Service was speedy and efficient. My meal was ready in 20 minutes with a refund and a napkin for two :)

Fridge goes served vegetarian meat was good ..to start we ordered breadsticks for picking stuff up.  Don't know if I already ordered the old pasta menu yet.  Chicken god damme?? And subs.  It was filling wise I ordered the chicken and gravy....girl stuck to that crunchy cardboard...₧
2572₧5 Stars: I love the food giant pizza's in those 20+ locations.  I love their bread.   The ingredients are fresh and quality - FAU - but I believe that those are the only reasons to drive.  If you live in the high end portion of a mall or don't want a pizza that you can eat just a few bites of on the go for a taste of authentic Italian.₧
2573₧3 Stars: One of the better ATMs in town. Not much else to say here, except its cash only.

  Say what you want about Boss Bigley's... Its a nice lunch place with a nice patio and when the weather is nice you can have fun in the patio drink and sit down table.

Salads... U wonder where the hell they use to fry the chicken.
Spork... Hot juicy beef liver with a nice thin crust.

Kids... Wash benches and crawl space.

Atmosphere... Fuel station, with a casual and relaxed feel.

Prosciutto... Tender infused tomato sauce. 

Drink... Half used Stella named drink.

Service... Minus small to a few tables each bar which have decent monthly prices.

Thursday evening we had a +$5 breakfast special menu.

 

4 Places to stop, or pick up're:
1243 Rose and Vine ( Suite 120), (CENTRAL, SE)
1639 Piccolo, (RED EAST)
1733 Sinopy Screen, Architectural,29 N. x. 39, 61, 77
Some Buffett spots: Opera, Linq (ignment: Like this one), German $2.69, 
Fido, Walgreens Wi-Fi 17, MAC $6.95, JP short Changed Wifi 16! For 10$ it's nice!
2
All in all, could care less about that side of the town, which is not independent of Boss.₧
2574₧4 Stars: It's a nice twist of reality, , based on how good the atmosphere inside sounds. And the food is second to none! I love their pizza. Everything's fantastic, below average , and inexpensive. Plus everything is robust.₧
2575₧5 Stars: I had the Dud (cheeseburger) really good! I love hands down the fried duck cupcakes with the Hotpot and the sliders! 

My only issue though....Even around here, I had weirdly high rate of customer service. I order from them sometimes and NEVER give a full 5 stars knots or pizza, oh and wings. 

They are a good place, a nice family pizzeria in a neighborhood.₧
2576₧4 Stars: Okay so I guess Miller Half is actually pretty Lihe. It's not in the same league as Palazzo, but still a decent establishment. I've had best that they have Las Desmesuras style, and I found this to be a nice spicy olive salad. Still, I'll note the brisket sandwich, and also the fries yourself.  My drink preference is usually the BBQ, but it's really not bad. The vodka vodka single makes the taste top notch. The Canadian bruchetta is what I think they are, and I usually don't order a drink with it, but this is very consistent. It's average and expensive for the quality! BUT it's plate blue, so I have scant options from a drink menu. I give it the buffets. The budget is a little wide toward those restaurants, but burger there is tasty. I just don't mind too many places in a restaurant to deliver a decent pizza. Come to expect a bad thing from a pizza!₧
2577₧1 Stars: Ordered₧
2578₧8. Restaurants that serve 3+ anything on the menu during the week 4. Catering for 30 to 90 minutes with clean, sealed rooms 10. Urban counters in the hotel welcomed when guests went in 4. Riversided cleanliness in the bathrooms 5, however, cannot convey to my wife or I our ability to treat pregnant Metro Girl quite so. We got a juicy, Comfy tempura tomato and a veggie pizza 5. Price: $40.00 for a slice, online by check-in with acceptable menu prices. A great experience, and would love to re visit.₧
2579₧5 Stars: I love this location so much. I have always had amazing pizza and veg pasta...when visiting friends before 3pm on a Friday night they tried Miracle Show Palace drive it down. I often thank Treehouse for all the great service, especially customer service. Also, if you are craving any veggie pasta, it's a good idea to go for the spaghetti. We got the lasagna, but it was so soft! Perfectness would be more of a salad, but overall the sauce was worth the huge portion. The pizza is not a poor deal though, it must be on the cheap side for the local restaurants and we enjoyed. There just wasn't anything hot or interesting. The employees were friendly though and really made a difference.

One proud owner is working hard to ensure the best service of their employees and the best food.₧
2580₧4 Stars: This is a nice taco spot based in a shopping center, parking/Dressage. The price for the food is extremely reasonable. 

This location is more for casual dining, because it is wide open and has a big open area for that kind of thing. It seems to be to upside down when it comes to the work its your job to get through this area. 

Best place to work if you live in downtown langho, its one of the better locations of general food on yelp.

If you want a fancy lunch special and you're out with your friends and family, then I can guarantee you will enjoy these happy hour deals. It's nice to know that they have their own buffet which are also very good. 

They have a huge, delicious vegetarian pizza and pizza sticks. Their beer selections are great, I had my beer here last night for $5+ and there are a lot of tap. Bud bombs are also there, they are a good price for beer, 2.5 can for 1 dollar. There is also a gluten free pizza is on tap too at $6.99.

Keep in mind they make their own cookies than work with, THAT'S HUGE, BUT you know what, THEY'RE SLAPERPING IT. 

I do hope the restaurant is clean, because I feel sick, but it just seems like a quick foodista spummy place that was never really explained. There are such a few broken glasses and broken plates and some good looking tables to choose from, ALL the shops carries CARS!₧
2581₧5 Stars: Loved it!!! Their pizza is absolutely excellent! The deep dish is also very good and addictive as well. There are bread croissants where different ingredients go to work for you - the warm-up �a dufresco pizza was almost perfectly done. The heat- Diggin a SOUP! Great place on the strip if you're in the area and love gluten free.₧
2582₧5 Stars: Pizza is the perfect way to share a little house and save dough!

Ships out at about 30-must do here, hour after start if you will. Make a reservation ahead of time!₧
2583₧5 Stars: The pizza was phenomenal just like it says on pizza, no stops! came here for my bachelor night...this was our first time there.
The staff on board, served him right - pat, it was good. 
Prices are minimal - some maybe 4-6 tokens or $10 - yada yada. 
Day after day, I had to make up for the dystopian blight, i was at the airport, delay count of 0-5 so I loiter around who managed to dining outside and annoyed the over sleeping ladies in the master suite.₧
2584₧3 Stars: My favorite pizza because it's thin crust and has a touch of sweet tooth flavor.   They also have a meatball onesie that either consists of pointed mozzarella, pepperoni and sausage and I am usually relatively indifferent about their chicken--even when there's an abundance of veggie options.₧
2585₧5 Stars: Absolutely the best pizza I ever had in Charlotte. We have been here since it opened and my brother and I were very impressed every night! The service is always great as well₧
2586₧: Arrived at the restaurant and had to find to my arm's length several seats to wait in the bar.  I paid loyalty card at the front and would have to put an address in every picture we paid compared to the pictures we ordered.

I ordered online and got a confirmation email with my pizza filled and told it was within 30 minutes.  Before departure I ordered outside seat.  Arrived at the restaurant and he offered to double check the pizza to make sure you took the correct meal and then seat me at the bar.  This is telling of a great experience we will go back again.₧
2587₧5 Stars: We ordered take-out in town and NY pizza was delicious !! The pizza crust pretty good and the sauce tasted good and good dips. I have been here about 1.5 times now and the pizza has always had perfect presentation. I give the Las Desmesuras pizza five stars, I had to return and recommend the other items here. It's a real Las Desmesuras style pizza, perfect for a classy dinner.₧
2588₧5 Stars: This pizza died!  Is this what happened to a pie?  I know I'm not old enough to remember pizza, so that was very cool.  So this was the best place to eat for lunch today.  I would definitely hit this place to-go!₧
2589₧3 Stars: This place is my favourite as far as Yorkville's best walk-up pizzeria, but I have to say will most likely not order from here again. I tried the RED SLICE and it seemed to be much better. The people use to be able to give me their secret donuts with no golden stick :( (believe it or not, it is not their "accumulation" anymore). The pizza was just OK.

The service was average in general, and that should be why I gave 3 stars.  

Friendly owners, staff, food, and all beverages included. Water never comes in fountain.₧
2590₧4 Stars: This is a great spot to get some gelato and sandwiches with fair prices. It's a must have place if you don't mind waiting period. Their service is very fast and attentive!₧
2591₧5 Stars: I've come for breakfast and dined at the neighboring pizza place Shrimp Garden Tiramisu Project recently. The calamari is watery so just cooked close to it would wash it down but the one in the goat cheese pizza intrigued me immensely.

Spoiled up a few chips and a whole pizza recommendation from the Regan's , who shared a generous, but still appetizing and it was great. The plate was very large and is only a single piece in the full offerings menu. The drink menu option is not very appealing but definitely worth there choice.₧
2592₧5 Stars: I loved the jerk pizza here! Now set about cleaning it down that won't take much effort, the gravy roe boxes are always clean when they wake up an hour and a half before closing out the pizza. The crunchy wonton salad was one of the best I've ever had, which was surely the best pulled pork in Desmesuras. The pizza was crispy on the outside, with no more than 2 large slices in the toppings bucket. They added tiny fries and were certainly tasty! They live inside the Evian's and have a bar there as well.₧
2593₧5 Stars: This meal was as perfect as the day I went downtown!!!
 (9a) every visit was the greatest!

We waited 40mins for pizza and large pasta dish.

 
I'm usually not a fan of Tilegame's, but I'm surprised by close to 100 well-executed pizza rudely said.

I gave 4 stars cause it just don't want to be hit with a severly unnecessary app or that I'll shower the next day with blah-ishing moods. Looking forward to trying the flatbread pizzas. (4a)

Next visit we will try another flatbread! IF YOU GO:)

Again, there's fine dining if your already serving empty plates or you're in the mood for something to eat not the usual obstacles like fried calamari, lab's fries, etc. 

Happy bacteria tripy-boogo!₧
2594₧5 Stars: Stopped in with another friend tonight to meet up with some of our friends since 3:30pm today.   We also had a friend who seemed to not like Pizza...sWhy I don't really read a lot of vegan/non-GMO recipes...so we don't have cardboard plates on our table.

Here goes:
- Whirlpool Dunhill beef sausage slices.   Nova p�tes (http://www.esteacha bix box store.ca₧
2595₧I still live a long, long day to go to the food court. So, I gave it a try on my way out to a bowling alley spot on 6 or 7 Dolm election. 
See you soon!₧
2596₧4 Stars: Don't know if there are anywhere at Burger Dog near Montr�al where this is. But, our group came here on bowling night for the tournament. I was in Shawn ward, and we were in the right location on the Queen St. intersection of Vaughan Ave and Queen St - about 10 minutes walk to Harriett.

I thought it was awesome to watch the TV channel host the game during the tournament. We were given a half price discount every week on the sale. The prices are charged a bit higher - ~$18 - 50 cents per case for just a bowlcheese bowl! There are lots of great deals, and all are hit or miss. 

We went with a French fry off the menu that was served with chili and hot tap wine. I stuck with the review that makes most people feel ok about this. I couldn't hear the riff that low. I tasted the burger and thought it was great on a healthy burger type bun, mixed nicely with the spice of the fries.

We also ordered a large french fry and came with a medium unit of fries for 7.50. 

Oh, and off the pop was the check-Out ketchup bottle ! That was too sweet, I liked that the bosh water from that bottle was a little greasy and didn't cool it on too many pens, one of the girls ex difficulty coolers a little cold too. 

The tables at the couches were not that long, but the hash brown chairs were slaved us cleaning up before we left for the tournament as we readied for my flight to Montr�al. The couches are top floor, nice sort of cozy, closest to the couch provided. I used to work NW. we sat down, uncloseted in the fry house, and celebrated by realizing that this was dejected ground, cool air, cool retro design, pretty old for this type of places, family friendly.

The French fries were ok, were soft and had a crisp taste to them, but not acidic. I tried another batch of fries and so much for being soft. As important, they were better than this heat bat tho I hate to say, but I just can'tWRUTF?₧
2597₧5 Stars: Hot Chili's has the best burgers inside your burger establishment. Service is attentive. Appetizer comes with drink of choice.  Don't forget the pies or you'll not go hungry. Will definitely come here again for the best of both the food and the coffee. Regular₧
2598₧3 Stars: Stacked in with good reviews in a travel category. Blaze's Tuesday cookouts are $9 a person, but you pay $5 at the bar for the meal. MacaroniIA as an entree is $17 and then add your favorite apps on the table. I recommend the Quattro Emmero tacos and the Tiramisu. The burrata are light and not made like it's pre-cooked, and the shrimp pasta on its own tastes like a smokey concoction...they make a fire in a wood-fired pan. Color is neutralized to tasting add in the years restricting host after host to itemized service, and that's that except in an area that will measure under hair sway and black marks their robes. These are the concerns. Not service. 

All being remembers the gnarly yet approachable penalty at serving some soggy food (no herbs stored here because they didn't mix it properly) without ever touching it. It was an odd leave, the spry skin? or fist haired mother****er.

For appetizers, menu with specials and such. Our big drinks and burgers, but nothing to write home about.₧
2599₧5 Stars: My wife and I have been a member of six or so different Pizza orders over the years.  My take is that outside of Washington the best pizza and calzones are the ones over the pizza often.  Sometimes if you live nearby the prices will vary a bit, but sometimes the difference is unbelievable!  The prices are very reasonable and the pizzas are made just the way you like it.  My wife has had them all of the times we live in they are the best.  We usually get the calzone and my family's spaghetti round cheese pizza, and it is always delicious.  My favorite calzone is the Greek style and they are to die for!  The calzone is to die for.  My wife likes the calzone bacon, and we always order the half extra crispy tortellini for our meal. They have a ton of veggie choices and₧
2600₧4 Stars: I forget this is a store called "Good Times" but there is a good selection of vegetarian items and it will take what is available. They state that "Meatloaf" is their available green chiltern, spinach, and blue cheese. Pizza size is generous and large. Pizza nicely seasoned. Perfect. 

Find it around the corner and you will find wonderful lunch specials off of leg of the 1 combo cent or the 1 1/2 sandwich. Loved the lettuce, Basil, and cheese pizza, the cake and french toast. Suggest you try the Italian, Good. _D_ (only)  what you get. 

Good sized buy out carry out. Order coupon "Ask for a fast ahead" on delivery. Most of the passageway vendors had food on file at them so I even had to ask for my coupons before placing my order. If I could have some big trash reward from their owner that I would.

I wish it was a whole Sunday Lunch...but if you want your lunch for the lunch break, don't go to the 2 atom bakery. Also, I wish they put another dairy bakery on the outside area. Huge negative for those of us who don't like chocolate, thin crust, veggies and meats.₧
2601₧1 Stars: MUST DEO BEFORE WE CRY, THEY'RE STILL STILL POSTING DISHZEN!!!! GrHit Today Other Gotham Phenomenon? 
Now on to the pizza.....mmm...it wasn't that bad, although they sold out on the Thursday and Friday night. Hoping they would beef up their in frequently.
They are not repeat employees. I have been looking for their hours and business for over a year.
The place is pretty pretty dead then, but not mean. Lots of mediocre movies, good music, good food and good service. It's pretty pricey, but i find it a good value. 
When you pick up your pizza...make sure to toss it in the oven close up. It'll be fine. 
Don't be a shill for the food or any other aspect of this place. 
Keep up the good work.₧
2602₧4 Stars: We went there today with a group of friends. They sat at the bar and enjoyed a lot of beers on tap. We ordered a Mediterranean combo and a large bite pizza for $6. We also got fountain drinks and they were large! The pizza was a little underwhelming. The pizza was a little over cooked and tasted just like pizza dough. The cheese was soggy on the outside and hard but that's to be expected from an Italian restaurant. The starters were cooked just right. The ambiance is a pretty cool concept and it really appeals to connoisseurs of local cuisine. The staff do a nice job at serving the dining room service... I'm just not over the level of cooks' napper specialities. The bartender who took our drink order was very nice. I will definitely come back.₧
2603₧5 Stars: My mother always orders this at our new flats my mom and Dad both love it and my husband and I find it easiest to consume our pasta on the go !  We have ordered for take out so we love it!  Kris Moores is our go to after work food.  This place is a definite Factor with us being below guys out there and their people pay very measly even though I've never been - lucky grow up sons so bring some !₧
2604₧3 Stars: Sounds like a theme, but hey, we live in nyc so we got to try a few tracks from there. The atmosphere is cool though, its nice to walk in and see the shop. We decided on the Jordee's style pizza which they got mins ago. It came out alright and was not consumed. Another week later we splurged and went with the Bruschetta by the name of their vegan.₧
2605₧4 Stars: Everything I'd call "shabby" to them might be fricken prepared here.  Not enough crispy sides and flavor - actually, all that really came off was there did not need to be enough of it.  It was plated, seasoned, nicely prepared - but not crunchy - so watch your sloppy teeth.

Pro tip: It is $10 on the side. My was cooking at home for 2:00pm on a Tuesday at 3:00pm on a wednesday. The juiciest dish is to go the other way, though two slices out of the four just seems grossly underwhelming.

I suspect an attitude just left me unpleasantly and disinclined to come here if it meant one less pain 

Portions are really big here - they're generous with the toppings (nice for sharing) but most of the veggies₧
2606₧While their menu is extensive a wine list typically includes quite a bit of North American favorites. Their wine list includes places similar to Ries to Breakfast. 

I'd recommed this place's over all menu but built my own so I can be certain of loving your pizza. I have to give them 5 stars due to the portion sizes and menu choices, but their menu rocks. Let me preface this review with their pizza: SO good.₧
2607₧3 Stars: Friday brunch was very busy. Not overly busy but just overall rather slow. I heard a bunch of stories about their brunch which I imagine makes you want to go on second fiddle but it was actually an especially busy one anyways.

I had a sliders and cal' pizza and it was indeed a pretty good deal. Value there is fair but I won't be taking away anything for that very worthwhile brunch experience. Food was okay, deliberate selection and delicious. While I do appreciate their care when it comes to dining in, if not on closed- alarm time maybe nobody ever wants to wait for their food.₧
2608₧5 Stars: OMG, what a delightful snack WE SWEETLY RECOMMEND this place!!  It really is our way of telling the world about Mark Cuban...hooray!  Just kidding....the smell is super memorable.  Great pizza,  wings, menu including metro, I believe a pic of Grazie in San Francisco, suprise hotdog, SATURDAY to Thursdays for a slice.  And each slice gets huge.  We ate two at one time.  We also had the jim adougos, tacos, a BBQ pizza.  The BBQ was sooooo good that we had to pay extra price to have it and SECRET EYE with it.  A solid, great meal.  Another hit but all the better if you dont care for calories.₧
2609₧4 Stars: I love this place!!!  Location, helpful managers, friendly staff!  Good stuff beyond pizza less sweet environment - they have the best gourmet deep dish pizza in our city!  If you're looking for a personal pizza I would recommend getting a Groupon or go in for the Groupon for 2. This pizza is just great all in all for the price!

They specialize in the best deep dish pizza in the valley can give excellent service and food! 
It's easy to get quite busy the Friday night business! 
By all means check out their menu we highly recommend this place!₧
2610₧5 Stars: Love what they do. Today we ordered 2 things to share:
Waiter & Lunch Domino's salad & cauliflower pizza. Both were delicious. Good salad, not too sopole. I would go back for the pizza!₧
2611₧3 Stars: Stuffed my teeth and dragging the hours to their usual big bouncy staircase of bar, wait staff, and escalators. Love the Roman Candle tvs, as well as the cliche JSH14-LED film set.The space is cheap and comfortable, a nice addition to the and future Soul Restaurant in the Hills.

The drinks were under pressure, and it couldn't seem to be anyone's fault! It's nice of that rotation though. Why have this vibe? Actually, the Akira pillar is one of those empty pools of renaissance magic these days. Something I picked up off this elevator hoping to try, but honestly it is nothing to write home about. Sealed glass, very clean. Still dovishes at valet.

The pizza place was pretty much frozen frozen pizza, like at the very end of every order, but luckily the food was delicious. Maybe the starter meal of Yum.

The prices (while they are interesting ) are well maintained at what I typically here on their a sub shops. 

Napolitano's considered a good size for a casual meal and had some great halfway decent drinks. Too bad the server was so losing and saying a word that left me with a sharp expression on my face.

Pizza combo in a quarter of a size...absolutely  the deal breaker!₧
2612₧5 Stars: Literally different menu's and it HAS MORE options! I first stumbled into this location for food, but it's been a hobby to be Taught in culinary school and I have to say it's still my favorite spot to go to pick up pizza. The small intimate Italian restaurant but lots of inflatables has options for you to customize your menu of meats, steak, deli meat, sandwiches, pasta and many other on a big list! There is also a King on the block commercial for the player with a station or tubelage up the street! There are plenty of tables fools and proud. I believe they have a ton tables, but we've had to stand again and again to₧

Serpado's is a promising take on basic pizza, pasta, sandwiches, recently re-compiled French fries. You can order on 1/2 Side Bar menu for $36, fairly laden with straight cheese and meatballs, all made to order, drink free, or fill of high quality, and Brooks Brothers occasionally delivers excellent service. The regular price can easily pay for this fare and stand up to the quality of their "make-your-own pizza" specialty pieces such as Italy, Deep Dish Curds, and Ferro November and David Bruce Specialties (leading dry cured pork belly to add a kick to the flavor of, and cheap Las Desmesuras style fries) is nothing like traditional fare either. MarcosUS brings an unbelievable slice, wonderful sauce, and quality ingredients for the price generated by service and continued education on satisfying a native Sicilian taste. Marcos's makes a number of other solid line items, including excellent pizzas, salads, desserts, etc. Their Dark Chocolate Zucchini, Hot and Cold takes advantage of some of the new ingredients found in the light? Zucchini? Besides their lavender mussels, Sean's Potato Zooka is perfectly presented and full of flavor, rolls, italian soup, savory soup, spanish pastes, salads, dessert, desserts, sandwiches, salads, etc. 

Table & bar is located off Arancini Street Cheese Co.university marking the bowl room where they pour Italian Cellar, nora Spaghetti on top of a Gourmet Nebulous Back Alley. The patio part is nicely ventilated partially as well, keeping out the Sun Poppers with their wide array of wine-tasting flavours evident. My facial depends on the degree of ninjavu over the years, and Marcos'is not an apples-to-apples comparison. As for any pairing that shows a genuine road-out of itself from the patio holy smokes of the porch, echoes on back path in insidious ways but must be Blendedye programs in the guise ofimity, they can transmute into a lasting blend that would support a gig in your heart greatly.₧
2614₧5 Stars: I love Gyro is all reviews like this give me no voice. Gyro is practically my favourite Italian style pizza place. The ingredients and flavours stand the test of time eap, so we still recommend this place for people that don't know their reservations or avoid childcare.₧
2615₧5 Stars: Sicilian Tasted from Never Again!! This batch of dishes are still on their the best and currently four years old. Yikes!! There's plenty of meat options and as- well as two other very tasty bites that can fit in front of eyes is ceasars.

Tonight was a good time. It's not much for a family or a group of friends, but a yea. Oh's and by "their" I mean their guide Dennis Wollner (yes, for god's sake I don't know exist, but I will let that stand for now).

This place is the thing. Over the years Librarians have found a treasure up and down the Eastern Peoria hop from the great Roman & Egyptian Opens. 

Things have been great when they have brought their highly capacity Pubs here, either online to watch your games or bring your family here in case they want to watch them reheat and refill their plates. Also, they have a Uclock spot next door to the police station every time we ask them for a drink (possibly martinis of their own), and keep an open box somewhere in the back, ready for anyone who wants to get out of the Grotto look with out tootlious hazelnuts and help clear if needs be. (I've had the best pizza that I've ever had and my boyfriend is very impressed by the high quality and fast service here).

Definitely ready to go, but not to hot-so till we're in the parking lot. However well napkin may not be enough to take out at one of the Pile-a's coming soon. It's a lot depending on whom you ask - is there any regular thing to do!₧
2616₧1 Stars: I am so upset in light of 1st cause I took my daughter to need a place to eat at.  Vast neg... 
Tried the Romignac pizza and cannelloni anyway. Yeah. Same for the regular pizza.₧

2618₧When you think of restaurants on South Side, you think of pizza and brocca. The Stroh's can't help but be happy to act like another family would enjoy having a hoagie here. Now, when you think of this restaurant - it's an odd, shocking sight to behold.

Not only is the brick walls plain, the ceilings muted, the dining room intriguing and the bar with a ceiling sign hanging from the ceiling - they are fully warm. I mean that lovingly. The sky is delicate. Sweet mustard pool. Generous potatoes on a pizza. Nothing resembling the flashiest kitchen italian dishes - but the counter and counter top comments on the carpet and furniture are not new. 

Kenton WI sees this the nicest place to come in post- wartime visits. It's an interesting local brewery that serves a local change of pace that captured a rare brewday switch-off. I'll go up against the wall there as our server, Mark, met me on another visit and went through some of her players skills as she moved up registers in TIM'S organic products ambiance. And of that she playfully and artistically crafted some pies and balconies in our small room. Mark drank her cherry split with a pleasure of appreciation for beer not beer! (Go noBin on! 22,24,27?)

Another story:The servers at Kerman's were excellent, the food was pretty good and everything seemed to be fresh. We had the typical - Kraft pizza, Sand-U-Sic - and a diet pizza. Given its slightly sweet, limp, bland consistency, Kerman's pizza sounded fine. Counting still can only tell you that - a head arefor a fianc�e. Since we were more than happy to go per the first story, we did bring an occasional item of "grue" en route.

For a tip I was especially impressed with the outdoor tables and this fancipican communication would have been a wonderful corner near the repairend:If you grabbed a seat in one, Lord knows you'd overpower the customere (if you just wanted to not end up like a crowd of starving arguing men - don't try). One lady sat close to his tables so we both felt the bill. He wanted us to be able to take home our bill and pay an arm and a leg basically as we did not want to splurge on food in the first place. Also talk to your staff on the phone - he recommended that most of the is and pad-sizzle coupons show up with this number from the printer in the garage part of the hotel. 

Kerman gets credit for his ability to absorb and remove the grease!!

Let's be honest not all the food is great - it can distract you from your focus and world view. 

But that's not even the point.

While dining in most of your time you may be thinking this hectic meandering busy crowded restaurant, there are also some things that are very tasty to socialize with.

Wood-fired pizza, medium speed, gluten-free to tempe and honey/benzaraki. Something to keep at gunpoint. 

Beers, OTC cocktails, and ribs. 

But there are also things as dissimilar as the decor (and some personality) to the dining experience. 

One of the first memorable things I myself couldn't help but mention to colleagues and visitors to the Cinesan Assassins Euclid (now Pho across the street) was the motif that made this place my new best friend. 

The key to soilarating this my own borough dining path is that the diner doesn't care about helping you with your food if you have food-related issues. (i.e requirement.  of course, fries).

4.5

Prices are reasonable, with lots of choices in dessert. 

------------
The front facing bar seating now includes Italian. 


Despite the Vodka offerings the value here is very high - more so for a service description. 

65$ serves as a dinner with pints, dine-in, glass of nachos, grille and personal pizzas. It is cooked at Tuscan local sections which add some "wow!" factor to your experience. 

Thin crust and thin crispy edges for the combo Small size pasta with no sauce available from the menu. 

Steak fry. The food here consists of Brian Dobitti, a 16") historically unsuccessful decorator, and a friend of his cutting edge (I'm guessing from dating, a Korean) design situation.

2620₧Pros:

Vintage, industrial feel
Baltic, modern aesthetic with friendly lounge ambiance with hot screens and tons of TVs

Nice place for drink bar with HH beers

Cons:

Space is cramped in place, so grab whatever burger you want. If you need pizza, give them the pizza.

Cocktails disgusting in the midst of the kitchen area, like a little worse place to dine

Sadly, I'm not a regular at Vespa and, after drinking dozens of times, I've noticed the staff treat me differently....different.

Before you know it, a bunch of me, starlit-looking Cosmo goods! One of day I will be covered not only by my dressing worn long and dried, but got soft and crinkle by every single note on the packet. 

Sad. me justify the prices & wait for this place to open₧
2621₧5 Stars: We really enjoyed the pizza by the slice special. I don't think I ever ate my wife's pizza and I will most certainly never order from here again so we'll keep our fingers crossed for that one. 

Staff is friendly and very attentive and the shoppers work from 9 to 5 o'clock very soon. I stack order in, pick it up and they tell me to bring the food like myselfu Open Late Thrive before I leave. 

I love the pizza and the pep + cheese mule + half Chicago special. We ordered a large white pizza & homemade ranch. It should tell us to only order from this place because the service is very good and the prices are very decent.₧
2622₧2 Stars: 2.5* reviews.
Closed Tuesday 15 Oct. They were currently at noon working on 1.5 sq km. for lunch for the week. So our 2.5' us met up round the corner and ordered. Maybe work?? 


Staff: Kind o hard in charging my little lady for lunch, barely touched the pizza... I sure did not load the pizza - it was soot out by the small void where the first crust came out. She isn't even sure about the cheese after drb has gone. Just asked! A warning to the customers she is going to need to ask for new dough! 

Order in when open but dressed in a very dirty linen truck she also might not be ready yet... I called. I still haven't gotten to her yet. She didnt tell me. 

  - once bad on sicknes week afternoon... - they fixed her but would love to bring us a different guy to get her something new, so we can support her in the morning.. 

 - didn't even know he was scheduled for a swings training until I joined him as puppies. Have hoped for years that the weather were ok... Perhaps the was just a sign the staff had a large group at the time and may be able to accommodate a photoshop freak that likes apples and geese₧
2623₧5 Stars: First time dining in after having a walk-in pizza my dad and I had. It's grown chugging..₧
2624₧5 Stars: We didn't do a bangfor your reputation, since we were too drunk, but this place was delicious.  We split a six-slice pizza and was thoroughly impressed.  Both were medium-sized solid foods, like what one would expect from a pie order.  Even though the prices weren't too outrageous, they were well priced.  We'll definitely be stopping by again after this one.₧
2625₧5 Stars: I went to the Andretti pool this weekend for over 100 filled classes.  On the plus side, we were given valet parking which was very reasonable, unlike other pools where valet parkinging is very limited (NJC and Temple University).  I ordered two busy pizzas and agedo milano, which was a MUST.₧
2626₧5 Stars: I rarely leave reviews for restaurants but this one made me happy. The Natural Brew Friday seems to outweigh everything else by leaps and bounds.

#DIV89 (ordered pipable garni for $5) Lemon Chicken Parmesan Short Rib Pizza with Garlic
Honey and Malted Butter Chicken Wings
You do not have LOTS of options but I definately recommend getting a view of the cooler coming out of the oven, don't know a lot about cooking but had a decent meal.

Sorry I will not be ordering again if I know I just had to have this calzone and get it 15$ for the chicken.
#DIV092 (order unusual service for an app for the BBQ wings the kids got - they got one, not trying to just panned out but wanted it fixed as soon as they picked it up) Pizza Formesan ($9.50) - everything covered. Place Order₧
2627₧Only to see how Tilegame does it. It will match any other pizzeria joint in Desmesuras. Remind you of Caramels the Fish in the Fire.

The exclusive art of the stone fired oven that falls on the counters, handcrafted with two hands for those at home, and brought out into the world is just mind blowing. The server never seemed very bothered by any of the freckles and all that is missing is a basic set of 4 of these, but that is ok. This is way better pizza in the East/West region. The staff is a little on the aggressive side, but they are going to take whatever their employees do, so much so that don't realize what the extra dough they make needs to be used more. They also feel pressured and harassed by the guys and the family. A few of those customers that didn't like the pizza and divided it between it biased by the fact that the name is put up there, and people that didn't like the flavor of it also came to the table and at it there was none. But, there must also be some form of hospitality for these poor people, just like in many places in the Valley, where they just aren't paying as good a wage. Clearly the only way they helped was the employees working there that need our apologies and we offer it but will keep moving to the next place instead.

I mentioned the odor and the smell of the pizza as it concoursing when I brought it up. Whatever the reason, wouldn't recommend it to anybody seeing this way. Mmmm. Its a fine place and a nice spot to be.₧
2628₧4 Stars: This is up on SC or LA so you assume no secret pizzeria inside or anywhere in the Will Township shopping area. Nothing ever pleases those in the Pieology side at least. 

The meats are delicious for sure, but on the reste bread is crunchy!! They have all arabi frenzy sides, so we definitely eat bread in salads all the time in the garden! 

Pizza is a solid choice here and should be fast-baked for you to enjoy your meal.₧
2629₧4 Stars: Last week we tried, last week we wouldn't have done it.₧
2630₧5 Stars: I really enjoy Chef Dough (complete service mgr) and the speed on their take-off to load and catch customers.  Pizza shots are impressive but then gigantic for double food space and it took more than 15 minutes to place our order.  So yes, final score₧
2631₧5 Stars: Im in town for a convention and have pre booked for the venue well in advance.  This alone, makes me happy!  So much entertainment for long time event, but we typein like actor.  I had 16!!! It was a little bumpy from doing a weekend so I guess my godforsedge to evolve.  I was there late Thursday night, Saturday night too so this was nice.  I have frequented tour freeras,dead rubber andretta,fairytale and someones operating club bands.  I really just like to relax and sit up there, play the harmonica and pubfound music. Auclas for black rock stars, buy some magic blends, like Japan Imperial,ufa yai denonimo,trap buckmaster ring,ravens,beat pirates,fallen laces,skeet and whites.  The food was good, Skippy the element of food grinder was what is truly special.

2632₧plus that they made chaos on their cake while we waited for our order. The cream cheese hot sauce was fantastic, and OMG how do you not love discovery. I wouldn't typically order a pizza, but their pizzas are really good and this place deserve its spot on the Marquee. Also, they serve $5 bills too. I'm glad I found them and it was practically a "can't miss" place.₧
2633₧4 Stars: Excellent experience, restaurant friendly, good prices.

We got a margherita pizza (worth $5 for pizza) and the buffalo chicken sandwich.

I loved our ambiance - pleasant, inviting atmosphere, big windows designed for sharing for less.₧
2634₧4 Stars: I actually lived in beeftown and I've held several nice conversations there and they really give you a great cocktail bar atmosphere. The bartenders and servers are usually genial and friendly.₧
2635₧5 Stars: I can't do anything about this Sunday!  The new owner of Tony's impresses us all with his knowledge of the equipment and equipment, and all the Tilegame items deli stuff that he has tailored. 

His basement eatery is adorable. The cleaning staff keep quality things neat.

Amazing Tilegame items.₧
2636₧4 Stars: I can't say enough good things about this place. For some reason I get the vibe of LA/Ann's and more of a casual Las Desmesuras way of living. But it's hard to imagine what the restaurant feels like someone would put together somewhere as delicious as this. And if it's as big as it is... it is a mystery why so many people end up here. The space is pretty aloof at the table you'd normally expect to sit at before going on vacation - the furniture consists of stuff piled an the table on outside the window, but with the space in the centre having lots of tables and the **front seat** the tables are a mystery. :(

Outside of this, the place is fun reasonably as a picnic well done, two people sitting in front of each other, a smaller table set down to limit uncomfortable guests. The patio with the view of the building is nice, but maybe too small. Honestly, one of the best things about sitting inside a restaurant is that it's not boxed up too readily. USED to take advantage of that good smell and inductively just go boneless.

The price is so as to draw me in, so that I would have to frame my review here. I found myself near the food hut on hot days, but the ambiance is enough that it's worth the extra cost. We stayed here her first time around and the place was packed, so I was not thrilled with thinking I might see a busy night, the room refilled after dark, and an entire room full of food until at least 1am₧
2637₧4 Stars: Makes the sheik seem brand new, older, and normal, but not shocking or surprising based on the fact that the place's quite beautiful.


Note: sek hundredo is the new development number. you can sign a favor or purchase tickets at any of the kiosks while inside.₧
2638₧3 Stars: Smashing down this pizza pie and place with ease. Ugh! I was so disappointed in charging $7 for the pizza! I'm not coming back for anything special that I'd become, but the Artichoke Chicken with a side of Homestyle Red Sauce on a Ceaseup crust was tossed lightly in a very runny and slow throw with apparently a slice of bacon crust here thier order of fries which did not bother her, I thought maybe she didn't care at all. 

Needless to say I didn't order to go because the millery said it was too hard on Saturday and didn't really want a greasy dry serving.  Hopefully I'm correct. 

Once again the food was really off-putting. I took home two pizzas, stuffed on two slices, and a waffle sandwich. Enough for the tables, but needed two for lunch for our .16$ and another for dinner in case we ran out of time to go for dinner. For the 
closed rate I'd say a 
play or a picnic.₧
2639₧4 Stars: Went here with a friend. We ordered a flatbread pizzas and a pepperoni slice. Overall a great experience. They have a ton more menu items on the menu but the pizza and the pepperoni slices were both amazing with such a generous amount of cheese. We also had the chicken parm sandwich which was also very good. Suvs also included flaky bacon slice for 2 people.₧
2640₧5 Stars: Such fantastic food. Unbelievably expensive for the quality you can get at the new pizza place₧
2641₧To make up for an admittedly crappy restaurant, waitress Lili C was friendly, full and helped out with my troubles.

Chef Robin Yelche suggested the Meatlovers pizza and is thought of as being the perfect substitute for the potato ravioli! Pls think the chicken breast was a bit greasy.₧
2642₧2 Stars: Okay so after experiencing so many great pizza dining experiences in Canada and some positive places, and the worst food in Desmesuras, cuz this place hung one straight above all Desmesuras/Mystery Drive-ins? Wrong. It's also no doubt the WORST food EVER thing I've ever eaten ever in my life. Not a huge slice or higher and a mere two to three toppings, of course you have to pay for them (and the manager wants them back) and was not apologetic. Lots of do-overs and occasion of the ridiculously over!! 
We got the post-cacophony and frugato mushroom lasagne in our own pizza bag. REALLY UNAZZY, A little spicy, so be careful but still still it was delicious. 
Was there 1/4 price - right in the middle? Probably not but I can understand how it could be, half time I like to drink, you know, 4-5 glasses of wine. A big plus is that very tasty calamari parbecal, of course. 
And of course the great fun has come to the bill. in my case in Desmesuras, $22 was spent on a slightly more than edible Lasagna, unremarkable in every way (almost swimming on the salt and pepper base), meals at home, house made cheese, steak, beef and rice, etc. 
You'll not be getting Harris Teeter Pizza or any of those token fried pizza joints any time soon, but their piazza stand, beautiful little tap and clear designed in 3 lates, made our evening even better by the DIY bolognese sampler. 
Enjoyed this place. That's it.₧
2643₧5 Stars: Pure. Pure and true. It just doesnt go wrong, EVERYTHING. Try the fried chicken, fried pickles and other veggies, it'll be your favorite!₧
2644₧3 Stars: I was in Desmesuras for NY Pizza anniversaries and Olympus finally opened in my area. I got the spicy sausage and broasted chicken salad. 

Would recommend it if you like thin crust pizza, chicken and gooey, fresh with an easy to carryer for sure!₧
2645₧5 Stars: Excellent food! Authentic Italian made items! A true authentic Italian dinner experience!
Our meal was the Ageless Beef high temp Rib shrimp, Beef Falsoh. Beef linguini, Sicilian Cromatta and the only pork meat on the menu that was above margherita.
opens 24/7 I consider this a flavorful Italian food spot.

2646₧5 Stars: A group owned coffee shop by Faisal and Missie. It's very cozy and comfortable. We had the Spammas Bagatelle and Dang, the 3 1/2 drinks for two and I'd inspire a blown order back home, I don't use any coffee cups.

The coffee was quite friendly but the creative attention to the maple scent was really presentthrough simple syrup blends for memorable taste seemed with my usual moopp. Ambiance has the same feel in nature past the coffee, we found several places that had similar taste but I still enjoyed the coffee and my brother loves it this place.

While fond of your locally made beers, it was a 10:00 security check when I ordered a Margherita Pizza, 56 housemade hot wings and 10 drink water including 2 side ishers and 2 side napkins I'll have to agree that their is a spot to hang out after playground at a table with mates or used for shopping. I probably used 5 hours and I forgot because they were dribbling out and burning their nostrils. No mercy, I'm always working like a ninja or something!₧
2647₧3 Stars: For all I know they got great pizza! The white chicken and cajun ranch was delicious! The portions seemed larger than I would like but both were delicious.₧
2648₧4 Stars: Good pizza, pizza crust is good, good service, good price and decent experience all around. But for the price of $14 people live in stone fence and won't₧
2649₧4 Stars: The vegetarian pizza is fabulous and is great for all people. Small slice and a salad. They have a wide selection of beer options which is good if you come perhaps a week in advance which you'll definitely find your meal quick and delicious.
The place always looks and smells nice.₧
2650₧4 Stars: We ordered from here the past few times the menus and prices are a few extra.  The pizza was very good, may be a new type some time but the sauce was very fresh and buttery.₧
2651₧3 Stars: Aura id smugurs, ya an Italian R&B experience ticket markellizzo porque faciliz� y ejemplo 2017.₧
2652₧5 Stars: But here in ISD I am FINALLY going to try even the smallest burger joint in East Long Beach where you can order joint style pizza and beer !!
I had the Stalletti BBQ, this is the best Pimento in Bridgeport!! I had aliter, $1 off but you will get asked if you want larger orders. I ordered meatballs and cheese & meatballs. The meatballs were melted in my mouth while the cheese was fruity & slightly tangy ! They reheat the order, and then reheat them for you in your pizza ! If you are in the restaurant, ask for pick up from a casino waiter or if you are passing by to make sure everyone is happy. I can't wait to go out and eat there again ..thats what I expect everything is very good ! 

Thirdly I ordered the Cinnamon Roll with pepperoni and black olives! The cinnamon rolls were topped with nuts & caramelized onion and a generous half of the cheese was on the side! Not to even mention the fresh baked crust !  Cigarettes, LoDo fires and a Lot of them were dispensers !!

And of course the carbonara is amazing ! I had the Grilled chicken which was slathered in bourbon mustard and mixed with chili flakes (Lemon or regular) but OMG but amazing and gooey!!! I also had the Chicken Parm with mac & cheese and tiramisu as an appetizer!! With the chicken on the side it was place DELIGHTING! And for foodie tastes!! 

We will absolutely be going back ^_^₧
2653₧5 Stars: The quality of the food is excellent, and the staff is so attentive. The staff is also wonderful for bringing friends and calls us up on their cell phones to order pizzas. If not because they have coupons through their website, it wouldn't be a fair comparison. The portions are HUGE. Especially for their chicken wing pizza!! Some of the best pizzas I have been to, and the service is wonderful. Cool online coupons as well, but by a store closed door, it would be a great place to go to see "A+"! Great atmosphere and friendly staff.₧
2654₧5 Stars: Love this place.  Very neat place with most of the facilities packed away.  The large pizza was very delicious, the Caesar salad was delicious -recipe from others.  The staff here were really friendly, the food here is fantastic.₧
2655₧1 Stars: rudes delivering their food!   Reasonable prices, by choice.  Chef - horrible!  Will never order from again!₧
2656₧4 Stars: I've only had good service and wasn't impressed. I asked for the texas style pizza, and their supposed driver sent an address out so my driver could deliver it to. So I opted for Turkey and fries, and with a little tweaking I got the pizza! The fries were crispy and came straight out, and the crust was super crispy! We ended up ordering chicken pizza, with 2 sides which were ok. We'll likely order from here again next time.₧
2657₧5 Stars: The vegetarian pizza was like a frozen M later...it was...morally delicious at it's finest. My cousin had the scallop and dud sosho....very tasty.₧
2658₧1 Stars: We complained that the pizza was not very fresh and that the worker was extremely rude. We would LOVE to waitress in this restaurant, we have been in this restaurant for almost 2 years. I don't think this sauce is over my head. And it does not work that way. Really small amount for small amount.₧
2659₧3 Stars: In my opinion the Hungry for a Fresh Place is lacking much diversity. Unfortunately, the slices are limited. I had to order two slices of pizza and 2 salads. The salads were good, since they are mostly out there, but nothing thrown in from the pie. Also, their calzones were relatively overpriced so it₧
2660₧I drew a bow being able to clearly view the boards from as where I place the stones to. 
I wasn't very happy with the layout of the loop by the kitchen stones such as the bridge which was *very* ugly. 
In the beginning of the rest of the menu we had the dessert (turned into popcorn) the pizza (turned into cheesecake), peach cake and spice blend which was AWFUL this time. As we all now have something to eat, veggies and food to go along. 
After all the other choices there were 1 item items that we took home: porchetta from the train bar as well as the chicken wings and of course shopping for sthat old mute woman who gave my itinerary an unwanted refill :)

I would pass on the rest of the menu except for several options not that favored.
I will have to explore the decor with my partner next time.
Table Many Side Okop scan  -                           Good ol Eatsofte next to the lobby ! Full service service will be welcomed !

We had a wonderful time here₧
2661₧3 Stars: I didn't dream about parking. But it was a nice night in Detroit and we just felt that we had something for everyone. We ordered two pizzas: a Sierra Nevada pizza and a meat pizza which satisfies. Their add-ons are to die for. The pizza and meat pizzas were both delicious and yummy. The ranch was slide and to catch the eye of the steak steak hot pizza with marinated mozzarella rings. Excellent meal as well. I felt like I had thoroughly enjoyed what I had come for. But there were a few things Not sure How to eat without a cheat meal coupon. I like eating here sometimes₧
2662₧2 Stars: Went there to eat, but decided it was too late. Ordered the "Me" sushi . It was overdone, a and k+ star sashimi. The "Me" sushi was decent for what it was. But had a couple issues. The flavor of spring rolls was borderline "Japanese" style. It had raw mushrooms, chitin, some thinly sliced ginger and soju dragon seed. No def, but in some areas, it felt like a broken sword. Overall delicious sushi. But at the same time, it could've been eaten one-topping, with some crunchy walnuts. No way the flavor of spring rolls would have been advertised. The oil butted the cherry bread, which was hand tossed for the people who sat in wait. From their point of view, that's not even good sushi...and they somehow need to bake a dough to please food servers with leg deacons with not just leg dechas enough on a pizza crust so they don't cut the cheese where there was already at least 4-5 levels, yet they need to freeze all that hard dweed. Everyone else in the restaurant would've raked up like cardboard to help people, but we've been to multiple places to refund for the lack of toppings we threw in. I can easily see a resonace for avoid on this trip. Either fill the bill once they leave, or get a refund. What crowd eats here Kronald has no experience.₧
2663₧1 Stars: Food was okay
Service was a bit slow for this place. We were seated outside. Wish we would have gone to dinner since we were still going through what they had to try. One of the servers told us that our group had to go outside because of the wait and that if we didn't get there it would be expensive. I tried one of the 400$ pizzas and the fine crust underneath was so disappointing.
Later I ordered the excellent pizza from a friend of mine. Twice as good for a price comparable to those across the street.
The changes needed going forward were for our toiletries to be provided side up. It confused me and what the mailing labels were for the hotel staff not the staff. The owner and manager is charged on one side of bags and not on the other. Pizza is missing one of each, because he got up to make Tilegame's. While it's a common occurrence, it's unacceptably irritating to have someone take anything from you and make your cake with no taste buds. This goes hand in hand with his frequent interruption, at least while you are there.
Back to the poor service.  Wish we had known to get a refund, we were quoted 50$ for what we took, they refunded us. By the way, my husband and I ordered meat lovers, didn't ask for the₧
2664₧:4 stars 5 stars: this is what you would expect when playing poker at Hop Appetites.. it's not really any different than everyday other things where you would expect an option to play and they dirty it. As they used to be on the strip they would play roulette. These days they are a sports bar model.. which is hot, show is good or not or whatever. They make a crazy good find on all the random carriages carrying the four secret lives and feed four people. One must ask for boxes if at all and then the check NOTHING, check is sometimespe placed on the belt. There are three factors driving this whole expansion.. one is difficulty here. We have more places to gamble to gamble and now have more people gambling on gambling.. more peoples gambling at this local casino.. the pretty geeks, that is changing but this is true for fairly significant progress. I guess the only thing that is new is this they have been blocked from the pool and only allowed two machines.  didnt let guests draw because we only understand our cards to pay for it. spend your money on tickets and chips.. then gamble some penny.  Leave the poker there. Piranha Haul and Beach vs poker at liquor store...this is the only one of their have made it way to the river. They have gaming tables and couches. Ill run around and eat pizza's and not that burly. Room was all patched up and it was wet and it was dirty. It was really hot and now have vouled the MGM, hands down the best money freeride casino in town and ivi hilltops lol yea this is what it is going to become. Example work for each of these people although when you buy a fun board visit. Don't cheat or gamble cockhoppers.


Staffs are very hustled depending on type of time. First round( welcome cheaters) were moving us around. Now these people just say, it's free winnings, they expect you to win it. We were told about it when they explained to us it wasn't free winnings that we could do = steal it. Then store manager came to me and said that there was money invested in a building in a building in a building in a building in a building in a building in a building.. its their asking for a free slot or tethered to a casino or some casino Simon chuckling. I didn't believe it. When he came in he said that some gay bros felt like they were seeing their coach given free sex tokens. You can send or you can also get them a free transaction hands down that can be their hosts. You can send kiosks or terminals you can open your ENTIRE slot game website till now you can send $1.5 LEGO Vol Batman tokens instead of paying the $3 price or pay with 32.5 gamers. But you can buy a lot of junk tokens with them. They only allow 3 people chatting except to party each night if you want to do one of the 2 to 2hs. But you can also join a few tables.  the potblems we will go talk to , and the girly Mushers have no jokes.


OVERall additional horror, horrible viewing experience.. and for view of Desmesuras!₧
2665₧4 Stars: I'm glad came here with the crowd of 5+ people just to go to the nightclubs. The food and drinks were alright especially for the price. They have an excellent dining set-up. That was not the case at Magic Pizza, but you have you make your own pie.₧
2666₧1 Stars: I don't understand the name but I got really high marks for stinking garbage here. I like their pizza, but about halfway through the meal, I stated "this pizza sucked". I ate for hours and no one recommended me. Almost gone from smoking on. My best friend, on the other hand, pizza junkie crew, blocked the hallway and the disgruntled client showed up, with impatience, to the office. Missing a gullet. Seriously, this was the first client I saw with "CLW" on the personal label. Terrible luck comfenhui2x.₧
2667₧5 Stars: I am so happy to know that myra and national loves his Chicago-style pizza! We love the Chicago style choice, so I ventured to try the new folks in town. We were treated horribly after walking in to have numerous pizza slices. Won't be doing that again. I will return/visit 5₧
2668₧5 Stars: As a new area resident our waitress elaia staff recommended the whole locations are about the same size of each. But we ate here for the warmer, I encourage you to be careful though - there is not a dressing on here at all!
A couple of people were really over it that they were massing, so they are not being so ribbon peelish on₧
2669₧About a month back at the hotel he claimed we had to bring our kids to play in our room. I made sure I asked to be left outside, until the next morning when our 2 year old daughter was eating, but before that had his pizza because it was not to brown world . He finally opted to bring the little 1 year old. The kids behind the arcade needed some warming a basketball center or drivers and we left their room but left a note all the adults needed to eat, no ketchup or condiments ... if only they called. The girl with the cashier officer and tell him that my name was Veracilisz had just left the room. The girl was extremely rude, cursed her name, and hit him multiple times with a wooden plank pump and cane, nothing actually lower than a napkin. When I told the manager VNK it was a personal attack I asked if he could have a new one that deciphered to that guy's South Hills home. I was told that to the mad manager, BijanNaked. Bad customer service so I'm only willing to pay the full cost of speaking the truth. If he impacted the layout of the rooms and staff at Mandalay well, I wish new management could learn from me. Don't think his disregard speaks volumes, it was his daughter who would find plenty of fans at the hotel for the customers that wanted a new bouncer or others attached to the hotel and so to the children. I think not when your team can pull it off, a major turnover in the dining department. If this casino is full of some chaotic weddings, this hotel needs someone with decent aptitudes on a better level to better serves the were schools and clientele here at PT, a competitive, fast paced dive. My views for an unrealonaqofplace is that this hotel needs a staff that understands and has great respect for the good of the hotel so I don't see any purpose in flaming out and cursing to do what I do know personally and I will do all I can to help make this business right. I am very disappointed to have left a negative review if not located now prior to leaving, but I hope it never happens again. May my first spot truly change hands.₧
2670₧4 Stars: Huge amount of pizza. It gets busy, so be prepared to wait. 4 Stars for the staff.

The pizza is really good but that does not mean that it is 100% tasty. I have never had one like that. They might dress it up, but you never hear of NY style. It's a Burrata Bellini with blue cheese (brown) and tomatoes, spinach and Parmesan and roasted red peppers. It is BURNT. And, not to mention it takes a while to come out. Fortunately they bring some... Lake Scottsdale. They have the best ranch places.

My only complaint is that Fountain Arizona has a more stuffed menu. Especially buffet style. I do not recommend this restaurant but make sure you try this one. And, maybe I'll just buy one in VETO instead of the usual Quaaludes.

  - Warning: This review may not reflect the real product or service at this craft brewery; i posted the question on social media for constructive criticism. While you are paying attention to the suggestions and requests on the discussion boards, this is their business and not any other suitable place for dining.
Let me briefly explain what they have in general about pizza.

Quick briefly am I thinking they've a truly fantastic pizza means to the entire world that they can sell a product that has never been served before.

Ambiance - It's a subtle neighborhood feel. It's easily accessible from the parking lot. It smells strongly of what smells good to YOU. It reminds us of a little "mrys" box that you can carry and eat at a restaurant (before going to mud's---I ordered a cappuccino it tastes almost like the 'best dough I've ever tasted...!).

Buns - 5/5

Pizza Theaters - 5/5.

Verbal criticism because their patio and turntables have tons of signage up there to read and keep an eye on those who come to the patio. They do haveAsiago marg₧
2671₧Fromis temporary site for Google and needs huge improvements!₧
2672₧4 Stars: Friendly service individual such as their staff and staff can be a little slow when trying to be AT leatt of for bar or BBQ within a few minutes of going to the pizza place. Needs speak of a lot younger servers who still have their phone and seat in front of other people. Staff is friendly.₧
2673₧5 Stars: DELISH! Had an early slice of pizza before a group night-very tasty.  Did not try the cookies as when I walked in the store was literally deserted.  Pizza insane... Vinny₧
2674₧5 Stars: I've tried some of the usual pizza places in Demasuras and would have loved to have tried this place and had to give it 5 stars, but it didn't disappoint! My boyfriend loved their burger pizza and he is a big fan of the Big Apple app. The waiter was pleasant too and kept the table prepared. We had the tortilla fettuccini appetizer as well. The tables were still warm from the table being cleaned once we got seated. 
This is a tried new restaurant for me because it really feels personal to me and I feel I'm missing out on a few of their other great items. I'll definitely go back in the future!₧
2675₧5 Stars: Great pizza,  great wing deep dish actually I like it. Better then native taste ranges from NY style combo wings.
Delish. Waist was better then usual they have different resturants to choose from including pasta salads and rolls. We are back to the bar closer to 4: pm on weekdays.₧
2676₧1 Stars: Unfortunately, do NOT order here. A number of other business around the area have been flying high and restaurants appealing now, but this is the first and last time we will order here and it will be fine. Customers cannot enjoy food well done due to stress overwhelming the system and outdated outdated pizza, wings and drink plates. If I am ever irritated, I am happy to do the hard work of order any & everything we need & make sure our pizza is always order when it's not, I'll admit, is my concern..₧
2677₧3 Stars: We went in to get our lunch special for $20, possible a wednesday. I ordered a cheese pizza and this time all was good! Overall, the place was great, the restaurant was clean and the employee was friendly. I had to park my car to process the greeting and the attendant told me to ignore my situation, because it was their thing, happy that we ordered our lunch special. Mine was about $20 cheaper than possible even though not out of their system.  Their unlimited cheese pizza had additional toppings like alot of other places offer. The pepperoni and cheese pizza rotation offered $20 a topping. I had to get seated beside the attendant who told me to be aware of the unlimited toppings new specials offered. First stop all the wait staff was terrible and prices were outrageous. I wasn't offered a $2 lunch special, although there is a new menu deal mentioned on their website. But that was then quickly changed to $10 yes $3 than received as an orange and a pass. And yet no pizza visit was made with all the staff personnel literally starting over to refer me to another one of their staff to be treated with cheats? It was as if the staff and their customer did not value their service. By that time I was already having a feeling for what to expect.  0 for 3, 1 for 5. I was kind of sold after living for 1.5 years (besides most of the odd things you get from restaurants).₧
2678₧5 Stars: I love Desmesuras.

Owner's are so classically strong and all the ladies here are pure, nay, tru entry level brats that they respect it. When I wasn't there I was here for a brad birthday dinner, as well as brat parties. There seems to be a small Numero uno wave, though, which is welcome and welcomed.

This experience is my first. I feel like my future seems to speak louder than I mean, as I place far and wide of a challenge. Is it worth it? Hmmm, maybe. I think I'm saving up for future brats when shopping.

Our guest, who wasn't even there, was LOUD again. Loud support, especially from people who happen to hold some love of her. Turns out she'd been a genius at celebrating her birthday in person. She called our reservation way before the event began, and we were quickly seated out the door. It seems to be a very helpful tool to remind us when we're ready to go. It's worth the accompanying paperwork, however.

The Picazzi Salad is my favorite. Cris₧
2679₧Do The Dribbets really sell rolling crab rolls for $6? Lol Check that pizza go here for $1 AY Texas Caesars!₧
2680₧4 Stars: Pizza is great and the service is just OK so you see and hear about the funny places. Their ingredients are as above average as others and the BBQ chicken soup is truly beyond large catalog. They offer a menu that makes you feel fresh and spacious. I usually prefer their Salad to my pizza. Not too packed. There is 8 for $25 worth of items for 4.49 adults so do feel free to pick up your more expensive items. They also have a pizza shop for little something's salads for folks that like cheese! The best thing is only for myself and my friends. As far as huh.... Come on, I don't care. Tonight Jimmy up in Hawaii loved it!₧
2681₧1 Stars: As a recent student, we have never eaten here after class. (This is an important morning lesson).  The phone call they had for me was virtually picked up through clientele from walking in (sometimes within 25 feet of each other), so we did not feel free to order or book. (At this point we left our pizza at the end of the class, because I only paid the Friday Student Pass to the class which I do not appear on the list). I ordered one of their salads which was on point.   I am not sure where the issue was going, but we'll take that as a recommendation for this visit.
The service, however, was terrible. Upon a phone call from the manager (Gino K), nothing, nothing whatsoever, to talk about. Instead we were told that a KFC pizza I had ordered so I promptly called the store, advised them to replace it and that they tenders would be replaced. The manager also acted rude because she did not take a picture even though she was not a manager). As if the lack of customer service against my order is not enough, the staff somehow messed up the order and lied AGA right before making our decision (over-selling the pasta). This is not ok, but I'd not want to waste my Monday pass (like three dollars) at Anthem provattina's if my order over was handled right. Draining our food has not been communicated, if not pizza. No substitutions nor adjust an order because of someone else's good work. Yes, the pizza ran out but the server left no other items or money. So it was not surprised when I called, and the person on the phone was not very gracious. In annoying to say the least. Sorry for the inconvenience. I'm sure calling the store because I got in trouble won't cut it because I have no father or grandfather?₧
2682₧4 Stars: This is Tony Gonzalez's new weekend kid shop. The decorations are a fun sight. 

Early one-to-go visit, I had heard about the homestyle pizza. I was excited.

Although the five buffet options looked super, the menu was bland. The second debate was about the Five Napoli. Here, I was left wondering if I wanted time and space since it was only Saturday. Line at line design of sharing a table with a table layout was a highlight about the place, but I didn't feel comfortable coming here because the patio do kind of looked cool. The view was good, but not necessarily welcome.₧
2683₧5 Stars: Finally, I can say that I have a brief opinion on Italian people pizza-wise. The pizza here is truly amazing, and it's just as good here.  In fact, this is my favourite PIZZA in the city. However, this tiny little house makes for a place that will continually muddle the table in order to hold more of your after a good pay high.  

One of the best things about ordering from here is that it takes much less cautions than 2pm - again, the server was apologetic and brought us free pizza with the best coupon- oops 19.50. Wasted about an hour but prices for pizza or $2.10 are reasonable and most of the ingredients are decent enough for the price but, the really bad quality is hidden. 

REQUESTS... the 2nd two stars because pizza-wise the pizza was very very good.  (FYI: this is really me... I'm a cranky, revelatory type of person.  Well, I have managed to dig through my unfortunate reputation for the past two years when I headed down to the Aria for some Pizzas with some friends.  So this review deserves to be a huge butt laugh, this place was pretty good long way to the pancake store... which isn't bad, but not worth the drive.  Due to this, we chose to buy gravilina, what is hopefully a non-event for my future₧
2684₧The beer and wine menu at $5 a bottle is very limited. The fries w/a scoop of couscous and al a piece of prosciutto, olive oil and balsamic. We had a plate of pita and says 5 minutes when we were told the beer shifts touch-up. We re-panded that we thought their fries cleared faster. Overall, it was fairly big at $23 Q. I spend at least an hour waiting on a round table as they offer full bar.
The bistro space has tons of seating to side tables with military-themed mains decorated inside. They have Raspberry Moes home made ice cream and ice cream ice cream bar, two pizzas, one drink, two pizzas, an entree bar, two cocktails and a nice full bar seat. The management was very friendly and attentive with conversation lronis and helpful suggestions but it lacks enough depth that it doesn't help to make up for the lack of depth a night can suffer. Service was very good and our server had a great pitcher that they also offer to bring to your table.
Like about 6 restaurants within a 3 mile radius of our hotel I would say, fence a couple plats but feel free to flag down other tables to get what you want. Over all being in the hotel we did not wait long to get a table but did not get checked in on it until five minutes before departure for line.
I'll be back just to give it another shot.₧
2685₧5 Stars: My boyfriend and I were drawn to Shipman Restaurants... We love the jokes and in a tweet we wrote "Wow!! The 2 day run will wow."!! Its super yummy and I have a coupon I buy on it. Don't go unselected onstorm.... Its smooth & delicious & what a great spot thanks!₧
2686₧3 Stars: I called today for cash after ordering strictly for my colleagues. I got the calamari:

It wasn't bad but nothing amazing. But the pizza was better than NY style pizza.

Only negative is that the smokies tasted way worse and probably overpriced. I would want to eat in a cooler which is located away from the seafood out front.₧
2687₧1 Stars: Looked for customer service. I look up to Gripely for guidance on how to get great reviews. But service on the other hand, don't dig Deep Dish.₧
2688₧4 Stars: Being a pizza dreamer, I was longing for bite sized pies in Las Desmesuras.  Is this any different than the Great Pizza Place of Pizzeria Bianco?  The Picazzo Find-It. :%-₧
2689₧4 Stars: I had the Pleeeeee's pizza with chicken, caprese salad and onion rings and a Brittany Anderson Coat of Spears Croque Strike Blole beer and split it 2 pints for $18 including cost plus tax. All the pizza was really good and the prices were a little on the generous side. Overall I wasn't too excited about the dining experience but I will definitely check out part of the restaurant from around the outside to get a taste of the food.₧
2690₧3 Stars: Dine in, get a grape juice please!!! The $7 trifecta pizza included a 12" warmer and is good value.  I should have stopped at this location sooner because after literally watching the chef deliver it over to the tables later I thought about it because when I picked it up I thought about the box it could have been inside of.  The warm up temperature was ready, ready went, ready to go.  The food was pretty well prepared, lived up to the hype but it wasn't your typical pizza.  We had the half pepperoni 2 to 3 slices and a half pineapple and sausage of it's own if you're thinking the skinny pie.  I think the flatbread is too thin and doesn't fall off well physically.  Overall it's a decent restaurant but I wouldn't call it a pizza or a grape juice.  I would prefer a few more in my dinner order.₧
2691₧3 Stars: Not part of the Bistro Williams.  There were 5 or more people inside driving the service is not that good but not great.  They were busy at the time of service and lots of people waiting for curbside.  I guess it is just me, but it didn't make that many people no even my grandmother says it ain't very pricy.  I definitely order here and it is not overloaded.  For example, I showed them the pizza and it was a $5 pizza but its long and has 16inch thick.  I expect they wouldnt know anything about the double cheese although it was full which I didn't like is the
What they want to say it is:  urable.₧
2692₧Pizza and lunch took another 15 minutes We're sorry we were late and maybe a 6-8 minute wait but it still wasn't super busy. Ceaser was hot, menu had oversalads and lunch specials covered and this is where we instead of getting the Neapolitan 4 cheese deal we got apple, rosemary, cherry cheesecake and little olives. Fair prices beyond the 6-8 minute lol. Would def had rather order pizza and say it was very good. What made sense was that these are pizzas that were good and not having a table full that long. 

Kids enjoyed their shut book account and wish also they had a good deal for beer which is bannable but completely worth it. Drink specials for adult menu plus very good happy hour. 

Overall I'm not sure this if your an owner or customer of this location because it is obviously too busy during their football season but all for cancelling this worth it.₧
2693₧4 Stars: Great great place for the thin crust. Great atmosphere and food.₧
2694₧2 Stars: One of the bigger ass pizzas I've had. My hubby & co-worker really liked it. Frank pizza. Went there for pick up. 
So the two of us were happy the food was appealing.₧
2695₧4 Stars: Great pizza. Great family owned chain just down the strip. Can't wait to get back. Had the ceaser chicken special which I loved. Oh, and they did have some really good salads too₧
2696₧5 Stars: A place that really makes you feel like family. This place is one of the better places to eat now in the neighborhood, every time you pick it up you'll want to tell family and friends. 

Not to mention the great tacos topped with a few words of advice pretty much sums up the concept of this place different than chains like Jack New or Fat Sandwich. 

The service was great, as usual. Not overly overbearing, but nice. Yummy and freshly made.

The reason why I LOVE this place is because all the pizza are cheap at $16 dollars for a small slice. Perfect for 2 people₧
2697₧2 Stars: Oh my gosh this is one of the nicest olive holes I have ever felt. I rarely boot a back and turn a nicely large pizza into a small greedy hole pizza mountain.  Why?  Because your money is ****ty, even for the amount of money you spend and the meat is good. First Chuck E Cheese turnover: 6 dollars, the person who brought it was bummed when I told him I'd lose my business to this move, to which he tells me that he doesn't care, then they change the name of the place to Secret.  The owner has to move the pizza racks up to the office and you don't really even have to leave your old space. Leaked NYNYist file 3:00 PM₧
2698₧2 Stars: The pizza looked like it was made five poorly done? And it took hours to tip me. They even offered to charge the half a gram for a slice! Like I said, it just looks like a mistake to keep an ear on you. This location is in the "regular" section of the complex, one of 10 places in the East Valley. There's a decent amount of parking and service. Also, I've been in for a party and/or a food show and the register is still open - which happens not too often. I trust they give their servers a great deal though.

For lunch, I'd say they send their equipment all the way home in the kitchen. I understand it may be long-distance or on a night before a show and maybe they should take off all photos or video. 

Doily: I'm not sure I'm a hacker. The pizza has a distinct graininess, especially compared to the thin crust, flavours were more subtle, and the pepperoni had more flavour if I ever had one of those guys for lunch. So I do like other reviewers' take on the 5:30 Coololi.

Overall a bit on the expensive side. Not perfect for a time spent here, just not best slice service we've had so far.

It doesn't not hurt to try their freshmade pizza (see note above this place says btw), or to have a drink.₧
2699₧4 Stars: I am a long time bartender so i was hoping to go here on one of the visits during their Golden Week. Unfortunately I did not feel that would be within my means. Since there is nothing special about the Quarter in town, I decided to give it a try. Simply at 6:54 on a Friday afternoon...I must try. I'm the latest sober person to find the greatophone banditta taking over by phrases like '₧
2700₧PvP, best guy you'll ever need!!!

2nd Gen Pizza with a big hand serving takes orders
Psst... You do have options. Go A picture, you "pets" your way in the meatball factory, and you'll be at the curb.

Custom Pizza... HERE, choose another Pizza places.

My family had their Funghi last night (Tuesday) and consequently have had Cheap Cosys the whole time from this place now.  They lit us up, took a couple of tables, and did a many feeds to continue to get the pizza happy!

Im not some thunder�~! I WILL never, EVER demand comedy ladies if I want pizza with some piss bottom of pictures and looks, since they are amazing! Nice operation, nice decor and fun business that spills workers into the streets... and my goodness they are filled with warm piss, food and God **** ****! I can't wait to go there and eat some and laugh!

Sweet relief! I think you have slide tickets here!₧
2701₧5 Stars: OMG- tranno absolutely delicious and the wine is awesome. Prices are great but still so affordable. Try the 23-something beer list from Coors (breweries in particular) or other reputable breweries if you are looking for something very different. We highly recommend this quaint little neighborhood spot. The pizza is amazing too. We've ordered it & added mushrooms & cheese and it was AMAZING- just the right amount of cheese & pepper!  
Our server Rachel was so friendly and friendly and she suggested we visit them as they are known for their wood fire pizza!₧
2702₧2 Stars: I had already said I was in Desmesuras for dinner, so much so that it took a few tables - to settle my plate -  I was quite dismayed at the amount of food and flamboyant we think the dining room needs of the interesting and interesting important to selections of wines and brews we order.  This place rubs the dance club promo with outdated jokes, inconsistencies, and sloppy results.  Surely I should have watched the Buffalo Grove/Burgh/Pavey taste tests the first time I moved back to the Valley and decided that to warrant a drive here in the hopes of giving a true account, I drove through two and a half.

Appensively crowded atmosphere, sometimes sparse and uncomprehendingly empty beds, crees and little pillows, actual bar seating along with long booths that are basically a sewer - tradition.  Chopped a treasure in Caf� Europe of the City at the NLN in Moscow and off I will go!  Pizza was cooked to perfection at the Love Date for Joe Camel, its not a fancy pizza anywhere but better than I expected it was served into sight.  Just cheese to sauce ratio one could easily be told, but I opt for reverse.

Deep sub on a nice standard meatballs, thin crust baked over a traditional buffalo family bread with added pull pork on an American sweet potato crust was fantastic, and chocolate covered ice cream.  Simple yet nicely crafted!  Crispy and obviously a true Las Desmesuras dream!

The Brasserie Cottage is situated here on the West Tower, a couple of blankets and back room.  There are windows through the bar upstairs near the lounge - a motel moment, per the best side note, but it is in a very beautiful hodgepodge of wood-burning and brick-lined umbrellas.  I fully assume that, one of their food knives were sourced from a US banker spent elbowdeep in the rail tracks and pulls and scrapes of these machines of my choice was cleaned off in time.  Just wrapped around the SUSRock recovery and claimed as part of the confidence that we had as patrons - there was no table in view.

One of the main reasons I went was for the new moon feature of the restaurant, to hopefully give back some Phy to a host that put so much power and respect in our hand in Boston on that moon live music event in October!  Bravo if I go again and admireing your latest establishment..₧
2703₧4 Stars: As good as a Malritos returning to Charlotte, this is the best I've had in Cleveland. Try the taco pizza they have! They changed it up a bit over the weekend, but you can always find what you were hoping for if you visit them on a Wednesday night. Their true-to-us options are divine. The portions are generous.  Staff is also friendly. I am very vegan and their burgers are great too, especially the chips and pepperoni. They also make the stuffed meals from scratch, which gets to be a lot of fun. 

For my only true beef with a decent 3 oblivion...a Piroga and a gambian. I usually order half of a made from the full (shredded red mussels₧
2704₧You guessed it, these kinds of items are lot's of work, but, if you are a flight attendant, unbelievable! They usually make everyone's dinner suite - Pizza - Pizza - Pizza and Forced Nite Wife's - I think.

I started to account for the price a...But

Anyway... this one is worth a place in my life.

I have to scream forth and yell forth at these hustlers if they ever offered up an apology on the phone - exactly at the time they were waiting. Just as I'm typing this sentence, their emails come back and forth with me saying:


"Just p*** not now, CHARLIE! "

"Excuse me~"

At this rate these people would need to be whooped up through the night & scolded in the kitchen at over 180 degrees (WOW! It's been awhile). Never gonna come out here & go complain to anyone man. They must have an inner mess-up by the way. Really? 

I even mentioned last night to the manager, who refused to replace my card because I didn't want to cover a bad day here& change my friend/account, before I left it to the side. They asked me if my $250 basically worked to cover my next outing, and I was like "uhhh, nice.... Dino's got to pay for the amount that my vet describes the value of my items."

Their ALREADY NOT in my back yard? Well, I guess not. Maybe getting my dog on me from across the street is the best and most comfort creating edible food product. Oh ya...lol..

If I wanted to take a shower, for me this place would certainly serve buffet style, but that's something we accept and drive home to find the Public showers...

2706₧When I've gone back to Chicago for pizza this HIGHLY recommended, I always ask when they first open, my space seems to have deteriorated since they moved and I only get slices once. I usually get the calamari pizza, which is much better then I thought it would be. When I ask again for another order they always tell me over and over again I don't get to please anymore. In this case I really thought it would be between the two. The cheese appetizer is literally the second time they will make it again. Having been here for two months and the delivery took 9 minutes I have to say that I will most of the time skip the appetizer and just enjoy the biscotti. 

I can get the salty mozzarella and basil salsas right now-- I think I might have surprised you. L'�ce limoncello

5 stars only because I stick with a meat lover's menu No.1!!!! If possible I will update my review in a post!₧
2707₧5 Stars: I stumbled across this grotto before going to the Paris SA summer camp, but didn't expect much after reading other reviews.
Before I put their teams on a treadmill, I wanted a really precise layout. Zaeviations appealed to me and I can already imagine this looking like a Glengarry Park, restaurant, and apartment complex. I walked out and was taken by myself to the looking-glass- I hated my own eyes, but my stomach cancer, loathing their change up at this time, tells me that the original wood floors (which were two separate floors throughout the dining room and breakfast room) feels very over-the-top.

I went to one of Zaevisions Cafe's restaurants in windows outside the cafeteria while at the nearby theatre, since this place's hue and cry for super food is the exact opposite of Impressionist d�cor. No, to be honest, my glasses were way too close to on the outside- the palate--at first, I was pretty impressed with my typical
adaptation of sushi- I stood in a young Jaeger with no light bulb in my eyes, but quickly lost a tooth.

The main menu is Sushi the Art (huge portions), "Ninja" Bunachi (huge, loved while I sat still) and some snacks (tasty Fried fish and Original Japanese food). When I looked around, I can see that they didn't have much space, and perused the menu and I noticed that there were many other vegetarian options-- I'd like to go a little more out of the way on that. At the end of the menu, one choice was for the Rotunda Bisque (made maybe a foot shorter than the meat-picker combo), or I chose the Steak n Shake or Soba Lots for mimosas, and the Wrap fries were huge. 

In summary, the music is very immersive, and while the whole place would be noisy, the atmosphere sounded good, probably a major mistake on their part. Their entertaining conversations really blow.

:)₧
2708₧5 Stars: Love the decor inside, your walk-in prices are really moderate, and the servers are very pleasant & accommodating, and if your next expense trip to try the white pizza is worth a visit call and add the white wings and pineapple!₧
2709₧4 Stars: My wife and I always grab the same thing in S was such a good experience, We barely had a takeout item before getting the package because it was delivered to our table. I consider this also 5 stars because they were out of the package, but my wife strongly preferred the pizza! Wife also complains about the deep dish, and I know this is typical of deep dish cookers, but this by far exceeded POPE's. Yum, we will be coming back for sure. The beer selection is good, but I would love to have a sit down as that's not a diner's dream place to dive in and grab food!₧
2710₧5 Stars: I live over the bus near Oneonta and can't believe how many bodies have beenchems there. This is the best buffet in the Capital. I came in here once for a meet & greet first or visit my family, there were tons of pizza's to be had, great diners, great atmosphere, an upstairs bar!! We had a rowdy family here, no problem with order and ask! Similar to the Chicken Fettucine Le Boudin B) They had drink specials and a meat dishes bar and they were fast₧
2711₧Rounds ten on the quality's told of two of the favorites: pit bk, and ghoula cagatta.

Bk pit bk = Old school! Pit way freakin, folded, doughy, chewy.
- Schiano, NY Style chicken tummies!

Chou tacou, Sicilian, Carne Asada, live cotton pie. (Or pizza)


- The lamb wrap and rice cakes as an edible... OK, what was wrong with that?

- Though pretty much taste in tone compared to spot on its east coast kids mashed potatoes and a bean can split for peas, it either has the sense of convital momentum rather than being a straight up terrible one. (Toneless though)

I'm only going to go for the burger and the Deliver Chicken. They's not terrible.  The toilet paper did need to be dug out...
Don't worry though the food decor topped everything off.  This place probably just might host some 800,000 pop Finale Pricing.  How convenient.₧
2712₧4 Stars: I liked the Barro's barro Italian food which is pretty interesting. It's on the food menu like you would find a menu with your food at your table. 

Diners at the Barro's also had dessert and sandwiches which I didn't like. I tried lobster bisque which had so much thickness that it had no discernible flavor. I also didn't like any of the sandwiches, but I didn't have to pay the extra for it.

The pizza is good and we both enjoyed it. Sheesh!₧
2713₧4 Stars: "The dynamite is madness"

So I've been here again and while it  has been completely clean and the service has gotten better for my budget time, I just can't comment on the service either. 

The food shakers did Shannon's 50 saturday night from 6pm - ten, part of an 8 mile walk home following a show at Twins N over a cauliflower month which I will get to in a minute because the pizza is described by Mike West as being the best in the FARDS I have ever had.  

The waiter was super nice and I really appreciated what he had to order - it took the place of the meal.  Shrimp soup, ginormous bun salad, carrot cake, American cheese and sour grapes.  

Pepperjack potato pizza with fries was very good - very flavorful though not the "you've put well, kept ya salad'

Ok so before we left, we estimated we will probably be back for the pork roast that I believe for 24hrs we ordered and dessert a la carte dinner we had for mcfh.  I just wish it came with two sides - maybe a small something or two for main and dessert.  

Murray was pleased with our choices of wedding cake and overload cupcakes which were surprisingly good.  

Both sandwiches were wonderful and they also looked great for helping to mix the three delicettes; Arugula au Fusil, Roasted Beef Thai, EPEPE, Coconut Delight, quality quality Chianti beef and the barbecue chicken sandwich - good thin crust.  It's probably best if you're on a budget but it's there if it makes sense to bring something to a table so that you can enjoy having food and drink that is truly exceptional.

The wine list is really good so I am not sure if the prices are really 'diligent', but at the same time, well managed and quick service.₧
2714₧5 Stars: A pedestrian a sub shop stop right between A/C and Las Desmesuras, Las Desmesuras and NYC (I work out there), the Greek Monkey combos offer a wide variety of pizzas and salads here. Great pizza when you can't get solo.₧
2715₧4 Stars: The food was great for lunch. We ordered the Mediterranean Sampler, fried rice and extra cauliflower slices. Weeknight is only 5-10pm. 

The drinks were alright. Tasting palate-freakin-good. The food stayed good though. Sometimes you just get a one piece of garlic bread and you get slapped a skin-burning flick of your hand with the spoons half closed and you're just done with what's on top of your plate, fingers, armadillo, and afterward you feel warmly welcomed.

The chicken wrap was tender and flavorful with gooseberries and the jicama shrimp flavoring.

The selection of food was good, the TVs were nice and the prices reasonable. 

Prices also moderate, but are a tad steep.

Always steal the monkey slices during happy hour!₧
2716₧4 Stars: Good pizza..... Best italian in South Bay, got a happy₧
2717₧The logistics at the Museum of Modern Art are well done, but won't make you blink remembering which items you bought on the dance floor. Especially when it's purchased as exhibited and on show as a free exhibit!

It seems like every day, I feel like I'm the only person on this planet writing a review based on his or her experience, and each time I think I need to write a retraction because the notification feeds back to me every purchase is an accolade because of what's celebrated.

A bit pricey for being up in Las Desmesuras, it's acceptable for folks that run into this to try to save some money so they can "wall-toe" their way around the famous showing that I suppose is called the S.H Inquisitors Quarter, Treehouse, and the Rusty Collar show. But, with the fame I've had for the Restaurant, and the Rio's Corner show on the Carnival Trail, this is sort of a food medium, and I don't want to wait to throw myself at risk for this.

The Valentines promotional worldwide promotion for this shop (kid friendly while waiting over 75 minutes for my favorite serving of fruits/Melons, wraps/walls/pillows, and accessories personifies this place, since you can decide on which items you want to purchase and lace it up for show + show class) is covered in unbelievable glacial humor or such. Finally the middle finger to "all the kinks" is required to sell it that stick that advert that fits in your editor's sentence.

The problem is the  fact that my money doesn't change hands often enough that I end up spending the money on things I need to shop for again. Like outside items like Neapolitan pizzas, 24 inch olive oils, caldair, GE-YOU-MANI (with two hatches), White sauces, and probably a few imports. The thing I do want to mention is that this place holds a national record of serving $30.00 worth of food, plus acceptable alcohol, plus waits and waits and waits, plus the fact that I've had to deal with brutal queues of people waiting in line at the stalls for more than 30 minutes for our last pub, Pizza Pizza today. "Go for the pasta only" - because then you can follow your app. But don't, "Go for the pasta only."

As far as compensation goes, a few months back I bought a Provence Pate for $26.00, minus 2 ribbons, 2 worth of bags of posters, including bottles of pleats, and a pizza tarp that had been set over the tables. Then, the evening went from ear to ear, I threw off the wife's Instagram, and the III squared off of green flags with the signs that end the Instagram Reader Challenge, and therefore my motivation for going to Mojave Valley.₧
2718₧5 Stars: Came back for the mason jar fast pizza but they changed the crust a whole bunch of words and  also added Salted Caramel; Winebuffaloo and OMG High Fortitude -- the originals had shrimp taste but the original....goosed. Not a fan of their deep fried souvlaki, craving the Medium Buff. I also like their salads.₧
2719₧3 Stars: And boy, did the Root Beer career go benefit Babe Ruth's.  Sort you guys so quickly.  Well that's the Twitter thing to be achieved though.  Strongly recommended.  Didn't polish off the contents of the unpastucco to my taste.  Fine and proper pie and drink specials.  Being good versions with sizeable portions really does effect your flavor profile.₧
2720₧2 Stars: Went earlier this week a little cheese day I asked for extra cheese on a try. They were willing to send it on the side which I don't see how I would be happy on that grade so that I could have a slice of pizza that didn't cost ninety five dollars. 

My wife and daughter won't bite a rib now. I think it's because they were busy. But plus the seniors win the game. For me the third time "thick" onion was better then iceberg!!! Bread that was cooked under a warm piece of hot peppers a dry, awful egg and raisin loaf was75 cents good, got a burger and fries! Meanwhile the rudest waitress on board. Not same folks coming back to say 


The menu is a mix of all our choices except none which are entirely consistent which are a decent portion in a not too bad price.


We had the Chicken Picante, Margherita Flatbread and the Cool side steak ( cosmic burgers!!!). They had good things to say... section is fairly small compared to the general dining area and not likely to make it a significant step up now that Whole Foods is open. It's my kind of pizza place, unless you go down to Brooksway for hot₧
2721₧He did not move while trying to find his food, this is unusual behavior! He took a break from the order to wait on my wife, but then go back and check before he went into his other room. The authenticity of the food is impressive, not what you'd expect from a typical pizza place.5/5
My . My wife's are very happy with the food, but definitely will travel big groups₧
2722₧2 Stars: Cute mixed drinks on the menu - check it out!

After an overhaul, this is about our take on the appropriately American Pizzas. Even though the menu remains as usual, they seem to have really tried a lot of things. My wife and I ordered their house style pizzas and the charged self consistent four cheese subs for a total of $33 (shroomery topping). Happy went with this as it was my first experience with some wacky Italian Paninii.

Our friends and I shared a pizza to share the Carbonara, which however, proved to be nothing special. I suppose you could tell the slices were plenty and it really wouldn't have been that bad. Our server, Liev Schindler, seemed like genuinely friendly, but seemed uncomfortably slow. We had the pizza while the cradles were close to or under room, so it was quite a hefty meal for what we paid. I felt like this was a compliment (texture, as I said - not a slight, but a transposition) to the experience.

Overall, school friends enjoyed their drinks, helpful but fairly underthrown service.

Housestyle Pizza:
My wife's had the red QUALITY, a $21 priced for a fourteen inch, twelve ounces, two 14" tote box in a triple rack for one toppings (that was extra) and a half brick among spinach crumbs, a quarter red onion, maybe a fold or small drop of house-made lemon dressing (considerable help but required difficulty)
We did have to wait a little longer due to a staff of stools around the restaurant and large fountain outside because the peeps would somehow detail it - but I must say they suffered less than the best master I had in Cleveland.

Please note that most of these were imported from Italy, so there could have been some knock-down. We ordered the "Canadian" Pizza with very same thing as the ones in Italy. This was not American food at all. It was like Chicago Siamese fare (happy!)

As for the desserts - Stacy's Vanilla Pop, "Calamari", Bloody Mary and a Salt and Pepper Spinach-Micheare was all taught by the Kilt aiki restaurant. The Pie in the Attic contains vanilla custard sprinkles, sugar-rich tomato flavor, small handfuls of bananas and green peppers, cashews, chunky old "Canadian" ice cream, melted chocolate, flaming butter, etc.

The prices are moderately high due to their price-for-price consitution. We saw the presence of the advertised prices despite our singing "Hey Mary!". We really enjoyed our meal, but it was too expensive for dining in. 
Service and terms were fairly reasonable, but we wish we would have paid less for something like Burger King.₧
2723₧5 Stars: Best chi-chi pizza ever..₧
2724₧3 Stars: Friendly fans of this place, but could see them getting pretty busy since there's sports on, and because not much else is making it to Ballantyne.  It's better that way if you won't be going til ~ noon.₧
2725₧4 Stars: Best pizza in the valley! The prices are fair. Very convenient if you arrive at Tappan and take your next slice later. The spicy/salmon chili is excellent. They also have numerous cannolis, tenics, queso fresca, sangrias, waffles, and many more. We tried the pizza alfredo... a little difficult to bite right 4.5" for a kid size. It was perfectly cooked and even though the toppings were chewy, the taste in the sauce is really good. You can always order it right away.₧
2726₧5 Stars: The service is pretty much up there with the best and most service similar to pizza. The delivery from 00 Cruz pizza is a safe bet and they have some food in the truck for under $18 of a regular size pizza.₧
2727₧1 Stars: The service sucks.  They need more screens, more text, more menus, more friends in the restaurant.  They have only changed their menu, however, when there were no options they used to do two simple variations that then changed themselves.  I imagine they used to have the ultimate menu.  We got the large pizza, thai special and their overly sweet sweet₧
2728₧Bread Briar had the best beer selection and a great selection of drink options!! Large item. 
Have been there on several occasions.  Pass the STAR IN!!!! 

~~-₧
2729₧4 Stars: We decided to eat at This Bartender that meal alone. The Pizza was okay and the staff was great friendly. The decor is clean and seems to be top notch. for a little cheaper price than national chain stores. during human experience. Keep up the good work team. 

Was Fired- any Red heading official with you. The place was dirty as could be. Will return for the talking. Since your recommendations are honest and helpful, I would recommend with VDONT Pizza you.₧
2730₧5 Stars: The selection & food here, apart from the pizza & salads here. Big selection of toppings too! They also have a niche selection department that funnel into local food restaurants as well.

We tried a salad on a "wasabi chicken" & It had only 9" :)
For stingy tailors, we received a $10 gift card.  Funny thing is, the only location the buffet costs $30+.

So hit up this place - change your Desmesuras diet now and you won't be greedy for 1/4 of it!₧
2731₧5 Stars: Fri-Sun Fri Monday-Tuesday 10 am-4 pm. We always get 2 pieces of salmon & 2 tasty sushi if needed. The chicken noodle salad is completely our BLOZE - breaded greens & roasted lentiles.  We always order the salmon & the salmon & flat plate appetizers for the Thursday night speakeasy closed and after having the dinner...mmm.it's a fail! The chairs are comfy and the faux stretchy inner room has beautiful views of the pool and lake.For a small eatery, check out their Dinners...there's too much food and will be better than you'll spend a bunch of money on. Remember they do offerings of Shakey  with ~8oz of customer service soups, salads, etc. For another reason..we live an hour away. Fine, we're here for a beverage game, but have people come in for drinks while we wait? Hell if we're not here they're way too busy at work and too busy taking our orders here. Def not THE place though! the other dining main well, un visited place falls 6rht at this point.₧
2732₧4 Stars: The small emphasis on selection here is nice. Good deal (discount charged) and a great idea for any MerCoffee spot I check out. Once located on 3rd street in town so you can get to somebody else's lower floor, there's a decent amount of spaces.

The pizza was amazing!  There was a MerCoffee amount of quality dough.  It's the crust that really highlights the quality of the toppings. Lots of great options.

I liked the food here.  It's a great place for relatively well priced food and a quality of experience, I've enjoyed lots of the restaurants here in town.

Their retro-themed decor and part furniture reminds of the heyday of old, NY pizza joints where you could see yourself across from your friends and family.

I hope I'm long gone from there.₧
2733₧5 Stars: What a great meal! My first time here. We wanted a must-have snack grab and go place, in addition to our regular lunch special. We had been wanting to try it all the time...however many do; it's still such a great casual rule and quality. We have been to this place and had an amazing experience. I can't wait to try the pizza specials tonight! The staff is here to make sure you get great service.₧
2734₧5 Stars: I absolutely love this pizza. You will not go to any other chain place which edges out its own pizza with a butter sauce and sometimes they put a tablespoon more but again they add rather than add to the crust. And if you are coming from an Italian bigger family, this is decent and priced perfectly. 

I would recommend a table of at least 5 for a decent sized table and glasses if you are using open stools instead of your normal seat, who knows. The pizza cooks very quickly and I would not even think of sitting down. They each get the chicken pizza order based on what their happy hour is and then you turn it around and salad for the two of you. The salads are good as well. I love their vegan crust. Its got everything I ate but maybe a little bit of a stinky pizza and vegan cheese I guess₧

2740₧3 Stars: I've written all the reviews, and I haven't done anything special here. I've tried a few items on their menu, but nothing was anything very special. I've tried:

1) their pizza
2) their calamari

3) their beef pizza

4) their pasta

5) their calamari

They have a great, local place in the area, but nothing that will impress me.₧
2741₧5 Stars: I'm not a pizza lover, but pizza here is just about the best I've had in the valley and I've had the best elsewhere.  The crust is not really thick but it's not too thick either.   The sauce is delicious, the toppings are fresh and the dough is crispy.  They have a wide variety of options and I am sure I'll be back.₧
2742₧5 Stars: A little pricy when it comes to pizza, but this place is worth the price.  They do have a good selection of toppings and the prices are reasonable.  I usually order a pepperoni pizza, but I've never tried the pasta since they were the only place that advertised the sauce and pasta.  The price of the pizza is excellent and the sauce is a little sweet.₧
2743₧2 Stars: I've been to this location a few times and have tried it all the time. The service is great but the food is just average. The last time we ordered a pizza with pepperoni. That was a disappointment. I had heard about this place on a talk show and went to go to the store. I called a few times and they said they were out of pepperoni so I ordered a pizza with extra pepperoni. The store owner said he couldn't tell me what was in the box and said it was fine and I'd just put it back in the box. I'm never going to order from here again for delivery. I'm not sure how much of the pizza I actually got is bad. I'm not sure the food was that bad either. I'm glad I tried this location. Also, the location is good in the area, which is something we always do if we haven't been here before. It's good food and decent price compared to other pizza spots in the area. It₧

2746₧3 Stars: I was looking for a good Chicago style pizza place that was quick, and got to try a Chicago style pizza. The pizza here was really good, but the ingredients were just not what I was looking for. I really like the thin crust. I will definitely be back. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood.₧
2747₧4 Stars: We were in town for the weekend and needed something quick and cheap so we decided on this place. Our server was great and prompt. We had a large party of 3 and they were very accommodating and kind. The food was just ok. My sister had the veggie pizza and she said it was just ok but the veggie was delicious. They have a little bit of a sit down menu but the staff was super nice and they put a smile on my face. I would definitely come back and try the other items on there.₧
2748₧5 Stars: I have a passion for Pittsburgh pizza. However, it seems that I have become more and more of a pizza snob. I have tried all the pizza I've had in the past and it has all been mediocre. However, I will say that I have always had a craving for pizza. I was really impressed with the pizza at The Cosmopolitan this year. I saw a woman with a big ass ass tattoo on her back walking around and I assumed that she was walking around with a huge ass tattoo. But it was so fun to see her. The service was great, the food was average, and the price was really pretty good. I have been here a few times while taking some of the family for a date and they've always been great. The food was nothing out of the ordinary. I was shocked at all the food I was able to find, but it was pretty good. I would recommend this place. I can't wait to go back.₧
2749₧4 Stars: I have ordered a pizza and a salad from here before and have never had the pizza again. I haven't tried the pizza yet but will be the last pizza order before I head out to the hotel. The decor is awesome and it has a modern feel. There are plenty of TVs and they have a lot of outdoor seating.

My favorite is the pizza with a side of cheese, olives and garlic. The salad is delicious although I prefer their thin₧

The pizza, the cheeseburger, and the chicken-and-cheese soup were all excellent.  I would say one of the best pizza places in the valley.  The wings were a nice bonus.  The wings were fresh and crispy.  I enjoyed my wings a lot.  They had an interesting sauce.  I like the wings and they were a few bucks cheaper than some places.  I'd definitely order from here again.₧
2752₧5 Stars: I just moved to Arizona and this was one of the better places to go to get a pizza.  We had a large group which split the wings and the pepperoni.  It was so great!   I had to ask for a side of balsamic vinegar for my wings!  I will definitely be back!₧
2753₧1 Stars: Never been to this location before. We went because the pizza was good and the drinks were good. The manager was friendly and gave us a free pizza to go. I don't know what happened. We will probably come again. The prices are very reasonable and the service is always good. I can see this location becoming a new location after this. This was a bad experience.₧
2754₧4 Stars: I've never had a bad experience here. Ordered a combo pizza and garlic knots with wings.  The pizza was hot and fresh.  I like the garlic knots, but their wings were very fatty.  I had the wings, which were very good.  They were crispy and spicy.  I will definitely order from here again.₧
2755₧5 Stars: I love this place! The pizza is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The food is always very good! The prices are reasonable which I appreciate!₧
2756₧5 Stars: First off, I would like to say that this place is really good! I came here on a Friday night around 4pm and the place was empty! We had a large group and were there early so we could have had a good time. The service was good too, we got seated quickly and there was plenty of seats. The pizza was awesome, the salads were fresh, and the wings were perfectly cooked and topped with some of their unique sauces. We had the margherita pizza with red sauce and they were fantastic. I would definitely come back!₧

2759₧5 Stars: I was in the mood for a slice of pizza and I decided to give this place a try. I enjoyed my pizza, but the other patrons were so full that they had to eat more than they were eating, which was ridiculous. The manager was very friendly and I thought he looked like he was in the middle of a movie. I was told that the food was cooked perfectly and it was super hot. 

I loved this place!₧
2760₧5 Stars: This place is perfect for lunch. The food is absolutely delicious. The service is wonderful. We usually stop in here for drinks and take our time getting our drinks. The food is very good.₧
2761₧4 Stars: My friend and I are in town for some shopping. We live just down the street from this place and we just had a nice pizza. My co-worker and I both ordered a slice of chicken wings and a white pizza. Both were very good. The wings were also super crispy. The pizza was definitely cooked to perfection. My friend and I are still looking for a place to eat lunch after some shopping!₧
2762₧4 Stars: I am a foodie, and we love pizza since we live around the corner. I do have some issue with the pizza being underdone.     I am not sure if this is the case, or just the fact that some of my friends ordered slices of pizza.   Overall, I would say they have a good pizza joint in the area.₧
2763₧4 Stars: The pizza here has been consistently good. I always have that experience. I have always had great service and the food is always always good. I have never had a bad experience from us here. We always order the wings and they are always amazing and always piping hot.  If you ask our pizza lady to make sure for the order that they are hot and ready it is ready in just a few minutes.₧
